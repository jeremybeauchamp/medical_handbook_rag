## Oliguria/anuria

Oliguria is defined as a urine output of <400mL/24h or <0.5mL/kg/h and can be a sign of shock (eg post-op, p576) or acute kidney injury: causes: p298. Anuria is defined as <50mL/24h. In a catheterized patient with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage, with slow decline of oliguria to anuria renal dysfunction is more likely.

## Polyuria

Increased urine volume, eg >3L/24h. Causes: Over-enthusiastic IV fluid therapy; diabetes mellitus & insipidus (diabetes is Greek for fountain);↑Ca2+; psychogenic polydipsia/ PIP syndrome (p240); polyuric phase of recovering acute tubular necrosis.

## Irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms

(See also p642.) Symptoms of prostate enlargement are miscalled 'prostatism'; it is better to talk about irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms, as bladder neck obstruction or a stricture may be the cause.

1. Irritative bladder symptoms: Urgency, dysuria, frequency, nocturia* (the last two are also associated with causes of polyuria).
2. Obstructive symptoms: Reduced size and force of urinary stream, hesitancy and interruption of stream during voiding and terminal dribbling—the usual cause is enlargement of the prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), but other causes include a urethral stricture, tumour, urethral valves, or bladder neck contracture. The maximum flow rate of urine is normally ~18-30mL/s.

## Terminal dribbling

Dribbling at the end of urination, often seen in conjunction with incontinence following incomplete urination, associated with prostatism.

## Urinary changes

Cloudy urine suggests pus (UTI) but is often normal phosphate precipitation in an alkaline urine. Pneumaturia (bubbles in urine as it is passed). Occurs with UTI due to gas-forming organisms or may signal an enterovesical (bowel-bladder) fistula from diverticulitis, Crohn's disease or neoplastic disease of the bowel. Nocturia occurs with 'irritative bladder', diabetes mellitus, UTI, and reversed diurnal rhythm (seen in renal and cardiac failure). Haematuria (RBC in urine) is due to neoplasia or glomerulonephritis (p310) until proven otherwise. Rule out UTI.

## Voiding difficulty

This includes poor flow, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittent stream, incontinence (eg overflow), retention (acute or chronic), incomplete emptying (±UTI from residual urine). ►Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with overflow. Causes:
Obstructive: prostatic hyperplasia, early oedema after bladder neck repair, uterine prolapse, retroverted gravid uterus, fibroids, ovarian cysts, urethral foreign body, ectopic ureterocele, bladder polyp, or cancer. Bladder overdistension—eg after epidural for childbirth. Detrusor weakness or myopathy causes incomplete emptying + dribbling overflow incontinence (do cystometry/electromyography; causes include neurological disease and interstitial cystitis (OHCS p306); it may lead to a contracted bladder, eg requiring substitution enterocystoplasty). Drugs: epidural anaesthesia; tricyclics, anticholinergics. CNS: suprapontine (stroke); cord lesions (cord injury, multiple sclerosis); peripheral nerve (prolapsed disc, diabetic or other neuropathy); or reflex, due to pain (eg with herpes infections).

6 In the elderly, nocturia (1-2/night) may be 'normal' because of: i) loss of ability to concentrate urine; ii) peripheral oedema fluid returns to the circulation at night; iii) circadian rhythms may be lost; iv) less sleep is needed and waking may be interpreted as a need to void (a conditioned Pavlovian response).
