# Malaria: diagnosis

## Epidemiology

- 3.2 billion people at risk in 95 countries = half the world's population (fig 9.23).
- 214 million/cases per year with 438 000 deaths.
- Sub-Saharan Africa: 88% of malaria cases, 90% of deaths (most age <5yr).
- Most common tropical disease imported into UK, ~2000 cases/yr.
- ~20% fever in travellers from Africa presenting to UK hospitals is due to malaria.
- Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent parasite in Africa and responsible for most malaria deaths worldwide (=~75% of malaria presenting in UK).
- Plasmodium vivax is the dominant parasite outside of sub-Saharan Africa.
- Preventable and treatable: incidence ↓ by 37% and deaths ↓ by 60% since 2000.

## Malaria parasites

Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium. >100 species exist of which 5 cause human disease (see table 9.19). Transmission occurs through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Only female mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium as only females require a blood meal for egg development. Transmission in the absence of a mosquito is rare: vertical (congenital transfer from mother to child), transfusion, organ transplantation, needle-sharing.
