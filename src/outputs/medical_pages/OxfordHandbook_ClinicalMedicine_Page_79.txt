## Cramp
This is painful muscle spasm. Leg cramps are common at night or after heavy exercise, and in patients with renal impairment or on dialysis. Cramp can signify salt depletion, and rarely: muscle ischaemia (claudication, DM), myopathy (McArdle, p704), or dystonia (writer's cramp, p469). Forearm cramps suggest motor neuron disease. Night cramps may respond to quinine bisulfate 300mg at night PO.

**Drugs causing cramp:** Diuretics (? from K+), domperidone, salbutamol/terbutaline IVI, ACE-i, telmisartan, celecoxib, lacidipine, ergot alkaloids, levothyroxine.

## Paraesthesiae
'Pins and needles', numbness/tingling, which can hurt or 'burn' (dysaesthesia).

**Causes:**
*Metabolic,* ↓Ca2+ (perioral); ↑PCO2; myxoedema; neurotoxins (tick bite; sting). *Vascular,* arterial emboli; Raynaud's; DVT; high plasma viscosity. *Antibody-mediated,* paraneoplastic; SLE; ITP. *Infection,* rare: Lyme; rabies. *Drugs,* ACE-i. *Brain,* thalamic/parietal lesions. *Cord,* MS; myelitis/HIV; ↓B12; lumbar fracture. *Plexopathy/mononeuropathy,* see p502, cervical rib; carpal tunnel; sciatica. *Peripheral neuropathy,* glove & stocking, p504, eg DM; CKD. If *paroxysmal,* migraine; epilepsy; phaeochromocytoma. If *wandering,* take travel history, consider infection, eg strongyloides.

## Tremor
Tremor is rhythmic oscillation of limbs, trunk, head, or tongue. Three types:

1. **Resting tremor**—worst at rest—eg from parkinsonism (±bradykinesia and rigidity; tremor is more resistant to treatment than other symptoms). It is usually a slow tremor (frequency of 3-5Hz), typically 'pill-rolling' of the thumb over a finger.

2. **Postural tremor**—worst if arms are outstretched. Typically rapid (8-12Hz). May be exaggerated physiological tremor (eg anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, drugs), due to brain damage (eg Wilson's disease, syphilis) or benign essential tremor (BET). This is often familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of arms and head presenting at any age. Cogwheeling may occur but there is no bradykinesia. It is suppressed by alcohol, and patients may self-medicate rather than admit problems. Rarely progressive (unless onset is unilateral). Propranolol (40-80mg/8-12h PO) can help, but not in all patients.

3. **Intention tremor**—worst on movement, seen in cerebellar disease, with past-pointing and dysdiadochokinesis (see p499). No effective drug has been found.

## Facial pain
**CNS causes:** Migraine, trigeminal, or glossopharyngeal neuralgia (p457) or from any other pain-sensitive structure in the head or neck. *Post-herpetic neuralgia:* nasty burning-and-stabbing pain involves dermatomal areas affected by shingles (p404); it may affect cranial nerves V and VII in the face. It all too often becomes chronic and intractable (skin affected is exquisitely sensitive). Treatment is hard. Always give strong psychological support. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation, capsaicin ointment, and infiltrating local anaesthetic are tried. Neuropathic pain agents, such as amitriptyline, eg 10-25mg/24h at night, or gabapentin (p504) may help. NB: famciclovir or valaciclovir given in acute shingles may ↓ duration of neuralgia.14

**Vascular and non-neurological causes:**
- *Neck*—cervical disc pathology.
- *Bone/sinuses*—sinusitis; neoplasia.
- *Eye*—glaucoma; iritis; orbital cellulitis; eye strain; AVM.
- *Temporomandibular joint*—arthritis or idiopathic dysfunction (common).
- *Teeth/gums*—caries; broken teeth; abscess; malocclusion.
- *Ear*—otitis media; otitis externa.
- *Vascular/vasculitis*—arteriovenous fistula; aneurysm; or AVM at the cerebellopontine angle; giant cell arteritis; SLE.
