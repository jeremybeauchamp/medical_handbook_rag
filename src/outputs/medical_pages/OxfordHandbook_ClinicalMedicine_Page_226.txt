## Diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot care

▶Refer early to foot services (podiatry, imaging, vascular surgery).
Amputations are common (135/week)—and preventable: good care saves legs.
Examine feet regularly. Distinguish between ischaemia (critical toes ± absent foot
pulses and worse outcome) and peripheral neuropathy (injury or infection over pressure points, eg the metatarsal heads). In practice, many have both.

**Neuropathy** Sensation in 'stocking' distribution: test sensation with a 10g monofilament fibre (sensory loss is patchy so examine all areas), absent ankle jerks, neuropathic deformity (Charcot joint, fig 5.11): pes cavus, claw toes, loss of transverse arch,
rocker-bottom sole. Caused by loss of pain sensation, leading to mechanical stress
and repeated joint injury. Swelling, instability, and deformity. ▶Early recognition is
vital (cellulitis or osteomyelitis are often misdiagnosed).

**Ischaemia** If the foot pulses cannot be felt, do Doppler pressure measurements.
Any evidence of neuropathy or vascular disease raises risk of foot ulceration.
Educate (daily foot inspection—eg with a mirror for the sole; comfortable shoes).
Regular chiropody to remove callus, as haemorrhage and tissue necrosis may occur below, leading to ulceration. Treat fungal infections (p408). Surgery (including
endovascular angioplasty balloons, stents, and subintimal recanalization) has a role.

**Foot ulceration** Typically painless, punched-out ulcer (fig 5.10) in an area of thick
callus ± superadded infection. Causes cellulitis, abscess ± osteomyelitis.

Assess degree of:
1 Neuropathy (clinically).
2 Ischaemia (clinically + Doppler ± angiography).
3 Bony deformity, eg Charcot joint (clinically + x-ray). See fig 5.11.
4 Infection (swabs, blood culture, x-ray for osteomyelitis, probe ulcer to reveal depth).

Management: Regular chiropody. Bed rest ± therapeutic shoes. For Charcot joints:
bed rest/crutches/total contact cast until oedema and local warmth reduce and
bony repair is complete (≥8wks). Bisphosphonates may help. Charcot joints are also
seen in tabes dorsalis, spina bifida, syringomyelia, and leprosy. Metatarsal head surgery may be needed. If there is cellulitis, admit for IV antibiotics. Common organisms: staphs, streps, anaerobes. Start empirically (as per your local guidance) with
benzylpenicillin 1.2g/6h IV and flucloxacillin 1g/6h IV ± metronidazole 500mg/8h IV.
IV insulin may improve healing. Get surgical help early. The degree of peripheral vascular disease, general health, and patient request will determine degree of vascular
reconstruction/surgery.

▶Absolute indications for surgery: Abscess or deep infection; spreading anaerobic
infection; gangrene/rest pain; suppurative arthritis.

**Diabetic neuropathies** Symmetric sensory polyneuropathy: ('glove & stocking'
numbness, tingling, and pain, eg worse at night). ℞: paracetamol → tricyclic (amitriptyline 10-25mg nocte; gradually ↑ to 150mg) → duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin → opiates. Avoiding weight-bearing helps. Mononeuritis multiplex: (eg III & VI
cranial nerves). Treatment: hard! If sudden or severe, immunosuppression may help
(corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, ciclosporin). Amyotrophy: Painful wasting of
quadriceps and other pelvifemoral muscles. Use electrophysiology to show, eg lumbosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy, or proximal crural neuropathy. Natural course:
variable with gradual but often incomplete improvement. IV immunoglobulins have
been used. Autonomic neuropathy: (p505) Postural BP drop; ↓cerebrovascular autoregulation; loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (vagal neuropathy); gastroparesis;
urine retention; erectile dysfunction; gustatory sweating; diarrhoea (may respond
to codeine phosphate). Gastroparesis (early satiety, post-prandial bloating, nausea/
vomiting) is diagnosed by gastric scintigraphy with a ⁹⁹technetium-labelled meal;
anti-emetics, erythromycin, or gastric pacing. Postural hypotension may respond to
fludrocortisone (SE: oedema, ↑BP)/midodrine (α-agonist; SE: ↑BP).
