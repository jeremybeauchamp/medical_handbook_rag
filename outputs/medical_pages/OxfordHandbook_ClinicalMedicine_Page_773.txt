# Nasogastric tubes

These tubes are passed into the stomach via the nose. Large (eg 16F) are good for drainage but can be uncomfortable for patients. Small (eg 10F) are more comfortable for feeding but can be difficult to aspirate and are poor for drainage. Used:
• To decompress the stomach/gastrointestinal tract especially when there is obstruction, eg gastric outflow obstruction, ileus, intestinal obstruction.
• For gastric lavage.
• To administer feed/drugs, especially in critically ill patients or those with dysphagia, eg motor neuron disease, post CVA.

## Passing the tube
Nurses are experts and will ask you (who may never have passed one) to do so only when they fail—so the first question to ask is: 'Have you asked the charge-nurse from the ward next door?'
• Wear non-sterile gloves and an apron to protect both you and the patient.
• Explain the procedure. Take a new, cool (hence less flexible) tube. Have a cup of water to hand. Lubricate well with aqueous gel.
• Use the tube, by holding it against the patient's head, to estimate the length required to get from the nostril to the back of the throat.
• Place lubricated tube in nostril with its natural curve promoting passage down, rather than up. The right nostril is often easier than the left but, if feasible, ask the patient for their preference. Advance directly backwards (not upwards).
• When the tip is estimated to be entering the throat, rotate the tube by ~180° to discourage passage into the mouth.
• Ask the patient to swallow a sip of water, and advance as they do, timing each push with a swallow. If this fails: Try the other nostril.
• The tube has distance markings along it: the stomach is at ~35-40cm in adults, so advance > this distance, preferably 10-20cm beyond. Tape securely to the nose.

## Confirming position
This is vital prior to commencing any treatment through the tube. Misplaced nasogastric tubes have led to a number of preventable deaths, and feeding via a misplaced tube is considered an NHS Never Event (a serious, largely preventable patient safety incident that should never occur if the available preventative measures have been implemented).
• Use pH paper to test that you are in the stomach: aspirated gastric contents are acid (pH ≤5.5) although antacids or PPIs may increase the pH. Small tubes can be difficult to aspirate, try withdrawing or advancing a few cm or turning the patient on the left side to help dip the tube in gastric contents. Aspirates should be >0.5mL and tested directly on unhandled pH paper. Allow 10s for colour change to occur.
• If the pH is >5.5 and the NGT is needed for drug or feed administration then the position must be checked radiologically. Request a CXR/abdo X-ray (tell the radiologist why you need it). Look for the radio-opaque line/tip (this can be hard to see, look below the diaphragm, but if in doubt, ask for help from the radiologist).
• The 'whoosh' test is NOT an accepted method of testing for tube position.
• Either spigot the tube, or allow to drain into a dependent catheter bag secured to clothing (zinc oxide tape around tube to form a flap, safety pin through flap).

> Do not pass a tube nasally if there is any suspicion of a facial fracture.

> Get senior help if the patient has recently had upper GI surgery—it is not good practice to push the tube through a fresh anastomosis.

## Complications
• Pain, or, rarely: • Loss of electrolytes • Oesophagitis • Tracheal or duodenal intubation • Necrosis: retro- or nasopharyngeal • Stomach perforation.

## Weaning
When planning removal of an NGT in situ for decompression or relief of obstruction, it is wise to wean it so that the patient manages well without it. Drainage should be <750mL/24 hours for successful weaning.
• First it should be on free drainage with, eg, 4hrly aspirations.
• Then spigot with 4hrly aspirations.
• Then spigot only. If this is tolerated along with oral intake then it is probably safe to remove the tube; if not, then take a step backwards.
