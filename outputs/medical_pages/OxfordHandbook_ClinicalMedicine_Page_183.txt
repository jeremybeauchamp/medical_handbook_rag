# Avian influenza

Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans and most follow direct or close contact with infected poultry. The issue remains a public health priority because of the ability of the virus to mutate. Symptoms range from conjunctivitis to influenza-like illness (low pathogenic forms) to severe respiratory illness and multi-organ failure (highly pathogenic forms). H7N9 and H5N1 have been responsible for most human illnesses worldwide. Suspect avian flu if fever (>38°C), chest signs or consolidation on CXR, or life-threatening infection, and contact with poultry or others with similar symptoms. NB: D&V, abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, and bleeding from the nose and gums are reported to be an early feature in some patients.

**Diagnosis:** Viral culture ± reverse transcriptase-PCR with H5 & N1 specific primers.

**Management:** Get help. Contain the outbreak, p397, in the UK, via your consultant in communicable disease control. Ventilatory support + O2 and antivirals may be needed. Most viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. Nebulizers and high-air flow O2 masks are implicated in nosocomial spread.

**Precautions for close contacts of infected patients:**
Hand hygiene, avoid shared utensils and face-to-face contact, wear high-efficiency masks and eye protection. Start empirical antiviral treatment (oseltamivir within 48 hours of exposure and zanamivir within 36 hours). Monitor for fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, or other systemic symptoms developing.

# Coronaviruses: SARS and MERS

**Severe acute respiratory syndrome** (SARS) is caused by SARS-CoV virus—a coronavirus. Major features are persistent fever (>38°C), chills, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, headache, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea—with an abnormal CXR and WCC. Respiratory failure is a complicating feature: ~20% progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation. Mortality is 1-50%, depending on age, but no cases since 2004. Close contacts, or travel to an area with known cases should raise suspicion. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV is human-human. **Management:** seek expert help. Largely supportive with good infection control measures.

**Middle East respiratory syndrome** (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) and was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal upset. Incubation period 14 days. Human-to-human transmission has been reported in most cases, but camels play a pivotal host role in animal-to-human transmission. Large outbreaks linked to healthcare facilities have been reported in the Middle East and South Korea. The World Health Organization has reported mortality as high as 36% in known cases.

Therapeutic or prophylactic antivirals are said to be the most effective single intervention followed by vaccine and basic public health measures. But oseltamivir resistance and unavailability of a suitable vaccine during the early stages of a pandemic make non-drug interventions all the more important.
