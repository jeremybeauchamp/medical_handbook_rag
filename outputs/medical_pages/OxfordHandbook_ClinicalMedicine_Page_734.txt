# The art of the request

One of the most nerve-wracking moments that you can encounter as a recently qualified doctor is having to request an investigation from a seasoned consultant radiologist. What information do you need to give? How much? Who do you ask? Put yourself on the other side: what does the radiologist need to know to decide who needs what imaging and when? Keep the following in mind when requesting (never ordering!) an investigation:

## Patient details
Get the patient's name right! Include hospital number and date of birth on all requests.

## Clinical details
Think of your clinical question, what answer are you hoping radiology will provide? It can:

- Confirm a suspected diagnosis.
- 'Exclude' something important (though remember that exclusion is never 100%).
- Define the extent of a disease.
- Monitor the progress of a disease.

Don't forget to mention pertinent facts that may change the way the investigation is carried out: an agitated or confused patient may need sedation prior to an MRI of their head. A CT scan on a patient with an acutely raised creatinine may need to be done without contrast medium. Insertion of a drain on a patient with deranged clotting may need to wait while this is corrected. Include recent creatinine, Hb, and clotting on the form if appropriate. Don't forget to mention anticoagulants, eg warfarin, LMWH, and aspirin for intervention requests.

## Investigation details
What scan do you think is required, and how soon do you need it? Different clinical questions require different procedures. If you think the patient has a collection, would you like them to drain it? Always state whether intervention is required (eg US abdo Â± drain insertion). Remember that the radiologist ultimately decides what imaging or procedure they undertake based on the information you have provided.

## Tips
- Know your patient well, but keep your request brief and accurate.
- Know the clinical question and how the answer will change your management.
- Look up previous imaging before you go; asking for a CT on a patient who had one yesterday makes you look foolish and will not go down well.
- If in doubt, or if the investigation is very urgent, go down to the department in person. Regard this as an important opportunity: involving a radiologist will result in the best selection of imaging technique for your clinical question, will help expedite urgent requests, and should be of educational value for you.

## If your request is turned down
Don't be afraid to (politely) ask why. If you or your team still feel it is warranted, look back at the request; did you miss a relevant piece of information that would change the mind of the radiologist? If you still draw a blank, try speaking to a radiologist who specializes in that particular technique. Many teams have clinical radiology meetings; think about approaching someone who appreciates why you are asking that particular question. Alternatively, go back to your team; speak to your senior, who may have a better understanding of why the investigation is needed and be able to convey this to the radiologist.

Remember that there is a patient at the heart of this, and you are their advocate. If the results of an investigation will change their management then explain this to the radiologist. Moreover, don't forget to explain it to your patient. Being whisked off to the department for investigation and intervention can be particularly terrifying if you aren't expecting it.
