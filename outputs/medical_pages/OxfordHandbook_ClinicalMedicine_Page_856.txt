# Some specific poisons and their antidotes

## Benzodiazepines
Flumazenil (for respiratory arrest) 200mcg over 15s; then 100mcg at 60s intervals if needed. Usual dose range: 300-600mcg IV over 3-6min (up to 1mg; 2mg if on ICU). May provoke fits. Use only after expert advice.

## β-blockers
Severe bradycardia or hypotension. Try atropine up to 3mg IV. Give glucagon 2-10mg IV bolus + 5% glucose if atropine fails then infusion of 50mcg/kg/h. Also consider including phosphodiesterase inhibitor infusions (eg enoximone 5-20mcg/kg/min). If unresponsive, consider pacing.

## Cyanide
This fast-killing poison has affinity for Fe3+, and inhibits the cytochrome system, aerobic respiration (therefore patients are acidotic with raised lactate). Depending on degree of poisoning presentation can be:
- *Mild:* Dizziness, anxiety, tachycardia, nausea, drowsiness/confusion.
- *Moderate:* Vomiting, reduced consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis.
- *Severe:* Deep coma, fixed unreactive pupils, cardiorespiratory failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema.

Treatment: ▶▶100% O2, GI decontamination. If mild, supportive care is usually sufficient. If moderate/severe then specific treatment to bind cyanide is required. Give sodium nitrite/sodium thiosulfate, or dicobalt edetate 300mg IV over 1min, then 50mL 50% glucose IV (repeat once if no response after a minute); or hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit®) 5g over 15min repeated once if required. Get expert help. See p847.

## Carbon monoxide
Despite hypoxaemia skin is pink (or pale), not blue, as carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) displaces O2 from Hb binding sites. For the same reasons SpO2 from a pulse oximeter may be normal. Check ABG in a co-oximeter (ie ensure it measures haemoglobin, SaO2, Meth-Hb and COHb) which will show low SaO2 and high COHb (normal <5%). Symptoms: Headache, vomiting, ↑pulse, tachypnoea, and, if COHb >50%, fits, coma, and cardiac arrest.

Treatment: ▶▶Remove the source. Give 100% O2 until COHb <10%. Metabolic acidosis usually responds to correction of hypoxia. If severe, anticipate cerebral oedema and give mannitol IVI (p831). Confirm diagnosis with an ABG quickly as levels may soon return to normal. Monitor ECG. If COHb >20%, patient has neurological or psychological features, or cardiovascular impairment, fails to respond to treatment, or is pregnant, consider hyperbaric O2: discuss with the poisons service.

## Digoxin
Symptoms: ↓Cognition, yellow-green visual halos, arrhythmias, nausea, and anorexia. If serious arrhythmias are present, correct hypokalaemia, and inactivate with digoxin-specific antibody fragments (DigiFab®). If load or level is unknown, give 20 vials (800mg)—adult or child >20kg.

## Heavy metals
Enlist expert help.

## Iron
Desferrioxamine 15mg/kg/h IVI; max 80mg/kg/d. NB: gastric lavage if iron ingestion in last hour; consider whole-bowel irrigation.

## Oral anticoagulants
See p351. If major bleed, give vitamin K 5mg slow IV and prothrombin complex concentrate 50U/kg IV (or if unavailable, fresh frozen plasma 15mL/kg IVI). For abnormal INR with no (or minimal) bleeding, see BNF. If it is vital that anticoagulation continues, enlist expert help. Discuss with haematology. NB: coagulation defects may be delayed for 2-3d following ingestion.

## Opiates
(Many analgesics contain opiates.) Give naloxone, eg 0.4-2mg IV; repeat every 2min until breathing is adequate (it has a short t½, so it may need to be given often or IM; max ~10mg). Naloxone may precipitate features of opiate withdrawal—diarrhoea and cramps, which will normally respond to diphenoxylate and atropine (eg co-phenotrope). Sedate as needed (see p15). High-dose opiate misusers may need methadone (eg 10-30mg/24h PO) to combat withdrawal. Refer for help (OHCS p374).
