# When should TIA lead to emergency referral?

The ABCD² score is a helpful tool to stratify which patients are at higher risk of having a stroke following a suspected TIA (table 10.6).

## Table 10.6 The ABCD² score

| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Age ≥60 yrs old | 1 point |
| Blood pressure ≥140/90 | 1 point |
| Clinical features |  |
| - Unilateral weakness | 2 points |
| - Speech disturbance without weakness | 1 point |
| Duration of symptoms |  |
| - Symptoms lasting ≥1h | 2 points |
| - Symptoms lasting 10-59min | 1 point |
| Diabetes | 1 point |

A score of ≥4 indicates that the patient is at high risk of an early stroke, and must be assessed by a specialist within 24h. A score of ≥6 strongly predicts a stroke (8.1% within 2 days, 35.5% in the next week). Other factors that suggest increased risk are:
- AF
- >1 TIA in a week
- TIA while anticoagulated.

Crucially, risk is lowest if the patient is treated in a specialized stroke unit (p474).
