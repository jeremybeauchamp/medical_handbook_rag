# Lumbar puncture (LP)

**Contraindications** •Bleeding diathesis. •Cardiorespiratory compromise. •Infection at site of needle insertion. Most importantly: ↑↑ICP (suspect if very severe headache, ↓level of consciousness with falling pulse, rising BP, vomiting, focal neurology, or papilloedema)—LP in these patients will cause coning, so unless it is a routine procedure, eg for known idiopathic intracranial hypertension, obtain a CT prior to LP. CT is not infallible, so be sure your indication for LP is strong.

**Method** Explain to the patient what sampling CSF entails, why it is needed, that co-operation is vital, and that they can communicate with you at all stages.

• Place the patient on his or her left side, with the back on the edge of the bed, fully flexed (knees to chin). A pillow under the head and another between the knees may keep them more stable.

• Landmarks: plane of iliac crests through the level of L3/4 (see fig 18.8). In adults, the spinal cord ends at the L1/2 disc (fig 18.9). Mark L3/4 intervertebral space (or one space below, L4/5), eg by a gentle indentation of a needle cap on the overlying skin (better than a ballpoint pen mark, which might be erased by the sterilizing fluid).

• Use aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves, gown) and 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol to clean the skin, allow to dry and then place sterile drapes.

• Open the spinal pack. Assemble the manometer and 3-way tap. Have three plain sterile tubes and one fluoride tube (for glucose) ready.

• Using a 25G (orange) needle, raise a bleb of local anaesthetic, then use a 21G (green) needle to infiltrate deeper.

• Wait 1min, then insert spinal needle (22G, stilette in place) perpendicular to the body, through your mark, aiming slightly up towards the umbilicus. Feel resistance of spinal ligaments, and then the dura, then a 'give' as the needle enters the subarachnoid space. NB: keep the bevel of the needle facing up, parallel with dural fibres.

• Withdraw stilette. Check CSF fills needle and attach manometer (3-way tap turned off towards you) to measure 'opening' pressure.

• Catch fluid in three sequentially numbered bottles (10 drops per tube).

• Reinsert stilette then remove needle and apply dressing. Document the procedure clearly in the notes including CSF appearance and opening pressure.

• Send CSF promptly for *microscopy, culture, protein, lactate, and glucose* (do plasma glucose too)—call the lab to let them know. If applicable, also send for: cytology, fungal studies, TB culture, virology (± herpes and other PCR), syphilis serology, oligoclonal bands (+serum sample for comparison) if multiple sclerosis suspected. Is there xanthochromia (p478)?

• If you fail; ask for help—try with the patient sitting or with radiological guidance.

**CSF composition** *Normal values:* Lymphocytes <5/mm³; no polymorphs; protein <0.4g/L; glucose >2.2mmol/L (or ≥50% plasma level); pressure <200mm CSF. *In meningitis:* See p822. *In multiple sclerosis:* See p496.

**Bloody tap:** This is an artefact due to piercing a blood vessel, which is indicated (unreliably) by fewer red cells in successive bottles, and no yellowing of CSF (xanthochromia). To estimate how many white cells (W) were in the CSF before the blood was added, use the following:

W = CSF WCC - [(blood WCC × CSF RBC) ÷ blood RBC].

If the blood count is normal, the rule of thumb is to subtract from the total CSF WCC (per μL) one white cell for every 1000 RBCs. To estimate the true protein level, subtract 10mg/L for every 1000 RBCs/mm³ (be sure to do the count and protein estimation on the same bottle). NB: high protein levels in CSF make it appear yellow. *Subarachnoid haemorrhage:* Xanthochromia (yellow supernatant on spun CSF). Red cells in equal numbers in all bottles (unreliable). RBCs will excite an inflammatory response (eg CSF WCC raised), most marked after 48h. *Raised protein:* Meningitis; MS; Guillain–Barré syndrome. *Very raised CSF protein:* Spinal block; TB; or severe bacterial meningitis.
