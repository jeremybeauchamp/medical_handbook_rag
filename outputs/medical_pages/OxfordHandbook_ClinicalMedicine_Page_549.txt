## Insomnia

**Causes:** Terminally ill patients may experience physical and emotional exhaustion. Often multifactorial. Poor sleep can increase symptom burden.

**Treatment:** Simple steps may make a big difference: appropriate room temperature, darkness, and quiet during the night (request a side room for in-patients). Give prescribed glucocorticoids in the morning. Avoid waking patients for late medications and routine observations. Discuss and address psychosocial issues. In some cases zopiclone or benzodiazepines may be used to help patients rest and re-establish normal sleep-wake cycles (may exacerbate delirium).

## Pruritus

**Causes:** Systemic disease (renal failure, hepatitis, polycythaemia), cancer-related (cholestasis, lymphoma, leukaemia, hepatoma, myeloma, paraneoplastic), primary-skin disease, drug reaction (opioids, SSRI, chemotherapy).

**Treatment:** Underlying causes where possible: cholestasis (biliary stenting, colestyramine, sertraline, rifampicin), opioid-induced (antihistamine, opioid switch), paraneoplastic (paroxetine). Topical emollients regularly and as a soap substitute. Avoid topical antihistamines due to risk of contact dermatitis.

## Venepuncture

Repeated venepuncture with the risk of painful extravasation and phlebitis may be avoided by use of a central catheter (eg HickmanÂ® tunnelled line or PICC). Problems: infection, blockage (flush with 0.9% saline or dilute heparin every week), axillary thrombosis, and line slippage.

## Spiritual pain

Spirituality is a means of experiencing life. It relates to the way in which people understand and live their lives. It is comprised of elements including meaning, purpose, and something greater than 'self'. It is distinct from faith, which is a religious experience, that may or may not be part of spirituality. Spiritual pain or suffering is common when people are facing death. It can include feelings of hopelessness, guilt, isolation, meaninglessness, and confusion. Consider:

- the past: painful memories, guilt
- the present: isolation, anger
- the future: fear, hopelessness.

Reminiscence helps address the past, provides context, and offers recognition of the patient as an individual. Anger should be acknowledged. Fear of the imagined future may not change, but is potentially reduced through discussion. The nature of hope may need to be modified. If hope for a cure is inappropriate, it should not be the main or only hope. Realistic hopes include discharge from hospital, seeing family members happy, being remembered. Making a will, handing over responsibilities, and dealing with unfinished business facilitate control and may allow a sense of completion.

Remember the whole person: history, coping mechanisms, state of well-being. Elements such as these will alter how disease affects the patient and how the patient responds to disease.

Companionship is essential in spiritual support. At times a doctor needs to modify their role to simply accompany the dying patient. This is manageable within established professional boundaries and therapeutic. If you cannot do this, find someone who can: palliative care teams, Macmillan nurses, and chaplains (a listening ear for patients of all faiths and none) are all valuable resources.

Spiritual pain is exacerbated by physical symptoms. These must be addressed if spiritual support is to be effective.
