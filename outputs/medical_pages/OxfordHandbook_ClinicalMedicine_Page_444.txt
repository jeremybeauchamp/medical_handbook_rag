## Gastroenteritis: specific infections

### Diarrhoea without blood

**Norovirus:** Single-stranded RNA virus. Highly infectious. Transmission by contact with infected people, environment, food (~10%). Most common cause of infectious GI disease, ~600 000 cases in England/yr. Presentation: 12–48h after exposure, lasting 24–72h: acute-onset vomiting, watery diarrhoea, cramps, nausea. Virus shed in stool even if asymptomatic. Numerous genotypes and unknown longevity of immunity ∴ repeat infection occurs. Diagnosis: clinical, stool sample reverse transcriptase PCR. Treatment: supportive, anti-motility agents, usually self-limiting.

**Rotavirus:** Double-stranded RNA virus. Wheel-like appearance on EM ∴ 'rota'. Commonest cause of gastroenteritis in children (~50%). Most infected by 5y. Presentation: incubation ~2d. Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3–8d, fever, abdominal pain. Diagnosis: clinical, antigen in stool. Treatment: supportive. Routine vaccination in UK (p407). Virus shed in stool post vaccine ∴ careful hygiene if immunosuppressed and changing nappies. Live vaccine ∴ delay vaccination if in utero biological agents with active transfer across placenta (eg infliximab, adalimumab).

**Enterotoxigenic E. coli:** Gram –ve anaerobe. Disease due to heat-stable or heat-labile toxin which stimulates Na+, Cl- and water efflux into gut lumen. ~20% of all infective diarrhoea, ~80% of traveller's diarrhoea. Presentation: incubation 1–3d. Watery diarrhoea, cramps. Lasts ~3–4d. Diagnosis: clinical, identification of toxin from stool culture. Treatment: supportive. See Traveller's diarrhoea p429.

**Clostridium perfringens (type A):** Gram +ve, anaerobe. Produces enterotoxin. Spores survive cooking and germinate during unrefrigerated storage. 2–30 outbreaks/yr in UK. Presentation: sudden-onset diarrhoea, cramps, usually lasts <24h. Diagnosis: stool toxin, quantification of faecal bacteria. Treatment: supportive. β-toxin of C. perfringens type C can cause a necrotizing enteritis with fulminant disease, pain, bloody diarrhoea, septic shock. β-toxin is sensitive to trypsin proteolysis so ↑ risk with trypsin inhibition by sweet potatoes, ascaris infection ∴ occurs in New Guinea ('pigbel'), central/south America, south-east Asia, China.

**Cholera:** Vibrio cholerae is a Gram –ve, aerobic, 'comma-shaped' flagellated motile vibrating/swarming rod. Found in faecally contaminated water. Serovars O1 and O139 cause disease. ~190 000 cases in 2014 (fig 9.36). Last indigenous case in UK in 1893. Presentation: incubation 2h–5d. ~75% asymptomatic but shed bacteria. Profuse (1L/h) diarrhoea ('rice-water' stool), vomiting, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, circulatory collapse, death. Diagnosis: Clinical: death due to dehydration from watery diarrhoea age >5y, or any watery diarrhoea age >5y during known epidemic. Identification of serovars O1 or O139 in stool. Rapid dipstick testing available but culture confirmation recommended. Treatment: oral rehydration salts (WHO/UNICEF ORS sachet) will treat up to 80%. Needs safe water. Adults may need 1L/hr initially: offer 100mL/5 min. NG if vomiting. IV fluids if severely dehydrated: Ringer's lactate or 0.9% saline plus ORS (beware ↑ K+) up to 200mL/kg in first 24h. Antibiotics in severe dehydration to ↓ diarrhoea: doxycycline (single dose 300mg) or tetracycline (3d course) guided by local susceptibility (azithromycin in children/pregnancy). Zinc shortens illness in children (10–20mg/24h). Prevention: cholera loves filth: clean water (and clean politics) abolishes it. Oral cholera vaccines (56–94% efficacy in adults) dependent on logistics, cost, production capacity. Antibiotic prophylaxis breeds resistance.
