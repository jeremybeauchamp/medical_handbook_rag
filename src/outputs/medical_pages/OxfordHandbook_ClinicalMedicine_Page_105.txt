The image appears to be a mostly blank page with minimal content. The only visible elements are:

1. The number "91" in the top right corner, likely indicating a page number.

2. An orange vertical bar on the right side of the page containing the text "History and examination" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. A small orange circle with a magnifying glass icon in the bottom right corner.

This seems to be a section divider or chapter introduction page for a section on "History and examination" in what is likely a medical or clinical document.
