# Prescribing NSAIDs: benefit vs risk profiling

Around 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID, but there is considerable variation in response and tolerance—if one isn't effective, try another. Mainly act as analgesics rather than modifying the disease process per se.

NSAIDs caused ~2000 UK deaths in 2011. Individualized risk: benefit analysis for each patient (including indication, dose, proposed duration of use, and comorbidity) is crucial and needs careful and experienced thought. Follow local recommendations and national guidelines where available.

## NSAID side effects:
The main serious side effects are GI bleeding (and ulcers and perforation), cardiovascular events (MI and stroke), and renal injury. The risks are dose related, starting with the first dose, so always aim to use the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time. Risks increase considerably with age, polypharmacy, history of peptic ulcers, and renal impairment.

## GI side effects:
NICE recommends co-prescription of PPI for any patient aged >45 years, and those with other risk factors for GI bleeding. Drug interactions can increase bleeding risks—avoid concomitant prescribing of anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, SSRI, spironolactone, steroids, and bisphosphonates. Coxibs are slightly lower risk than non-selective NSAIDs.

## Cardiovascular side effects:
NSAIDs—all are associated with a small increased risk of MI and stroke (independent of cardiovascular risk factor or duration of use). Risks are higher in those with concomitant IHD risk factors, eg diabetes and hypertension. Coxibs and diclofenac are higher risk, and are contraindicated if prior history of MI, PVD, stroke, or heart failure. Naproxen has the lowest cardiovascular risk. Low-dose celecoxib may be considered for patients on low-dose aspirin (if NSAID is required) as it does not interact with it.

## Renal risks:
Higher for patients already on diuretics, ACE, or ARB. Risks are also increased in the elderly, those with hypertension and T2DM. Overall, naproxen (<1000mg/day) or ibuprofen (<1200mg/day) plus PPI may be the safest options.

## Alternatives to NSAIDs:
Paracetamol, topical NSAIDs, opioids. Strengthening exercises may be more beneficial than mild oral analgesics.

## Counselling patients:
Make sure patients understand about the drugs they are taking: bleeding is more common in those who know less about their drugs.

- Only to take NSAIDs when they need them.
- Stop NSAIDs and seek urgent medical review if they develop abdominal pain or any symptoms of GI bleeding (eg report black stools ± faints immediately).
- Do not mix prescription NSAIDs with over-the-counter formulations: mixing NSAIDs can increase risks 20-fold.
- Smoking and alcohol increase risk profile of NSAIDs.
