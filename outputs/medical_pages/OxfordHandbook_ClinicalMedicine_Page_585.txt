# Sutures

Sutures are central to the art of surgery. No single suture fits the bill for every occasion, and so suture selection (including size) depends on the job in hand (see tables 13.2, 13.3). In their broadest sense they are absorbable or non-absorbable, synthetic or natural, and their structure may be divided into monofilament, twisted, or braided. Monofilament sutures are quite slippery but minimize infection and produce less reaction. Braided sutures have plaited strands and provide secure knots, but they may allow infection to occur in surrounding tissue between their strands. Twisted sutures have 2 twisted strands and similar qualities to braided sutures. Sizes are denoted according to a scale running down from #5 (heavy braided suture). Most common modern sutures are smaller than size #0, hence rising numbers with a -0 suffix correspond to progressively finer grades of suture up to 11-0 (fine ophthalmic monofilaments). 3-0 or 4-0 are the best sizes for skin closure. Timing of suture removal depends on site and the general health of the patient. Face and neck sutures may be removed after 5d (earlier in children), scalp and back of neck after 5d, abdominal incisions and proximal limbs (including clips) after ~10d, distal extremities after 14d. In patients with poor wound healing, eg steroids, malignancy, infection, cachexia (p35), the elderly, or smokers, sutures may need ~14d.

## Some commonly encountered suture materials

### Absorbable

Table 13.2 Absorbable suture materials

| Name      | Material       | Construction        | Use                                                        |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Monocryl® | Poliglecaprone | Monofilament        | Subcuticular skin closure                                  |
| PDS®      | Polydioxanone  | Monofilament        | Closing abdominal wall                                     |
| Vicryl®   | Polyglactin    | Braided multifilament| Tying pedicles; bowel anastomosis; subcutaneous closure    |
| Dexon®    | Polyglycolic acid | Braided multifilament | Very similar to Vicryl®                               |

### Non-absorbable

Table 13.3 Non-absorbable suture materials

| Name      | Material      | Construction         | Use                               |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Ethilon®  | Polyamide     | Monofilament         | Closing skin wounds               |
| Prolene®  | Polypropylene | Monofilament         | Arterial anastomosis              |
| Mersilk®N | Silk          | Braided multifilament| Securing drains                   |
| Metal     | Eg steel      | Clips or monofilament| Skin wound/sternotomy closure     |

N = natural; other natural materials (eg cotton and catgut) are rarely used these days.

## Surgical drains in the post-operative period

The decision when to insert and remove drains may seem to be one of the great surgical enigmas—but there are basically three types to get a grip of:

1. To drain the area of surgery and are often put under suction or -ve pressure (Redivac® uses a 'high vacuum'). These are removed when they stop draining. They protect against collection, haematoma, and seroma formation (in breast surgery this can cause overlying skin necrosis).

2. To protect sites where leakage may occur in post-operative period, eg bowel anastomoses. These form a tract and are removed after about 1wk.

3. To collect red blood cells from the site of the operation, which can then be autotransfused within 6h, protecting from the hazards of allotransfusion—it is used commonly in orthopaedics. (eg Bellovac®).

'Shortening a drain' means withdrawing it (eg by 2cm/d) to allow the tract to seal, bit by bit. ►Check the surgeon's wishes before altering a drain. ►If a drain 'falls out' on the ward, avoid re-siting it because it is now covered in skin flora. Put a collecting bag over the wound and contact surgical registrar.
