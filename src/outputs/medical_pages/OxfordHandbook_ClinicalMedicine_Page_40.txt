# Taking a history

Taking a good history is an art and an essential skill: 80% of diagnoses should be made on history alone, with the signs you elicit adding an extra 10% and tests only giving the final 5% or so. Do not rely on signs or investigations for your diagnosis, but use them rather to confirm what you suspected. Try to put the patient at ease: a good rapport may relieve distress. Introduce yourself and check whether the patient is comfortable. Be conversational rather than interrogative. Start with open questions, allow the patient to tell their story, but if they stray off topic, gently steer them back towards the important points.

## Presenting complaint (PC)
Open questions: 'Why have you come to see me today?' Record the patient's own words rather than medical terms.

## History of presenting complaint (HPC)
When did it start? What was the first thing noticed? Progress since then. Ever had it before? 'SOCRATES' questions: site; onset (gradual, sudden); character; radiation; associations (eg nausea, sweating); timing of pain/duration; exacerbating and alleviating factors; severity (eg scale of 1-10, compared with worst ever previous pain). Direct questioning (to narrow list of possible diagnoses). Specific or 'closed' questions about the differential diagnoses you have in mind (+risk factors, eg travel—p414) and a review of the relevant system.

## Past medical history (PMH)
Ever in hospital? Illnesses? Operations? Ask specifically about MIJTHREADS: MI, jaundice, TB, high BP, rheumatic fever, epilepsy, asthma, diabetes, stroke, anaesthetic problems.

## Drug history (DH)
Any tablets, injections, 'over-the-counter' drugs, herbal remedies, oral contraceptives? Ask about allergies and what the patient experienced, eg may be an intolerance (nausea, diarrhoea), or may have been a minor reaction of sensitization (eg rash and wheeze) before full-blown anaphylaxis.

## Social history (SH)
Probe without prying. 'Who else is there at home?' Job. Marital status. Spouse's job and health. Housing—any stairs at home? Who visits—relatives, neighbours, GP, nurse? Are there any dependants at home? Mobility—any walking aids needed? Who does the cooking and shopping? What can the patient not do because of the illness? Ask about occupation, hobbies, sport, exercise, and ethnic origin.

The social history is all too often seen as a dispensable adjunct but vital clues may be missed about the quality of life and it's too late to ask when the surgeon's hand is deep in the belly and they are wondering how radical a procedure to perform. Utilize the GP's knowledge of the patient: they may have known them and/or their family for decades. He or she may even hold a 'living will' or advance directive if they cannot speak for themselves. Tactfully ask about alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs. How much? How long? When stopped? 1 unit = 8g of ethanol = 1 spirits measure = 1/2 glass of wine = 1/3 pint of beer. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening test for alcoholism (p281). Quantify smoking in terms of pack-years: 20 cigarettes/day for 1 year equals 1 pack-year. We all like to present ourselves well, so be inclined to double stated quantities (Holt's 'law').

## Family history (FH)
Areas of the family history may need detailed questioning, eg to determine if there is a significant family history of heart disease you need to ask about the health of the patient's grandfathers and male siblings, smoking, tendency to hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and claudication before they were 60 years old, as well as ascertaining the cause of death. Ask about TB, diabetes, and other relevant diseases. Draw a family tree (see BOX). Be tactful when asking about a family history of malignancy.

## Systemic enquiry
(See p30.) Helps uncover undeclared symptoms. Some of this may already have been incorporated into the history.

> Always enquire, without sounding robotic, if your patient has any ideas of what the problem might be, if he/she has any particular concerns or expectations, and give him/her an opportunity to ask you questions or tell you anything you may have missed.

> Don't hesitate to review the history later: recollections change (as you will find, often on the post-take ward round when the Consultant is asking the questions!).
