# Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs): typical adult doses and side-effects

**Carbamazepine:** (As slow-release.) Initially 100mg/12h, increase by 200mg/d every 2wks up to max 1000mg/12h. SE: leucopenia, diplopia, blurred vision, impaired balance, drowsiness, mild generalized erythematous rash, SIADH (rare; see p673).

**Lamotrigine:** As monotherapy, initially 25mg/d, ↑ by 50mg/d every 2wks up to 100mg/12h (max 250mg/12h). ►Halve monotherapy dose if on valproate; double if on carbamazepine or phenytoin (max 350mg/12h). SE: maculopapular rash—occurs in 10% (but 1/1000 develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) typically in 1st 8wks, especially if on valproate; warn patients to see a doctor at once if rash or flu symptoms develop; Other SEs: diplopia, blurred vision, photosensitivity, tremor, agitation, vomiting, aplastic anaemia.

**Levetiracetam:** Initially 250mg/24h, increase by 250mg/12h every 2wks up to max 1.5g/12h (if eGFR >80). SE: psychiatric side-effects are common, eg depression, agitation. Other SEs: D&V, dyspepsia, drowsiness, diplopia, blood dyscrasias.

**Sodium valproate:** Initially 300mg/12h, increase by 100mg/12h every 3d up to max 30mg/kg (or 2.5g) daily. SE: teratogenic. Nausea is very common (take with food). Other SEs: liver failure (watch LFT especially during 1st 6 months), pancreatitis, hair loss (grows back curly), oedema, ataxia, tremor, thrombocytopenia, encephalopathy (hyperammonaemia).

**Phenytoin:** No longer 1st line due to toxicity (nystagmus, diplopia, tremor, dysarthria, ataxia) and SE: ↓intellect, depression, coarse facial features, acne, gum hypertrophy, polyneuropathy, blood dyscrasias. Blood levels required for dosage.

►Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are liver enzyme inducing.

## Epilepsy and pregnancy

Epilepsy carries a 5% risk of fetal abnormalities, so good seizure control prior to conception and during pregnancy is vital. Yet some anti-epileptics are teratogenic: the patient must be given accurate information and counselling about contraception, conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in order to make informed decisions. In particular:

- Advise women of child-bearing age to take folic acid 5mg/d.
- Strictly avoid sodium valproate and polytherapy prior to conception and during pregnancy (lamotrigine is preferred but transition needs to be planned).
- Advise that most AEDs except carbamazepine and valproate are present in breast milk. Lamotrigine is not thought to be harmful to infants.
- Discuss contraceptive methods, bearing in mind that: enzyme-inducing AEDs make progesterone-only contraception unreliable, and oestrogen-containing contraceptives lower lamotrigine levels—an increased dose may be needed to achieve seizure control.
