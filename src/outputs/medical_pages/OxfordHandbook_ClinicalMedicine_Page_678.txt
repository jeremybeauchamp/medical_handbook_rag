# Biochemistry—some major disease patterns

## Dehydration
↑Urea (disproportionate relative to smaller ↑ in creatinine),¹ ↑albumin (also useful to plot change in a patient's condition), ↑haematocrit (PCV); also ↓urine volume and ↓skin turgor.

## Abnormal kidney function
There are two major biochemical pictures (table 14.1):

**Low GFR:** Usually oliguric. Causes: early acute oliguric renal failure (p298), chronic kidney disease (p302). In chronic kidney disease also ↓Hb, ↑PTH, and renal bone disease.

**Tubular dysfunction:** Results from damage to tubules. Diagnosis is made by testing renal concentrating ability (p241). May be polyuric with ↑urinary glucose, amino acids, proteins (lysozyme, β₂-microglobulin), or phosphate. Causes: recovery from acute kidney injury, hypercalcaemia, hyperuricaemia, myeloma, pyelonephritis, hypokalaemia, Wilson's disease, galactosaemia, and heavy metal poisoning.

## Thiazide and loop diuretics
↓Na⁺, ↓K⁺, ↑HCO₃⁻, ↑urea.

## Bone disease
See table 14.2 for typical biochemical patterns.

| Hypoparathyroidism             | ↓                    | ↑       | Normal  |

## Hepatocellular disease
↑Bilirubin, ↑↑AST, ALP ↑ slightly, ↓albumin. Also ↑clotting times. For details of the differences between AST and ALT, see p291.

## Cholestasis
↑Bilirubin, ↑↑γGT, ↑↑ALP, ↑AST.

## Excess alcohol intake
Evidence of hepatocellular disease. Early evidence if ↑γGT, ↑MCV, and ethanol in blood before lunch.

## Myocardial infarction
↑Troponin, ↑CK, ↑AST, ↑LDH (p118).

## Addison's disease
↑K⁺, ↓Na⁺, ↑urea.

## Cushing's syndrome
May show ↓K⁺, ↑HCO₃⁻, ↑Na⁺.

## Conn's syndrome
May show ↓K⁺, ↑HCO₃⁻. Na⁺ normal or ↑. (Also hypertension.)

## Diabetes mellitus
↑Glucose, (↓HCO₃⁻ if acidotic).

## Diabetes insipidus
↑Na⁺, ↑plasma osmolality, ↓urine osmolality. (Both hypercalcaemia and hypokalaemia may cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.)

## Inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)
(See p673.) ↓Na⁺ with ↓↔ urea and creatinine, ↓plasma osmolality. ↑Urine osmolality (>plasma osmolality), ↑urine Na⁺ (>20mmol/L).

## Some immunodeficiency states
Normal serum albumin but low total protein (because immunoglobulins are missing. Also makes crossmatching difficult because expected haemagglutinins are absent; OHCS p198).

¹ Dehydration affects urea more than creatinine because in dehydration a greater proportion of filtered urea is reabsorbed by the kidney. Creatinine is hardly reabsorbed at all.
