# Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)

Spontaneous bleeding into the subarachnoid space, often catastrophic (table 10.7).

**Incidence** 9/100 000/yr; typical age: 35-65.

**Symptoms** Sudden-onset excruciating headache, typically occipital—like a 'thunderclap'. Vomiting, collapse, seizures, and coma often follow. Coma/drowsiness may last for days. Some patients report a preceding, 'sentinel' headache, perhaps due to a small warning leak from the offending aneurysm (~6%).

**Signs** Neck stiffness; Kernig's sign (takes 6h to develop); retinal, subhyaloid and vitreous bleeds (=Terson's syndrome; mortality ≈ 5). Focal neurology at presentation may suggest site of aneurysm (eg pupil changes indicating a IIIrd nerve palsy with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm) or intracerebral haematoma. Later deficits suggest complications (see later in topic).

**Causes**
- Berry aneurysm rupture (80%). Common sites: junctions of posterior communicating with the internal carotid (see fig 10.3, p451) or of the anterior communicating with the anterior cerebral artery, or bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (fig 10.17). 15% are multiple.
- Arterio-venous malformations (15%).
- Other causes: encephalitis, vasculitis, tumour (invading blood vessels), idiopathic.

**Risk factors** Previous aneurysmal SAH (new aneurysms form, old ones get bigger), smoking, alcohol misuse, ↑BP, bleeding disorders, SBE (mycotic aneurysm), family history (3-5x risk of SAH in close relatives). Polycystic kidneys, aortic coarctation, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p149) are all associated with berry aneurysms.

**Differentials** Meningitis (p822), migraine (p458), intracerebral bleed, cortical vein thrombosis (p480), dissection of a carotid or vertebral artery, benign thunderclap headache (triggered by Valsalva manoeuvre, eg cough, coitus).

**Tests**
- Urgent CT: Detects >95% of SAH within the 1st 24h (fig 10.18).
- Consider LP: If CT –ve but the history is very suggestive of SAH (and no CI: p768). This needs to be done >12h after headache onset to allow breakdown of RBCs so that a positive sample is xanthrochromic (yellow, due to bilirubin: differentiates between old blood from SAH vs a 'bloody tap').

**Management** Refer all proven SAH to neurosurgery immediately.
- Re-examine CNS often; chart BP, pupils, and GCS (p788). Repeat CT if deteriorating.
- Maintain cerebral perfusion by keeping well hydrated, but aim for SBP <160mmHg.
- Nimodipine (60mg/4h PO for 3wks, or 1mg/h IVI) is a Ca²⁺ antagonist that reduces vasospasm and consequent morbidity from cerebral ischaemia.
- Surgery: endovascular coiling vs surgical clipping (requiring craniotomy): the decision depends on the accessibility and size of the aneurysm, though coiling is preferred where possible (fewer complications, better outcomes). Do catheter or CT angiography to identify single vs multiple aneurysms before intervening. Newer techniques such as balloon remodelling and flow diversion can be helpful in anatomically challenging aneurysms.

**Complications** Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death, and occurs in 20%, often in the 1st few days. Cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm may cause a permanent CNS deficit, and is the commonest cause of morbidity. If this happens, surgery is not helpful at the time but may be so later. Hydrocephalus, due to blockage of arachnoid granulations, requires a ventricular or lumbar drain. Hyponatraemia is common but should not be managed with fluid restriction. Seek expert help.
