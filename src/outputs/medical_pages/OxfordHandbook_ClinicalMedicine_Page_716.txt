## Guillain-Barré syndrome (Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy)43,44 (table 15.2)

Incidence: 1-2/100,000/yr. Signs: A few weeks after an infection a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness starts. Triggers: Campylobacter jejuni, CMV, mycoplasma, zoster, HIV, EBV, vaccinations. The trigger causes antibodies which attack nerves. In 40%, no cause is found. It may advance quickly, affecting all limbs at once, and can lead to paralysis. There is a progressive phase of up to 4 weeks, followed by recovery. Unlike other neuropathies, proximal muscles are more affected, eg trunk, respiratory, and cranial nerves (esp. VII). Pain is common (eg back, limb) but sensory signs may be absent. Autonomic dysfunction: Sweating, pulse, BP changes, arrhythmias. Nerve conduction studies: Slow conduction. CSF: ↑Protein (eg >5.5g/L), normal CSF white cell count. Respiratory involvement (the big danger) requires transfer to ITU. Do forced vital capacity (FVC) 4-hourly. ►Ventilate sooner rather than later, eg if FVC <1.5L, PO2 <10kPa, PCO2 >6kPa. Rx: IV immunoglobulin 0.4g/kg/24h for 5d. Plasma exchange is good too (?more SE).45 Steroids have no role. Prognosis: Good; ~85% make a complete or near-complete recovery. 10% are unable to walk alone at 1yr. Complete paralysis is compatible with complete recovery. Mortality: 10%.

## Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) (fig 15.5)

A small vessel vasculitis, presenting with purpura (non-blanching purple papules due to intradermal bleeding), often over buttocks and extensor surfaces, typically affecting young ♂. There may be glomerulonephritis (p310), arthritis, and abdominal pain (± intussusception), which may mimic an 'acute abdomen'. Rx: Mostly supportive.

## Horner's syndrome

A triad of 1 miosis (pupil constriction, fig 15.4) 2 partial ptosis (drooping upper eyelid) + apparent enophthalmos (sunken eye) 3 anhidrosis (ipsilateral loss of sweating). Due to interruption of the face's sympathetic supply, eg at the brainstem (demyelination, vascular disease), cord (syringomyelia), thoracic outlet (Pancoast's tumour, p708), or on the sympathetic's trip on the internal carotid artery into the skull (fig 15.6), and orbit.

## Huntington's disease

Incurable, progressive, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder presenting in middle age, often with prodromal phase of mild symptoms (irritability, depression, incoordination). Progresses to chorea, dementia ± fits & death (within ~15yrs of diagnosis). Pathology: Atrophy and neuronal loss of striatum and cortex. Genetic basis: Expansion of CAG repeat on Chr. 4. Rx: (p87.) No treatment prevents progression. Counselling for patient and family.46

## Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome

Congenital, bilateral, autosomal recessive, sensorineural deafness, and long QT interval (p96, hence syncope, VT, torsades, ± sudden death—50% by age 15 if untreated). KCNQ1 or KCNE1 gene mutation causes K+ channelopathy. Rx: β-blocker, pacemaker, ICD, cochlear implants.47

## Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)

A spindle-cell tumour derived from capillary endothelial cells, caused by human herpes virus 8 (=Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus KSHV). It presents as purple papules (½–1cm) or plaques on skin (fig 15.7) and mucosa (look in mouth, but any organ). It metastasizes to nodes. There are four types: 1 Classic, a rare disease of the elderly. 2 Endemic, a disease of children documented prior to HIV. 3 Iatrogenic KS due to immunosuppression, eg organ transplant recipients. 4 AIDS-associated KS. Usually presents with low CD4 count and can indicate failure of HAART (p402). However ⅓ presents in HIV with near normal CD4 counts and an undetectable viral load. Initiation of HAART with rapid immune system constitution can precipitate KS. Lung KS may present in HIV +ve men and women as dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Bowel KS may cause nausea, abdominal pain. Rare sites: CNS, larynx, eye, glands, heart, breast, wounds, or biopsy sites. Δ: Biopsy. Rx: Optimize HAART, local radiotherapy, surgical excision, intralesional therapy (vincristine, bleomycin), topical retinoids, interferon alfa, interleukin-12. Current research includes thalidomide, VEGF monoclonal antibodies, and sirolimus.
