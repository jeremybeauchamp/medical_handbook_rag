## Signs

The following signs are not specific to a particular system:

### Cyanosis
Dusky blue skin (peripheral—of the fingers) or mucosae (central—of the tongue), representing 50g/L of Hb in its reduced (hence hypoxic) form; it occurs more readily in polycythaemia than anaemia.

Causes:
- Lung disease with inadequate oxygen transfer, eg luminal obstruction, asthma, COPD, pneumonia, PE, pulmonary oedema—may be correctable by ↑ inspired O₂.
- Congenital cyanotic heart disease, where there is a mixture, eg transposition of the great arteries or right-to-left shunt (eg VSD with Eisenmenger's syndrome; see p156)—cyanosis is not reversed by increasing inspired oxygen.
- Rare causes—methaemoglobinaemia, a congenital or acquired red cell disorder.

Acute cyanosis is an emergency. Is there asthma, an inhaled foreign body, a pneumothorax (p749, fig 1) or pulmonary oedema? See p814.

Peripheral cyanosis will occur in causes of central cyanosis, but may also be induced by changes in the peripheral and cutaneous vascular systems in patients with normal oxygen saturations. It occurs in the cold, in hypovolaemia, and in arterial disease, and is, therefore, not a specific sign.

### Pallor
May be racial or familial—or from anaemia, shock/faints, Stokes-Adams attack (p460, pale first, then flushing), hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism, and albinism.

Anaemia is haemoglobin concentration <130g/L in men and <120g/L in non-pregnant women (p324). It may be assessed from the conjunctivae and skin creases. Koilonychia and stomatitis (p32) suggest iron deficiency. Anaemia with jaundice suggests haemolysis. If pallor just one limb or digit, think of emboli.

### Skin discolouration
Generalized hyperpigmentation may be genetic (racial) or due to radiation; ↑ACTH (cross-reacts with melanin receptors, eg Addison's disease (p226), Nelson's syndrome (p76), ectopic ACTH in bronchial carcinoma); chronic kidney disease (urea, p302); malabsorption; chloasma (seen in pregnancy or with the oral contraceptive pill); biliary cirrhosis; haemochromatosis ('bronzed diabetes'); carotenaemia; or drugs (eg chlorpromazine, busulfan, amiodarone, gold).

### Obesity
Defined by the World Health Organization as a BMI of over 30kg/m². A higher waist to hip ratio, indicating central fat distribution, is commoner in ♂ and is associated with greater health risks, which include type 2 diabetes mellitus, IHD, dyslipidaemia, ↑BP, osteoarthritis of weight-bearing joints, and cancer (breast and bowel); see p206.

The majority of cases are not due to specific metabolic disorders. Lifestyle change is key to treatment, to increase energy expenditure and reduce intake (p244). Medication ± surgery may be considered if the patient fulfils strict criteria (BMI of 40 kg/m² or more, or between 35 kg/m² and 40 kg/m² and other significant disease that could improve with weight loss, non-surgical measures have been tried and failed, patient receives intensive management in a tier 3 service, and fit for anaesthesia and surgery). Conditions associated with obesity include: genetic (Prader-Willi syndrome, Lawrence-Moon syndrome), hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, and hypothalamic damage (eg tumour or trauma → damage to satiety regions).
