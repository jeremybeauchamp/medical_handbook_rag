Fig 6.24 It's easy to miss mild jaundice, especially under fluorescent light, so take your patient to the window, and as you both gaze at the sky, use the opportunity to broaden the horizons of your enquiries ... where have you been ... where are you going ...who are you with ... what are you taking ...? In the gaps, your patient may tell you the diagnosis—alcohol or drug abuse, sexual infections/hepatitis, or worries about the side-effects of their TB or HIV medication or a spreading cancer 'from this lump here which I haven't told anyone about yet'.

## The pathway of bilirubin metabolism

In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by hepatocytes, making it water-soluble. Conjugated bilirubin is secreted in bile and passes into the gut. Some is taken up again by the liver (via the enterohepatic circulation) and the rest is converted to urobilinogen by gut bacteria. Urobilinogen is either reabsorbed and excreted by the kidneys, or converted to stercobilin, which colours faeces brown.

Fig 6.25 Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of haemoglobin in a 3-step process: hepatic uptake, conjugation, and excretion.

## Causes of jaundice in a previously stable patient with cirrhosis

- Sepsis (esp. UTI, pneumonia, or peritonitis)
- Malignancy: eg hepatocellular carcinoma
- Alcohol; drugs (table 6.10)
- GI bleeding.

Signs of decompensation: Jaundice; ascites; UGI bleed; encephalopathy.

Table 6.10 Examples of drug-induced jaundice

| Condition   | Drugs |
|-------------|-------|
| Haemolysis  | • Antimalarials (eg dapsone) |
| Hepatitis   | • Paracetamol overdose (p844)<br>• Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide<br>• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors<br>• Flucloxacillin (may be weeks after ℞) | • Sodium valproate<br>• Halothane<br>• Statins<br>• Sulfonylureas |
| Cholestasis | • Fusidic acid, co-amoxiclav, nitrofurantoin<br>• Steroids (anabolic; the Pill) | • Prochlorperazine<br>• Chlorpromazine |

Fig 6.26 Amanita phalloides (Latin for 'phallic toadstool'; also known as the 'death cap') is a lethal cause of jaundice. It is the most toxic mushroom known. After ingestion (its benign appearance is confusing), amatoxins induce hepatic necrosis leaving few options other than transplantation.
