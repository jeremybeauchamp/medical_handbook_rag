## Bulbar and corticobulbar ('pseudobulbar') palsy

**Bulbar palsy** denotes diseases of the nuclei of cranial nerves IX–XII in the medulla.
*Signs:* An LMN lesion of the tongue and muscles of talking and swallowing: flaccid,
fasciculating tongue (like a sack of worms); jaw jerk is normal or absent, speech
is quiet, hoarse, or nasal. *Causes:* MND, Guillain–Barré, polio, myasthenia gravis,
syringobulbia (p516), brainstem tumours, central pontine myelinolysis (p672).

**Corticobulbar palsy** UMN lesion of muscles of swallowing and talking due to
bilateral lesions above the mid-pons, eg corticobulbar tracts (MS, MND, stroke, cen-
tral pontine myelinolysis). It is commoner than bulbar palsy. *Signs:* Slow tongue
movements, with slow deliberate speech; ↑jaw jerk; ↑pharyngeal and palatal re-
flexes; pseudobulbar affect (PBA)—weeping unprovoked by sorrow or mood-incon-
gruent giggling (emotional incontinence without mood change is also seen in MS,
Wilson's, and Parkinson's disease, dementia, nitrous oxide use, and head injury). In
some countries, dextromethorphan + quinidine is licensed for PBA.

### Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS

| Criteria | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Definite | Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 3 regions. |
| Probable | Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 2 regions. |
| Probable with lab support | Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region, or upper motor neuron signs in ≥1 region + EMG shows acute denervation in ≥2 limbs. |
| Possible | Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region. |
| Suspected | Upper or lower motor neuron signs only—in 1 or more regions. |

## Dignity and Dignitas

ALS is closely linked with frontotemporal dementia (FTD, p486) by increasing
clinical, genetic, and molecular evidence (nucleotide repeat expansions in gene
C9orf72 have been described in familial and sporadic ALS and in FTD). However, pa-
tients with MND often have no cognitive impairment in the early stages of the dis-
ease, and witness their inorexable physical decline with terrified awareness. For
this reason it is imperative to plan for the future early: discuss their wishes for
end-of-life care and in the eventuality of respiratory decline before it is too late
for wishes to be communicated. These discussions are crucial but not binding: the
patient can change their mind at any point, and also refuse any life-prolonging
treatment, knowing the consequence is death. However, in most countries, in-
cluding the UK, we cannot traverse that line that lies between management of
a supported death following withdrawal of life-prolonging (or death-prolonging)
interventions, and acting with the intention of causing death. Court battles en-
sue, with requests for assisted suicide that may frustrate and challenge ethicists,
physicians, politicians, and the judiciary, but above all, patients and their families.
Faced with such conflicting passions, perhaps our role is to be clear that we stand
beside our patients, come what may.
