# Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)

CLL is the commonest leukaemia (>25%; incidence: ~5/100000/yr). ♂:♀≈2:1. The hallmark is progressive accumulation of a malignant clone of functionally incompetent B cells. Mutations, trisomies, and deletions (eg del17p13) influence risk (table 8.8).

## Table 8.8 Staging and survival in CLL

| Rai stage: | Description | Median survival |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Lymphocytosis alone | >13yrs |
| I | Lymphocytosis + lymphadenopathy | 8yrs |
| II | Lymphocytosis + spleno- or hepatomegaly | 5yrs |
| III | Lymphocytosis + anaemia (Hb <110g/L) | 2yrs |
| IV | Lymphocytosis + platelets <100 × 10⁹/L | 1yr |

**Symptoms** Often none, presenting as a surprise finding on a routine FBC. Patients may be anaemic or infection-prone, or have weight, sweats, anorexia if severe.

**Signs** Enlarged, rubbery, non-tender nodes (fig 8.56). Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly.

**Tests** ↑Lymphocytes—may be marked (fig 8.57). Later: autoimmune haemolysis (p338), marrow infiltration: ↓Hb, neutrophils, platelets.

**Complications** 1 Autoimmune haemolysis. 2 ↑Infection due to hypogammaglobulinaemia (=↓IgG), bacterial, viral especially herpes zoster. 3 Marrow failure.

**Treatment** Consider drugs if symptomatic. Fludarabine + rituximab ± cyclophosphamide is 1st line (there is synergism). Ibrutinib, chlorambucil, bendamustine, and ofatumumab all have a role. Steroids help autoimmune haemolysis. Radiotherapy helps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Stem-cell transplantation may have a role in carefully selected patients. Supportive care: Transfusions, IV human immunoglobulin if recurrent infection.

**Natural history** ⅓ never progress (or even regress), ⅓ progress slowly, and ⅓ progress actively. CD23 and β2 microglobulin correlate with bulk of disease and rates of progression. Death is often due to infection or transformation to aggressive lymphoma (Richter's syndrome).
