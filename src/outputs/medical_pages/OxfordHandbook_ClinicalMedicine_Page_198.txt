# Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

## Definitions
COPD is a common progressive disorder characterized by airway obstruction (FEV1 <80% predicted; FEV1/FVC <0.7; see p162 and table 4.5) with little or no reversibility. It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Usually patients have either COPD or asthma, not both: COPD is favoured by:
- age of onset >35yrs
- smoking (passive or active) or pollution related
- chronic dyspnoea
- sputum production
- minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variation

Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as cough, sputum production on most days for 3 months of 2 successive yrs. Symptoms improve if they stop smoking. There is no excess mortality if lung function is normal. Emphysema is defined histologically as enlarged air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT.

## Prevalence
10-20% of the over-40s; 2.5×10⁶ deaths/yr worldwide.

## Pink puffers and blue bloaters
A traditional division but likely ends of a spectrum.
- Pink puffers: Have alveolar ventilation, a near normal PO2 and a normal or low PCO2. They are breathless but are not cyanosed. They may progress to type I respiratory failure (p188).
- Blue bloaters: Have alveolar ventilation, with a low PO2 and a high PCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on to develop cor pulmonale. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO2 and they rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory effort (p188)—supplemental oxygen should be given with care.

## Symptoms
Cough; sputum; dyspnoea; wheeze.

## Signs
Tachypnoea; use of accessory muscles of respiration; hyperinflation; ↓cricosternal distance (<3cm); ↓expansion; resonant or hyperresonant percussion note; quiet breath sounds (eg over bullae); wheeze; cyanosis; cor pulmonale.

## Complications
Acute exacerbations ± infection; polycythaemia; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale (oedema; ↑JVP); pneumothorax (ruptured bullae); lung carcinoma.

## Tests
- FBC: ↑PCV
- CXR: Hyperinflation; flat hemidiaphragms; large central pulmonary arteries; ↓peripheral vascular markings; bullae
- CT: Bronchial wall thickening; scarring; air space enlargement
- ECG: Right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy (cor pulmonale)
- ABG: ↓PO2 ± hypercapnia
- Spirometry (p162, p165): obstructive + air trapping (FEV1 <80% of predicted, FEV1:FVC ratio <70%, ↑TLC, ↑RV, ↓DLCO in emphysema—see p160). Learn how to do spirometry from an experienced person: ensure maximal expiration of the full breath (it takes >4s; it's not a quick puff out).

## Treatment
Chronic stable: see BOX and fig 4.14; Emergency: p812. Smoking cessation advice with cordial vigour (p93). Encourage exercise: BMI is often low; diet advice ± supplements may help (p584). Mucolytics (BNF 3.7) may help chronic productive cough (NICE). Disabilities may cause serious, treatable depression; screen for this (p15). Respiratory failure: p188. Oedema: diuretics. Flu and pneumococcal vaccinations: p167 and p396.

## Long-term O2 therapy (LTOT)
An MRC trial showed that if PO2 was maintained ≥8.0kPa for 15h a day, 3yr survival improved by 50%. UK NICE guidelines suggest LTOT should be given for:
1. Clinically stable non-smokers with PO2 <7.3kPa—despite maximal . These values should be stable on two occasions >3wks apart.
2. If PO2 7.3-8.0 and pulmonary hypertension (eg RVH; loud S2), or polycythaemia, or peripheral oedema, or nocturnal hypoxia.
3. O2 can also be prescribed for terminally ill patients.

## Severity assessment in COPD
Severity assessment has implications for therapy and prognosis. The BODE index (Body mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity) helps predict outcome and number and severity of exacerbations. The Global Initiative for COPD (GOLD) categorizes severity of COPD into four stages (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe) based on post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted, but it is not useful for predicting total mortality for 3 years of follow-up and onwards.
