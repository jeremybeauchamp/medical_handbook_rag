# Refeeding syndrome

This is a life-threatening metabolic complication of refeeding via any route after a prolonged period of starvation. At-risk patients include those initiating artificial feeding (enteral or parenteral) after prolonged starvation, or with malignancy, anorexia nervosa, or alcoholism. As the body turns to fat and protein metabolism in the starved state, there is a drop in the level of circulating insulin (because of the paucity of dietary carbohydrates). The catabolic state also depletes intracellular stores of phosphate, although serum levels may remain normal (0.85-1.45mmol/L). When refeeding begins, the level of insulin rises in response to the carbohydrate load, and one of the consequences is to increase cellular uptake of phosphate.

A hypophosphataemic state (<0.50mmol/L) normally develops within 4d and is mostly responsible for the features of 'refeeding syndrome', which include: rhabdomyolysis; red and white cell dysfunction; respiratory insufficiency; arrhythmias; cardiogenic shock; seizures; sudden death.

**Prevention** Give high-dose Pabrinex ® during re-feeding window. Identify at-risk patients, assess and monitor closely during refeeding (glucose, lipids, sodium, potassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc). Close involvement of a nutritionist is required.

**Treatment** is of the complicating features and includes parenteral phosphate administration (eg 18mmol/d) in addition to oral supplementation.

## The venous system at the thoracic outlet

When trying to judge the position of a central venous line tip on CXR (see fig 13.10) it helps to know the anatomical landmarks of the venous system (fig 13.9). The subclavian veins join the internal jugular veins behind the sternoclavicular joints to form the brachiocephalic veins. These come together behind the right 1st sternocostal joint to form the superior vena cava (SVC), which runs from this point to the right 3rd sternocostal joint. The right atrium starts here.

| Internal jugular veins | Vertebral veins | Subclavian vein |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Subclavian vein | Right brachiocephalic vein | Left superior intercostal vein |
| Superior vena cava | Azygos vein | Left brachiocephalic vein |

Fig 13.10 Right arm PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) still with a wire in the lumen. This is a radiograph at the time of insertion to determine if placement is correct. The tip lies in the SVC—ie good positioning for TPN or long-term antibiotic therapy. The tip of a Hickman line, for cytotoxic administration, is better in the right atrium, to avoid possible irritation of the SVC and consequent thrombosis or stenosis. NB: this image was acquired in the angiography room, where radio-opaque material appears black (it is easier to see contrast media against a white background). A similar effect may be achieved by digitally inverting a standard X-ray.
