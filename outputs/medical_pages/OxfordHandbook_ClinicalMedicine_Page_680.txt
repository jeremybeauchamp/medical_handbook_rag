# Fluid balance and IV fluid therapy

## Fluid requirement
Roughly 2-2.5L in a normal person (~70kg) over 24h. Normal daily losses are through urine (1500mL), stool (200mL), and insensible losses (800mL). This requirement is normally met through food (1000mL) and drink (1500mL).

## Intravenous fluids
Given if sufficient fluids cannot be given orally. About 2-2.5L of fluid containing roughly 70mmol Na+ and 70mmol K+ per 24h are required. Thus, a good regimen is 2-2.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20-30mmol of K+ per litre of fluid. Alternative routes are via a central venous line or subcutaneously. However, remember that all cannulae carry a risk of MRSA infection: femoral > jugular > subclavian > peripheral, so always resume oral fluid intake as soon as possible.

In a sick patient, don't forget to include additional sources of fluid loss when calculating daily fluid requirements, such as drains, fevers, or diarrhoea (see BOX 'Special cases'). Daily weighing helps to monitor overall fluid balance, as will fluid balance charts.

Examine patients regularly to assess fluid balance (see BOX 'Assessing fluid balance').

## Fluid compartments and types of IV fluid
For a 70kg man, total bodily fluid is ~42L (60% body weight). Of this, ⅔ is intracellular (28L) and ⅓ is extracellular (14L). Of the extracellular compartment, ⅓ is intravascular, ie blood (5L). Different types of IV fluid will equilibrate with the different fluid compartments depending on the osmotic content of the given fluid.

### 5% glucose:
(=Dextrose.) Isotonic, but contains only a small amount of glucose (50g/L) and so provides little energy (~10% daily energy per litre). The liver rapidly metabolizes all the glucose leaving only water, which rapidly equilibrates throughout all fluid compartments. It is, therefore, useless for fluid resuscitation (only 1/9 will remain in the intravascular space), but suitable for maintaining hydration. Excess 5% glucose IV may lead to water overload and hyponatraemia (p672).

### 0.9% saline:
('Normal saline.') Has about the same Na+ content as plasma (150mmol/L) and is isotonic with plasma. 0.9% saline will equilibrate rapidly throughout the extracellular compartment only, and takes longer to reach the intracellular compartment than 5% glucose. It is, therefore, appropriate for fluid resuscitation, as it will remain predominantly in the extracellular space (and thus ⅓ of the given volume in the intravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic saline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only.

### Colloids:
(eg Gelofusine®.) Have a high osmotic content similar to that of plasma and therefore remain in the intravascular space for longer than other fluids, making them appropriate for fluid resuscitation, but not for general hydration. Colloids are expensive, and may cause anaphylactic reactions. In reality, effective fluid resuscitation will use a combination of colloid and 0.9% saline.

### Hypertonic glucose (10% or 50%):
May be used in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. It is irritant to veins, so care in its use is needed. Infusion sites should be inspected regularly, and flushed with 0.9% saline after use.

### Glucose with sodium chloride:
(One-fifth 'normal saline.') Isotonic, containing 0.18% saline (30mmol/L of Na+) and 4% glucose (222mmol/L). It has roughly the quantity of Na+ required for normal fluid maintenance, when given 10-hourly in adults, but is now most commonly used in a paediatric setting.

### Hartmann's solution:
Contains Na+ 131mmol, Cl- 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K+ 5mmol, HCO3- 29mmol, and Ca2+ 2mmol per litre of fluid. It is an alternative to 0.9% saline, and some consider it more physiological.
