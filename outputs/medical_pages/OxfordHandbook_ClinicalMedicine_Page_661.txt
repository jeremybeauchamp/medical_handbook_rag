## Is asymptomatic non-visible haematuria significant?

Dipstick tests are often done routinely for patients on admission. If non-visible (previously microscopic) haematuria is found, but the patient has no related symptoms, what does this mean? Before rushing into a barrage of investigations, consider:

- One study found that incidence of urogenital disease (eg bladder cancer) was no higher in those with asymptomatic microhaematuria than in those without.
- Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria is the sole presenting feature in only 4% of bladder cancers, and there is no evidence that these are less advanced than malignancies presenting with macroscopic haematuria.
- When monitoring those with treated bladder cancer for recurrence, non-visible-haematuria tests have a sensitivity of only 31% in those with superficial bladder malignancy, in whom detection would be most useful.
- Although 80% of those with flank pain due to a renal stone have microscopic haematuria, so do 50% of those with flank pain but no stone.

The conclusion is not that urine dipstick testing is useless, but that results should not be interpreted in isolation. Unexplained non-visible haematuria in those >50yrs should be referred under the 2-week rule. Smokers and those with +ve family history for urothelial cancer may also be investigated differently from those with no risk factors. It is worth considering, that in a young, fit athlete, the diagnosis is more likely to be exercise-induced haematuria. Wise doctors work collaboratively with their patients. 'Shall we let sleeping dogs lie?' is a reasonable question for some patients.
