# Pharmacological treatment of cognitive decline

There is overlap between Lewy body dementia, AD, and Parkinson's disease (PD), complicating treatment decisions: L-dopa (p495) can precipitate delusions, and antipsychotic drugs worsen PD. Rivastigmine may help all three.

## Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors: 
Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are all modestly effective in treating AD and are recommended by NICE. There is also some evidence for their efficacy in the dementia of Parkinson's disease, and rivastigmine may improve behavioural symptoms in Lewy body dementia—though none should be used in mild disease and they should be discontinued if there is no worthwhile effect on symptoms. Doses:

- Donepezil: initially 5mg PO, eg doubled after 1 month.
- Rivastigmine: 1.5mg/12h initially, ↑ to 3–6mg/12h. Patches are also available.
- Galantamine: initially 4mg/12h, ↑ to 8–12mg/12h PO.

The cholinergic effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may exacerbate peptic ulcer disease and heart block. Ask about symptoms and do an ECG first.

## Antiglutamatergic treatment: 
Memantine (an NMDA antagonist, p449) is reasonably effective in late-stage AD, and is recommended in patients with severe disease or those with moderate disease in which AChE inhibitors are not tolerated/CI. Dose: 5mg/24h initially, ↑ by 5mg/d weekly to 10mg/12h. SE: hallucinations, confusion, hypertonia, hypersexuality.

## Antipsychotics: 
Consider in severe, non-cognitive symptoms only (eg psychosis or extreme agitation). Possible increased risk of stroke/TIA so discuss risks and assess cerebrovascular risk factors. Avoid in mild-to-moderate: Lewy body dementia (risk of neuroleptic sensitivity reactions), AD, and vascular dementia.

## Vitamin supplementation: 
Trials of dietary and vitamin supplements have been mixed and disappointing. Perhaps the best evidence exists for vitamin E (2000IU OD) which may confer a modest benefit in delaying functional progression in mild to moderate AD, but with no effect on cognitive performance.

# Genetics and the future

Possession of the APOE4 allele on chromosome 19 is the leading genetic cause of AD; homozygosity increases risk of developing the disease 12x. Yet while identifying this risk could enable a person to make lifestyle changes, there is little else to be done but anticipate one's impending cognitive decline (just one of the dilemmas raised by genetic testing). While the proteins that make up the plaques and neurofibrillary tangles seen in AD were identified in the early 1980s, progress has since been slow. So much so that in 2013, world leaders pledged to have a drug that would halt dementia within the next 10 years. Now a second-generation tau aggregation inhibitor called LMTX just might do the job, having shown success in phase III clinical trials in patients with mild/moderate AD, with clinical improvement and a slowing of atrophy on MRI. Perhaps in the imminent future, identifying those at greater risk of developing AD through genetic testing will have a role.
