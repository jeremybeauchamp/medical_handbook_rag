The image shows a mostly blank white page with minimal content. The key elements are:

1. The number "625" in the top right corner, likely indicating a page number.

2. A vertical red bar on the right side of the page containing the word "Surgery" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. A small red square icon with scissors in the bottom right corner, suggesting a surgical or medical context.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter start page for a section on Surgery in a larger document or textbook.
