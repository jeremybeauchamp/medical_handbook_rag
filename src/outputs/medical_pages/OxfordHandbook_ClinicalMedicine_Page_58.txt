# The heart sounds

Listen systematically: sounds then murmurs. While listening, palpate the carotid artery: S1 is synchronous with the upstroke.

Heart sounds See fig 2.13. The 1st and 2nd sounds are usually clear. Confident pronouncements about other sounds and soft murmurs may be difficult. Even senior colleagues disagree with one another about the more difficult sounds and murmurs.

## The 1st heart sound (S1)
Represents closure of mitral (M1) and tricuspid (T1) valves. Splitting in inspiration may be heard and is normal.

- Loud S1 in mitral stenosis, because the narrowed valve orifice limits ventricular filling, there is no gradual decrease in flow towards the end of diastole. The valves are, therefore, at their maximum excursion at the end of diastole, and so shut rapidly leading to a loud S1 (the 'tapping' apex). S1 is also loud if diastolic filling time is shortened, eg if the PR interval is short, and in tachycardia.
- Soft S1 occurs if the diastolic filling time is prolonged, eg prolonged PR interval, or if the mitral valve leaflets fail to close properly (ie mitral incompetence).

The intensity of S1 is variable in AV block, AF, and nodal or ventricular tachycardia.

## The 2nd heart sound (S2)
Represents aortic (A2) and pulmonary valve (P2) closure. The most important abnormality of A2 is softening in aortic stenosis.

- A2 is said to be loud in tachycardia, hypertension, and transposition, but this is probably not a useful clinical entity.
- P2 is loud in pulmonary hypertension and soft in pulmonary stenosis.
- Splitting of S2 in inspiration is normal and is mainly due to the variation of right heart venous return with respiration, delaying the pulmonary component.
  - Wide splitting occurs in right bundle branch block (BBB), pulmonary stenosis, deep inspiration, mitral regurgitation, and VSD.
  - Wide fixed splitting occurs in atrial septal defect (ASD).
  - Reversed splitting (ie A2 following P2, with splitting increasing on expiration) occurs in left bundle branch block, aortic stenosis, PDA (patent ductus arteriosus), and right ventricular pacing.
  - A single S2 occurs in Fallot's tetralogy, severe aortic or pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary atresia, Eisenmenger's syndrome (p156), large VSD, or hypertension.

NB: splitting and P2 are heard best in the pulmonary area.

## Additional sounds

### 3rd heart sound (S3)
May occur just after S2. It is low pitched and best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. S3 is pathological over the age of 30yrs. A loud S3 occurs in a dilated left ventricle with rapid ventricular filling (mitral regurgitation, VSD) or poor LV function (post MI, dilated cardiomyopathy). In constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy it occurs early and is more high pitched ('pericardial knock').

### 4th heart sound (S4)
Occurs just before S1. Always abnormal, it represents atrial contraction against a ventricle made stiff by any cause, eg aortic stenosis or hypertensive heart disease.

### Triple and gallop rhythms
A 3rd or 4th heart sound occurring with a sinus tachycardia may give the impression of galloping hooves. An S3 gallop has the same rhythm as 'Ken-tucky', whereas an S4 gallop has the same rhythm as 'Tenne-ssee'. When S3 and S4 occur in a tachycardia, eg with pulmonary embolism, they may summate and appear as a single sound, a summation gallop.

An ejection systolic click is heard early in systole with bicuspid aortic valves, and if ↑BP. The right heart equivalent lesions may also cause clicks.

Mid-systolic clicks occur in mitral valve prolapse (p144).

An opening snap precedes the mid-diastolic murmur of mitral (and tricuspid) stenosis. It indicates a pliable (non-calcified) valve.

Prosthetic sounds are caused by non-biological valves, on opening and closing: rumbling sounds ≈ ball and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards); single clicks ≈ tilting disc valve (eg single disc: Bjork Shiley; bileaflet: St Jude—often quieter). Prosthetic mitral valve clicks occur in time with S1, aortic valve clicks in time with S2.
