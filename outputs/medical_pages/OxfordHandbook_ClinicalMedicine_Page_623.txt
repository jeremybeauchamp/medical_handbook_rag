# Explaining the patterns of abdominal pain

Internal organs and the visceral peritoneum have no somatic innervation, so the brain attributes the visceral (splanchnic) signals to a physical location whose dermatome corresponds to the same entry level in the spinal cord. Importantly, there is no laterality to the visceral unmyelinated C-fibre pain signals, which enter the cord bilaterally and at multiple levels. Division of the gut according to embryological origin is the important determinant here: see table 13.11.

## Table 13.11 Somatic referral of abdominal pain

| Gut  | Division points                   | Somatic referral | Arterial supply      |
|------|-----------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Fore | Proximal to 2nd part of duodenum  | Epigastrium      | Coeliac axis         |
| Mid  | Above to ⅔ along transverse colon | Periumbilical    | Superior mesenteric  |
| Hind | Distal to above                   | Suprapubic       | Inferior mesenteric  |

Early inflammation irritates the structure and walls of the appendix, so a colicky pain is referred to the mid-abdomen—classically periumbilical. As the inflammation progresses and irritates the parietal peritoneum (especially on examination), the somatic, lateralized pain settles at McBurney's point, ⅔ of the way along from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine.

These principles also help us understand patterns of referred pain. In pneumonia, the T9 dermatome is shared by the lung and the abdomen. Also, irritation of the underside of the diaphragm (sensory innervation is from above through the phrenic nerve, C3–5) by an inflamed gallbladder or a subphrenic abscess refers pain to the right shoulder: dermatomes C3–5.

## Fig 13.27 Appendicectomy

The image shows three stages of an appendicectomy procedure:

1. Initial exposure of the appendix
2. Appendix mesentery and appendiceal artery ligated and divided
3. Ligate and bury appendix stump with a purse-string suture
