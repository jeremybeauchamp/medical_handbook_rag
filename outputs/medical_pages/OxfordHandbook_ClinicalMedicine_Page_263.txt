| Table 6.2 Indications for upper GI endoscopy | | 249 |
|-----------------------------------------------|------|
| Diagnostic indications | Therapeutic indications |
| Haematemesis/melaena | Treatment of bleeding lesions |
| Dysphagia | Variceal banding and sclerotherapy |
| Dyspepsia (≥55yrs old + alarm symptoms or treatment refractory, p252) | Argon plasma coagulation for suspected vascular abnormality |

| Table 6.3 Indications for colonoscopy | |
|---------------------------------------|---|
| Diagnostic indications | Therapeutic indications |
| Rectal bleeding—when settled, if acute | Haemostasis (eg by clipping vessel) |
| Iron-deficiency anaemia (bleeding cancer) | Bleeding angiodysplasia lesion (argon beamer photocoagulation) |
| Persistent diarrhoea | Colonic stent deployment (cancer) |
| Positive faecal occult blood test | Volvulus decompression (flexi sig) |
| Assessment or suspicion of IBD | Pseudo-obstruction    Polypectomy |
| Colon cancer surveillance | |

Fig 6.7 A big polyp seen on colonoscopy. An advantage of colonoscopy over barium enema is the ability to biopsy or intervene at the same time—in this case, polypectomy.

Fig 6.8 Colonoscopic image of an adenocarcinoma—p616. Compared with a colonic polyp (fig 6.7), the carcinoma is irregular in shape and colour, larger and more aggressive.

Fig 6.9 Angiodysplasia lesion seen at colonoscopy. Bleeding may be brisk. R: endoscopic obliteration. It is associated with aortic stenosis (Heyde's syndrome).²

Fig 6.10 Colonic mucosa in active UC (p262); it is red, inflamed, and friable (bleeds on touching). Signs of severity: mucopurulent exudate, mucosal ulceration ± spontaneous bleeding. If quiescent, there may only be a distorted or absent mucosal vascular pattern.

Fig 6.11 Colonoscopic image showing diverticulosis (p628). Navigating safely through the colon, avoiding the false lumina of the diverticula, can be a challenge. Don't go there if diverticula are inflamed (diverticulitis): perforation is a big risk. Other CI to colonoscopy: MI in last month; ischaemic colitis (Oxford Handbook of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Second Edition (Bloom et al.), p165).
