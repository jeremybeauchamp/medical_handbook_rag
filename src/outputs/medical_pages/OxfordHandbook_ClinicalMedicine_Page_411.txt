# Sailing the choppy waters of pandemic influenza

Pandemic influenza is the stormy sea of clinical medicine. Like sailors, we know there are deadly challenges to come, but we cannot predict their exact timing or nature. To prepare a boat for the tempestuous waters ahead, the mast is key; without it the sails are unsupported and progress will flounder. The mast of pandemic influenza is a tall, vertical spar which produces maximum drive through the swell, and allows sailors to climb up high to see what the horizon has in store. When preparing for pandemic influenza, we must make for ourselves a spar of principles and plans fit for the storm ahead:

- Surveillance, planning, and communication: worldwide influenza virological surveillance has been conducted through the WHO for >50yr. It offers a global alert mechanism for viruses with pandemic potential and defines methodologies for assessing antiviral susceptibility. Cooperation between international and national public health bodies is required for an understanding of clinical characteristics and disease spread. Communication to the individual (public and social media) is needed with advice about self-isolation, when and how to seek medical help, personal hygiene.

- Protect: vaccine development and production capacity (stockpiling), adequate personal protective equipment (apron, gloves, well-fitting mask), antiviral administration according to robust evidence and sensitivity.

- Animals: limiting/eliminating the animal reservoir of virus by culling, restricting animal movement, vaccination of livestock.

- Research: virus characteristics, disease severity predictors, epidemiological risk factors, antiviral development, targeting of treatment and vaccination, increased-spectrum vaccines with longer-lasting immunity, effective healthcare worker protection, evidence-based social distancing measures.

## Hide and seek

In 2009, there was justifiable global concern about a 'swine flu' pandemic. Based on a Cochrane review in 2008, which showed reduced complications with oseltamivir, billions were spent stockpiling the drug worldwide.

In fact, the positive conclusion was driven mainly by data from an industry-funded summary of 10 trials, of which only two had been published. Cochrane needed access to these missing data. The ensuing fight for information was to take 5 years. The offer of a secret contract, with secret terms, and secrecy about methods, was declined. These are not acceptable methods for meta-analysis. Inconsistencies began to arise in conclusions about effectiveness. Were people seeing different data, or was this simply a close call with two sides separated by a very small fence? Either way, being able to see all the data started to become increasingly important. But even the largest phase three trial of the drug had never been published. And was self-reported pneumonia a useful outcome measure? In December 2009, Cochrane could only declare that paucity of data undermined previous findings.

This battle for data became part of 'Alltrials': a campaign for transparency in clinical trials. ~50% of all clinical trials remain unpublished. The hunt goes on to find them. You can run your own drug trial, choose what to publish, and watch how the data become skewed at: www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias.

After half a decade, under ceaseless demand, and with the withholding of data become increasingly indefensible, the clinical study reports were released. These are normally used to provide authorities with a detailed trial report. They are not easy fodder for meta-analysis. Assessing 160,000 pages was uncharted territory for Cochrane. And the conclusion: oseltamivir shortens symptoms by <1d and hospitalization is not reduced. Other complications were unreliably reported.

The WHO includes oseltamivir on its WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th edition, 2015) which means it is considered efficacious, safe, cost-effective, and a minimum requirement for basic healthcare. Does this stand up to independent scrutiny? The evidence base is certainly tarnished. But a pandemic is not a RCT. And the threshold of evidence to reverse policy decisions may be different from the threshold needed to introduce them. If a new pandemic looms, millions more will be thrown in, for now.
