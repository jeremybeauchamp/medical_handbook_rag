Other conditions: UK DVLA states it must be informed if a driver suffers from medical conditions including:

- Epilepsy (the patient must have had at least two seizures in the last 5yrs). An epileptic patient who has suffered an epileptic attack while awake must not drive for 1yr from the date of the attack. Patients who have seizures that do not affect their consciousness (eg simple partial seizures) or seizures only during sleep may be allowed to drive. Being allowed to drive is conditional on the patient following medical advice and there not being reason to believe they are at high risk of further seizures.

- TIA or stroke. These patients should not drive for at least 1 month. There is no need to inform the DVLA unless there is residual neurological defect after 1 month, eg visual field defect. If TIAs have been recurrent and frequent, a 3-month period free of attacks may be required.

- Sudden attacks or disabling giddiness, fainting, or blackouts.

- Chronic neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's (any 'freezing' or on-off effects), and motor neuron diseases.

- Severe mental disorders; including serious memory problems and severe psychiatric illness. Those with dementia should only drive if the condition is mild (do not rely on armchair judgements: on-the-road trials are better). Encourage relatives to contact DVLA if a dementing relative should not be driving. GPs may desire to breach confidentiality (the GMC approves) and inform DVLA of demented or psychotic patients (tel. 01792 783686). Many elderly drivers (~1 in 3) who die in accidents are found to have Alzheimer's.

- A pacemaker, defibrillator, or antiventricular tachycardia device fitted.

- Diabetes controlled by insulin or tablets. The main issues which may result in driving bans are impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia and impaired vision.

- Angina while driving.

- Any type of brain surgery, brain tumour. Severe head injury involving inpatient treatment at hospital.

- Continuing/permanent difficulty in the use of arms or legs which affects ability to control a vehicle.

- Dependence on or misuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, or chemical substances in the past 3yrs (do not include drink/driving offences).

- Any visual disability which affects both eyes (do not declare short/long sight or colour blindness).

Vision (new drivers) should be 6/9 on Snellen's scale in the better eye and 6/12 on the Snellen scale in the other eye, wearing glasses or contact lenses if needed, and 3/60 in each eye without glasses or contact lenses.

The above-listed rules apply to standard licences only, for group 2 entitlement (eg HGV drivers) see www.dvla.gov.uk/medical/ataglance.aspx.
