# Hereditary cancer syndromes

A hereditary cancer⁴ is suggested by:
- unusual early age or presentation (eg male breast cancer)
- multiple primary cancers or bilateral/multifocal cancers
- clustering of cancers in relatives
- cancers in multiple generations
- rare tumours (eg retinoblastoma) or histology (medullary thyroid cancer, p223)
- ethnicity (eg Ashkenazi heritage and breast cancer).

Genetic testing is appropriate if the sensitivity and specificity of the test are good enough, and if the result of the test will impact diagnosis and management (see p27).

## Breast/ovarian cancer

~5-10% of breast cancers are due to mutations in BRCA1 (17q) or BRCA2 (13q).⁴⁵ Both genes function as tumour suppressors although they are dominant: a cancer phenotype can be seen when one copy of the gene is normal. A BRCA1 mutation confers a 55-65% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 39% risk of ovarian cancer. For BRCA2, the risk of breast cancer is 45% (6% in affected males), and 11% for ovarian cancer. Mutations are also linked to prostate, peritoneal, and pancreatic cancers. TP53 mutations (somatic >inherited) also confer a risk of breast cancer.

Refer if:
- 1st-degree relative with: breast cancer <40yrs, male breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer <50yrs
- 1st- and 2nd-degree relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer
- three 1st- or 2nd-degree relatives with breast cancer
- risk assessment calculation of >3% risk in 10yrs or lifetime risk ≥17%
- other: Ashkenazi ancestry, sarcoma <45yrs, multiple cancers at a young age.

Genetic counselling and testing for BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 mutations is offered if calculated risk of mutation is >10%. If known BRCA1/2 mutation, offer women annual MRI 30-49yrs and annual mammograpy 50-69yrs (MRI 20-69yrs if TP53 mutation). Prophylactic tamoxifen or raloxifene may be appropriate depending on tolerance and VTE/endometrial cancer risk. Surgical management (mastectomy/oophorectomy) should only be via a specialist MDT.

## Colorectal cancer

~25% have a family history. ~5% have identified mutations. Refer to specialist genetic service if: two 1st-degree relatives with colorectal cancer at average age <60yrs, or if criteria for an autosomal dominant colorectal cancer syndrome is met:

- Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)): 1-3% of colorectal cancer. Autosomal dominant due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer up to ~80%. Increased risk of other 'Lynch cancers': endometrium, ovary, urinary tract, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract. Suspect if ≥3 affected relatives (one 1st-degree), from two successive generations, of whom one was affected <50yrs old. Colonoscopic surveillance (at least biennial) from 25-75yrs.

- Familial adenomatous polyposis: Due to mutations in the APC tumour suppressor gene (5q) (fig 11.2). <1% of colorectal cancer. Causes multiple colorectal adenomas (>100 in classical disease) which undergo malignant transformation. Gene penetrance approaches 100% by 50yrs. Surveillance sigmoidoscopy from 12yrs, with prophylactic surgery usually <25yrs guided by polyp number, size, and dysplasia.

- Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: 1 in 25,000-280,000. Hamartomatous polpys. 10-20% risk of colorectal cancer, ~50-60% risk of GI cancer, ~60% risk of breast cancer. Due to germline mutations in STK11, a tumour suppressor gene (19p14). Surveillance in all (see p708).

## Prostate cancer

5-10% (~50% disease <55yrs) estimated to be due to inherited factors. Genes include BRCA1, BRCA2, mismatch repair, and HOXB13 which interacts with androgen receptor. Age and race contribute. See p530 for screening.

## Other familial cancer syndromes

Von Hippel-Lindau (p320, p712), Carney complex (p223), MEN (p223), neurofibromatosis (p514).
