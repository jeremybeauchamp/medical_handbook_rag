ECG tracings showing various cardiac arrhythmias

Fig 3.29 VF (p894).

ECG tracing of ventricular fibrillation

Fig 3.30 VT with a rate of 235/min.

ECG tracing of ventricular tachycardia

Fig 3.31 Torsade de pointes tachycardia.

ECG tracing of Torsade de pointes

Fig 3.32 A fusion beat (*)—a 'normal beat' fuses with a VT complex creating an unusual complex.

Fig 3.33 A capture beat (*)—a normal QRS amongst runs of VT. This would not be expected if the QRS breadth were down to bundle branch block or metabolic causes.

Fig 3.34 Bigeminy—a normal QRS is followed by a ventricular ectopic beat * then a compensatory pause, this pattern then repeats. The ectopic beats have the same morphology as each other so probably all share an origin.
