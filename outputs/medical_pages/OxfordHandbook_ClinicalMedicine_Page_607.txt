The image shows a mostly blank white page with minimal content. The key elements are:

1. The number "593" in the top right corner, likely indicating a page number.

2. The word "Surgery" written vertically along the right edge of the page in red.

3. A small icon of scissors in the bottom right corner, also in red.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter title page for a section on Surgery in a larger document or textbook.
