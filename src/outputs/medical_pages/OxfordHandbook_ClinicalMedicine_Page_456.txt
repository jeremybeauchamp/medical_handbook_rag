## Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)

This chapter gives guidance on hundreds of pyrexia-causing infections; but what should you do if your patient has a fever that you cannot explain? Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)24 has a differential of >200 diseases. 15-30% of these patients will eventually be given an infective diagnosis (depending on your corner of the globe). ~20% will remain undiagnosed, but in most of these the fever will resolve within 4wks.

### Diagnostic criteria
Pyrexia >3wks with no identified cause after evaluation in hospital for 3d or ≥3 out-patient visits.

Fever may also be undiagnosed in specific subgroups despite appropriate evaluation for 3d, including negative cultures at ≥ 2 days:
- Nosocomial PUO: Patient hospitalized for >48h with no infection at admission.
- Immunodeficient PUO: Pyrexia in patient with <500 neutrophils/microlitre.
- HIV PUO: Pyrexia in HIV infection lasting 3d as an in-patient or >4wks as an outpatient.

### History
Most PUO are due to common diseases with atypical presentation. Consider all details as potentially relevant. Include: travel (p414), diet, animal contact, changes in medication, recreational drug use, obstetric/sexual history, family history (table 9.30).

### Examination
Confirm fever. Pattern of fever is rarely helpful (contrary to the textbooks, most malaria has no specific pattern). Do not forget: mouth, genitals, skin, thyroid, lymphatic system, eyes including retina, temporal arteries (table 9.30).

### Investigation
- Extent of investigation depends on immune status and how well the patient is.
- Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, electrophoresis, LDH, CK, ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor, HIV test, malaria smear, interferon-gamma release assay for TB (p394).
- Microscopy and culture: Blood ×3, urine, sputum (including AFB), stool, CSF.
- Imaging: CXR, abdominal/pelvic USS, venous Doppler. Consider: CT(PA), MRI, echo (TOE). Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) highlights areas of glucose uptake including tumour and inflammation. It may aid/direct diagnosis in up to 50% of PUO.
- Other: Hepatitis serology, CMV, EBV, autoimmune screen, cryoglobulins, toxoplasmosis, brucellosis, Coxiella, lymph node biopsy, endoscopy, temporal artery biopsy.
