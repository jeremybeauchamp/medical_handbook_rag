Fig 16.37 Renal artery digital subtraction angiogram (DSA; DSA is the final arbiter of renal artery stenosis). It is possible to tell that this is a DSA as no other structure has any definition or contrast in the image. There is, however, some interference from overlying bowel gas, which is not an uncommon problem. GI tract peristalsis can be diminished during the examination by using IV buscopan.

Fig 16.38 Coronal 3D MRA of the kidneys showing two renal arteries supplying the left kidney. This is important information pre-transplant. Anomalous renal arteries are common and, like the normal renal arteries, are end arteries, hence the consequence of infarction if tied at surgery.
