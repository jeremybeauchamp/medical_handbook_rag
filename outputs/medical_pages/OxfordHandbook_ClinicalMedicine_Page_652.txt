# Urinary tract calculi (nephrolithiasis)

Renal stones (calculi) consist of crystal aggregates. Stones form in collecting ducts and may be deposited anywhere from the renal pelvis to the urethra, though classically at: 1 Pelviureteric junction 2 Pelvic brim 3 Vesicoureteric junction.

**Prevalence** Common: lifetime incidence up to 15%. Peak age: 20-40yr. ♂:♀≈3:1.

**Types** •Calcium oxalate (75%). •Magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite/triple phosphate; 15%). •Also: urate (5%), hydroxyapatite (5%), brushite, cystine (1%), mixed.

**Presentation** Asymptomatic or: 1 Pain: Excruciating spasms of renal colic 'loin to groin' (or genitals/inner thigh), with nausea/vomiting. Often cannot lie still (differentiates from peritonitis). Obstruction of kidney: felt in the loin between rib 12 and lateral edge of lumbar muscles (like intercostal nerve irritation pain; the latter is not colicky, and is worsened by specific movements/pressure on a trigger spot). Obstruction of mid-ureter: may mimic appendicitis/diverticulitis. Obstruction of lower ureter: may lead to symptoms of bladder irritability and pain in scrotum, penile tip, or labia majora. Obstruction in bladder or urethra: causes pelvic pain, dysuria, strangury (desire but inability to void) ± interrupted flow. 2 Infection: Can coexist (risk if voiding impaired), eg UTI; pyelonephritis (fever, rigors, loin pain, nausea, vomiting); pyonephrosis (infected hydronephrosis) 3 Haematuria. 4 Proteinuria. 5 Sterile pyuria. 6 Anuria.

**Examination** Usually no tenderness on palpation. May be renal angle tenderness especially to percussion if there is retroperitoneal inflammation.

**Tests** FBC, U&E, Ca²⁺, PO₄³⁻, glucose, bicarbonate, urate. Urine dipstick: Usually +ve for blood (90%). MSU: MC&S. Further tests for cause: Urine pH; 24h urine for: calcium, oxalate, urate, citrate, sodium, creatinine; stone biochemistry (sieve urine & send stone).

**Imaging:** Non-contrast CT is investigation of choice for imaging stones (99% visible) & helps exclude differential causes of an acute abdomen. ►A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm may present similarly. 80% of stones are visible on KUB XR (kidneys + ureters + bladder). Look along ureters for calcification over the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies. US an alternative for hydronephrosis or hydroureter.

**Ⓡ Initially:** Analgesia, eg diclofenac 75mg IV/IM, or 100mg PR. (If CI: opioids) + IV fluids if unable to tolerate PO; antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV, or gentamicin) if infection. Stones <5mm in lower ureter: ~90-95% pass spontaneously. ↑Fluid intake. Stones >5mm/pain not resolving: Medical expulsive therapy: ►start at presentation; nifedipine 10mg/8h PO or α-blockers (tamsulosin 0.4mg/d) promote expulsion and reduce analgesia requirements. Most pass within 48h (>80% after ~30d). If not, try extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) (if <1cm), or ureteroscopy using a basket. ESWL: US waves shatter stone. SE: renal injury, may also cause ↑BP and DM. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): keyhole surgery to remove stones, when large, multiple, or complex. Open surgery is rare.

►**Indications for urgent intervention (delay kills glomeruli):** Presence of infection and obstruction—a percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric stent may be needed to relieve obstruction (p640); urosepsis; intractable pain or vomiting; impending AKI; obstruction in a solitary kidney; bilateral obstructing stones.

**Prevention** General: Drink plenty. Normal dietary Ca²⁺ intake (low Ca²⁺ diets increase oxalate excretion). Specifically: •Calcium stones: in hypercalciuria, a thiazide diuretic is used to ↓Ca²⁺ excretion. •Oxalate: ↓oxalate intake; pyridoxine may be used (p295). •Struvite (phosphate mineral): treat infection promptly. •Urate: allopurinol (100-300mg/24h PO). Urine alkalinization may also help, as urate is more soluble at pH>6 (eg with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate). •Cystine: vigorous hydration to keep urine output >3L/d and urinary alkalinization (as above-mentioned). Penicillamine is used to chelate cystine, given with pyridoxine to prevent vitamin B₆ deficiency.
