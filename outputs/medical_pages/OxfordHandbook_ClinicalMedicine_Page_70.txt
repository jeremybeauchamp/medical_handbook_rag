## The gastrointestinal system: history

See table 2.9 for direct questions to ask regarding presenting symptoms.

### Table 2.9 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask

| Presenting symptoms | Direct questions |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Abdominal pain (see p57 and p606) | SOCRATES (p36) |
| Distension (see p57) | |
| Nausea, vomiting (see table 2.10) | Timing? Relation to meals? Amount? Content (liquid, solid, bile, blood)? Frequency? Fresh (bright red)/dark/'coffee grounds'? Consider neoplasia (weight loss, dysphagia, pain, melaena?), NSAIDs/warfarin? Surgery? Smoking? |
| Haematemesis (pp256-7) | |
| Dysphagia (p250) | Level? Onset? Intermittent? Progressive? Painful swallow (odynophagia)? |
| Indigestion/dyspepsia/reflux (p252) | Timing (relation to meals)? |
| Recent change in bowel habit | Consider neoplasia (weight loss, dysphagia, pain, melaena?) |
| Diarrhoea (p258), constipation (p260) | |
| Rectal bleeding (p629) or melaena (p246) | Pain on defecation? Mucus? Fresh/dark/black? Mixed with stool/on surface/on paper/in the pan? |
| Appetite, weight change | Intentional? Quantify. Dysphagia? Pain? |
| Jaundice (p272) | Pruritus? Dark urine? Pale stools? |

**Past history** Peptic ulcer disease, carcinoma, jaundice, hepatitis, blood transfusions, tattoos, previous operations, last menstrual period (LMP), dietary changes.

**Drug history** Especially steroids, NSAIDs, antibiotics, anticoagulants (eg clopidogrel with SSRI—see BOX 'SSRIs and upper GI bleeding risk').

**Family history** Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), peptic ulcer disease, polyps, cancer, jaundice.

**Social history** Smoking, alcohol (quantify units/week), recreational drug use, travel history, tropical illnesses, contact with jaundiced persons, occupational exposures, sexual history, blood transfusions, surgery over-seas.

**Vomiting** History is vital. Associated symptoms and past medical history often indicate cause (table 2.10). Examine for dehydration, distension, tenderness, abdominal mass, succussion splash in children (pyloric stenosis), or tinkling bowel sounds (intestinal obstruction).
