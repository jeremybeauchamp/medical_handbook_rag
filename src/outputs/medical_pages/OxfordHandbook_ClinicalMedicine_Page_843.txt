    A[ABC]
    B[Oxygen if saturations <92% or hypoxic on ABG<br>Intubate and hyperventilate if necessary<br>Immobilize neck until injury to cervical spine excluded]
    C[Stop blood loss and support circulation<br>Treat for shock if required (p790)]
    D[Treat seizures with lorazepam ± phenytoin (p826)]
    E[Assess level of consciousness (GCS):<br>If GCS ≤8 ICU involvement to manage airway<br>Assess for anterograde and retrograde amnesia]
    F[Rapid examination survey]
    G[Investigations:<br>U&Es, glucose, FBC, blood alcohol,<br>toxicology screen, ABGs, and clotting]
    H[Neurological examination]
    I[Brief history:<br>When? Where? How? Had a fit? Lucid interval? Alcohol?]
    J[Evaluate lacerations of face or scalp:<br>Palpate deep wounds with sterile glove to check for<br>step deformity. Note obvious skull/facial fractures]
    K[Check for CSF leak, from nose (rhinorrhoea) or ear (otorrhoea)<br>Any blood behind the ear drum?<br>If either is present, suspect basilar skull fracture: do CT<br>Give tetanus toxoid, and refer at once to neurosurgeons]
    L[Palpate the neck posteriorly for tenderness and deformity:<br>If detected, or if the patient has other indicators for neck imaging, im-<br>mobilize the neck and get cervical spine X-ray or CT neck (see text)]
    M[Radiology:<br>As indicated: CT of head/neck (see text)<br>Consider need for trauma series (eg CT chest/abdo/pelvis)]
