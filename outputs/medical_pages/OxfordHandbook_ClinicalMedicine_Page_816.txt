## Cardiogenic shock

This has a high mortality and is very difficult to treat. Ask a senior physician's help both in formulating an exact diagnosis and in guiding treatment.

Cardiogenic shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion primarily due to cardiac dysfunction. It may occur suddenly, or after progressively worsening heart failure.

### Causes
- Myocardial infarction (pp796-9).
- Arrhythmias (pp124-31).
- Pulmonary embolus (p818).
- Tension pneumothorax (p814).
- Cardiac tamponade (p154 and later in topic).
- Myocarditis; myocardial depression (drugs, hypoxia, acidosis, sepsis) (p152).
- Valve destruction (endocarditis—p150).
- Aortic dissection (p655).

### Management
See fig 19.8.
- If the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital (see p796).
- Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU.
- Investigation and treatment may need to be done concurrently.
- Investigations: ECG, U&E, troponin, ABG, CXR, echocardiogram. If indicated, CT thorax (speak with radiologists, this can be protocolled for both aortic dissection and PE).
- Monitor: CVP, BP, ABG, ECG, urine output. Keep on cardiac monitor/telemetry. Record a 12-lead ECG every hour until the diagnosis is made. Consider a CVP line and an arterial line to monitor pressure, if these are in situ consider measuring cardiac output and volume status.³ Catheterize for accurate urine output.

### Cardiac tamponade
Pericardial fluid collects → intrapericardial pressure rises → heart cannot fill → pumping stops.

Causes: Trauma, lung/breast cancer, pericarditis, myocardial infarct, bacteria, eg TB. Rarely: urea, radiation, myxoedema, dissecting aorta, SLE. Also coronary artery dissection (secondary to PCI) and/or ruptured ventricle.

Signs: ↓BP, ↑JVP, and muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad); ↑JVP on inspiration (Kussmaul's sign); pulsus paradoxus (pulse fades on inspiration). Echocardiography may be diagnostic. CXR: globular heart; left heart border convex or straight; right cardiophrenic angle <90°. ECG: electrical alternans (p154).

Management: This can be very difficult. Everything is against you: time, physiology, and your own confidence, as the patient may be too ill to give a history, and signs may be equivocal—but bitter experience has taught us not to equivocate for long. Request the presence of your senior at the bedside (do not make do with telephone advice). With luck, prompt pericardiocentesis (p773) brings swift relief. While awaiting this, give O₂, monitor ECG, and set up IVI. Take blood for group & save. NB: there may be a role for cardiothoracic surgery (eg CABG, ventricular repair, or pericardial window) as a definitive solution to some causes.

³ Eg Pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO) or lithium dilution cardiac output (LIDCO). Both use injection (PICCO = cold water, LIDCO = lithium) to estimate filling pressure, extravascular water (ie pulmonary oedema) and cardiac output. The time from injection via a central vein to detection via an arterial line, plus dilution, gives estimates of cardiac output and volume status and can guide fluid and inotrope therapy.
