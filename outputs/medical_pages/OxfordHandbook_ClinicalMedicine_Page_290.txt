# Cirrhosis

Cirrhosis (Greek kirrhos = yellow) implies irreversible liver damage. Histologically, there is loss of normal hepatic architecture with bridging fibrosis and nodular regeneration.

## Causes
Most often chronic alcohol abuse, HBV, or HCV infection. Others: see BOX 'Causes of cirrhosis'.

## Signs
Leuconychia: white nails with lunulae undemarcated, from hypo-albuminaemia; Terry's nails—white proximally but distal ⅓ reddened by telangi-ectasias; clubbing; palmar erythema; hyperdynamic circulation; Dupuytren's contracture; spider naevi (fig 6.27); xanthelasma; gynaecomastia; atrophic testes; loss of body hair; parotid enlargement (alcohol); hepatomegaly, or small liver in late disease; ascites; splenomegaly.

## Complications
### Hepatic failure:
Coagulopathy (failure of hepatic synthesis of clotting factors); encephalopathy (p259); hypoalbuminaemia (oedema); sepsis (pneumonia; septicaemia); spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP); hypoglycaemia.

### Portal hypertension:
Ascites (fig 6.28); splenomegaly; portosystemic shunt including oesophageal varices (± life-threatening upper GI bleed) and caput medusae (enlarged superficial periumbilical veins). HCC: ↑risk.

## Tests
### Blood:
LFT: ↑ or ↑bilirubin, ↑AST, ↑ALT, ↑ALP, ↑γGT. Later, with loss of synthetic function, look for ↓albumin ± ↑PT/INR. ↓WCC & ↓platelets indicate hypersplenism.

### Find the cause:
ferritin, iron/total iron-binding capacity (p288); hepatitis serology (p278); immunoglobulins (p290); autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, SMA, p553); α-feto protein (p286); caeruloplasmin in patients <40yrs old (p285); α1-antitrypsin (p290).

### Liver ultrasound + duplex:
May show a small liver or hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, focal liver lesion(s), hepatic vein thrombus, reversed flow in the portal vein, or ascites.

### MRI:
↑Caudate lobe size, smaller islands of regenerating nodules, and the presence of the right posterior hepatic notch are more frequent in alcoholic cirrhosis than in virus-induced cirrhosis.

### Ascitic tap:
Should be performed and fluid sent for urgent MC&S—neutrophils >250/mm³ indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (see later in topic for treatment).

### Liver biopsy:
(See p248.) Confirms the clinical diagnosis.

## Management
### General:
Good nutrition is vital. Alcohol abstinence (p280). Avoid NSAIDs, sedatives, and opiates. Colestyramine helps pruritus (4g/12h PO, 1h after other drugs). Consider ultrasound ± α-fetoprotein every 6 months to screen for HCC (p286) in those where this information will change management.

### Specific:
For hepatitis-induced cirrhosis see p278. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in PBC (p282) may improve LFT and improve transplant-free survival. Penicillamine for Wilson's disease (p285).

### Ascites:
Fluid restriction (<1.5L/d), low-salt diet (40–100mmol/d). Give spironolactone 100mg/24h PO; ↑dose as tolerated (max 400mg/24h)—it counters deranged renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) axis. Chart daily weight and aim for weight loss of ≤½kg/d. If response is poor, add furosemide ≤120mg/24h PO; do U&E (watch Na+) often. Therapeutic paracentesis with concomitant albumin infusion (6–8g/L fluid removed) may be required.

### Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP):
Must be considered in any patient with ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may be asymptomatic). Common organisms are E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci. Rx: eg piperacillin with tazobactam 4.5g/8h for 5d or until sensitivities known. Give prophylaxis for high-risk patients (↓albumin, ↑PT/INR, low ascitic albumin) or those who have had a previous episode: eg ciprofloxacin 500mg PO daily.

### Encephalopathy:
Recurrent episodes may be reduced in frequency with prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin (p274).

### Renal failure:
↓hepatic clearance of immune complexes leads to trapping in kidneys (∴ IgA nephropathy ± hepatic glomerulosclerosis). See also p275 for hepato-renal syndrome.

## Prognosis
Overall 5yr survival is ~50%. Poor prognostic indicators: encephalopathy; serum Na+ <110mmol/L; serum albumin <25g/L; ↑INR.

## Liver transplantation
is the only definitive treatment for cirrhosis (p277).

### Acute indications:
Acute liver failure meeting King's College criteria (see BOX 'King's College Hospital criteria in acute liver failure' p275)

### Chronic indications:
Advanced cirrhosis of any cause; hepatocellular cancer (1 nodule <5cm or ≤5 nodules <3cm).
