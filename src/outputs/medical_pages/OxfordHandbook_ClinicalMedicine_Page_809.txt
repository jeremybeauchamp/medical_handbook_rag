Fig 19.4 Management of anaphylaxis.

Adrenaline (=epinephrine) is given IM and NOT IV unless the patient is severely ill, or has no pulse. The IV dose is different: 100mcg/min—titrating with the response. This is 0.5mL of 1:10 000 solution IV per minute. Stop as soon as a response has been obtained.

If on a β-blocker, consider salbutamol IV in place of adrenaline.
