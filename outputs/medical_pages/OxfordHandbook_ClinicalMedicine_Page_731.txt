## Epilogue

25% of patients with rare diseases have to wait from 5-30 years for a diagnosis. 40% are misdiagnosed resulting in inappropriate drugs or psychological treatmentsâ€”eg 20% of people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (p149) had to consult over 20 doctors before the diagnosis was made,70 causing understandable loss of confidence in our profession. Lack of appropriate referral and rejection because of disease complexity are common problems. Let us cultivate our networks with each other and approach 'unexplained symptoms' with an open mind.
