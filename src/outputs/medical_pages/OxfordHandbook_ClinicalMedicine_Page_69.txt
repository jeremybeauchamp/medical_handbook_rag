## Chest deformities

- **Barrel chest:** ↑AP diameter, tracheal descent and chest expansion ↓, seen in chronic hyperinflation (eg asthma/COPD).
- **Pigeon chest (pectus carinatum):** See fig 2.23.
- **Funnel chest (pectus excavatum):** Developmental defect involving local sternum depression (lower end). See fig 2.24.
- **Kyphosis:** 'Humpback' from ↑AP thoracic spine curvature.
- **Scoliosis:** Lateral curvature (OHCS p674); all of these may cause a restrictive ventilatory defect.

| Prominent sternum, from lung hyperinflation while the bony thorax is still developing, eg in chronic childhood asthma. Often seen with Harrison's sulcus, a groove deformity caused by indrawing of lower ribs at the diaphragm attachment site. This usually has little functional significance in terms of respiration but can have significant psychological effects: see BOX. | It is often asymptomatic, but may cause displacement of the heart to the left, and restricted ventilatory capacity ± mild air-trapping. Associations: scoliosis; Marfan's; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. |

### Herr Minty and his pigeon chest

Chest wall deformities such as pectus excavatum are quite common, often appearing during adolescent growth spurts. Exercise intolerance is the main symptom (from heart compression—consider CXR/CT). Indications for surgical correction (rarely needed): ≥2: a severe, symptomatic deformity; progression of deformity; paradoxical respiratory chest wall motion; pectus index >3.25 on CT; cardiac or lung compression; restrictive spirometry; cardiac pathology that might be from compression of the heart.

Psychological effects are interesting and not to be dismissed as their effects may be greater than any physical effects. Because these people hate exposing their chests they may become introverted, and never learn to swim, so don't let them sink without trace. Be sympathetic, and remember Herr Minty, who inaugurated Graham Greene's theory of compensation: wherever a defect exists we must look for a compensating perfection to account for how the defect survives. In Minty's case, although 'crooked and yellow and pigeon-chested he had his deep refuge, the inexhaustible ingenuity of his mind.'
