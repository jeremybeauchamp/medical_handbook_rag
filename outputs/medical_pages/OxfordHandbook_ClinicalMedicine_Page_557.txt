## Neurosurgical emergencies

▶Acute cauda equina compression Alternating or bilateral root pain in legs, saddle anaesthesia (perianal), loss of anal tone on PR, bladder ± bowel incontinence.
▶Acute cord compression Bilateral pain, LMN signs (p446) at level of compression, UMN and sensory loss below, sphincter disturbance.

Immediate urgent treatment prevents irreversible loss, eg laminectomy for disc protrusions, radiotherapy for tumours, decompression for abscesses.

Causes (same for both): bony metastasis (look for missing pedicle on x-ray), large disc protrusion, myeloma, cord or paraspinal tumour, TB (p392), abscess.
