## Amyloid

Pathological folding of proteins leads to extracellular accumulation and organ dysfunction including kidney disease. Classified according to protein: light chains in myeloma = AL amyloid; serum amyloid A in chronic inflammation = AA amyloid; also rare familial types. 

**Diagnosis:** Congo red staining on biopsy, SAP scan. 

**Treatment:** Underlying condition. New therapies target amyloid production, aggregation, and breakdown.

## Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)

Presents with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Hb <100g/L, ↑LDH, ↓haptoglobin, fragments on blood film), ↓platelets and AKI due to thrombosis of the glomerular capillaries (microangiopathy). In children, primarily associated with haemorrhagic colitis due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) eg O157:H7. Atypical HUS caused by dysregulation/uncontrolled activation of complement = ~5% of HUS. Can be precipitated by pregnancy. 

**Diagnosis:** Triad of haemolytic anaemia, ↓platelets, and AKI with haematuria/proteinuria. ?Evidence of STEC. Look for abnormalities in the complement pathway: levels of C3, C4, factors H and I, complement mutation screen. 

**Treatment:** STEC-HUS: supportive. aHUS: plasma infusion/exchange, eculizumab (anti-C5) in England via the national aHUS centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

## Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

Symptoms overlap with HUS (see previous paragraph). Pentad: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, ↓platelets, AKI, neurological symptoms (headache, palsies, seizure, confusion, coma), and fever. Due to a congenital deficiency of, or acquired antibodies to, the ADAMTS13 protease which normally cleaves multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Large VWF multimers cause platelet aggregation and fibrin deposition in small vessels, leading to a multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical. ADAMTS13 activity. 

**Treatment:** ▶TTP is a haematological emergency: get expert help. Plasma infusion/exchange removes antibodies/replaces ADAMTS13 and may be life-saving. Corticosteroids. Consider rituximab for non-responders/relapse.

## Atherosclerotic renovascular disease

Part of a systemic atheromatous vascular disease including cardio-, cerebro-, and peripheral vascular disease (ask about claudication, check foot pulses), ↑BP, and ↑lipids. Leads to renin–angiotensin upregulation which causes treatment-resistant ↑BP and/or a deterioration in renal function on ACE-i/ARB. Acute decompensated heart failure (no LV impairment on echo) with flash pulmonary oedema in up to 10%. 

**Diagnosis:** >1.5cm asymmetry in renal size (but ↓sensitivity and ↓specificity). Doppler studies of native kidneys not consistently accurate for diagnosis. CT or MR (avoids contrast) angiography. 

**Treatment:** Modification of CV risk factors: statin, aspirin, antihypertensive treatment. Historically, ACE-i/ARB were considered contraindicated due to concern about renin-dependent renal perfusion and deterioration in function on ACE-i/ARB. However, ↓mortality seen with ACE-i/ARB. ↓eGFR by <25% 'sacrificed' for longer-term renal and cardiac outcome. Large RCTs of medical treatment vs revascularization have failed to show an advantage to revascularization ∴ only considered in flash pulmonary oedema, rapid/oligo-anuric renal failure.

## Scleroderma renal crisis

Occurs in ~5% of systemic sclerosis. ↑Risk with: diffuse disease, anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies and <2yr from diagnosis. 

**Diagnosis:** Accelerated hypertension (new >150/85mmHg) and AKI (↓eGFR by >30%). Biopsy: collapsed glomeruli, onion-skin thickening of arterioles. 

**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB. IV vasodilators to ↓vascular resistance and for digital ischaemia. Care with β-blockers as ↑HR compensating for ↓stroke volume. May recover renal function after many months.

## Sickle cell nephropathy

HbSS is associated with hyperfiltration (lower than expected creatinine) and albuminuria. Although up to 75% of young patients will have some degree of CKD, progression to renal failure is usually associated with another trigger, eg papillary necrosis, infection. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical. Biopsy only if looking for another diagnosis, eg AKI without clinical cause, nephrotic syndrome. 

**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB. Inconsistent data re hydroxycarbamide and hyperfiltration. ↑Mortality on dialysis: aim to transplant.
