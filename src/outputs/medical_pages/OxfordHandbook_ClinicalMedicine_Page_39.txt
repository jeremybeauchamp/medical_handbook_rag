# Advice and experience

1. The way to learn physical signs is at the bedside, with guidance from a senior doctor or an experienced colleague. This chapter is not a substitute for this process: it is simply an aide-memoire both on the wards and when preparing for exams.

2. We ask questions to get information to help with differential diagnosis. But we also ask questions to find out about the lives our patients live so that we can respect them as individuals. The patient is likely to notice and reciprocate this respect, and the rapport that you build with your patient in this way is a key component to diagnosing and managing their disease.

3. Patients (and diseases) rarely read textbooks, so don't be surprised that some symptoms are ambiguous, and others meaningless. Get good at recognizing patterns, but not so good that you create them when none exist. We all fall into this trap!

4. Signs can be easy to detect, or subtle. Some will be found by all the new medical students, others require experienced ears or eyes. Remember, you can be a fine doctor without being able to elicit every sign! However, finding signs and putting together the clues they give us to find a diagnosis is one of the best parts of being a doctor. It is also essential that we learn those signs that highlight diseases we should never miss. However, in an exam, if you cannot find a sign, never be tempted to make up something you think should be there. If the examiner is pushing you to describe something you cannot see, be honest and admit you cannot see it. Learning is a lifelong process, and nobody becomes a consultant overnight.

## Developing your own routine

While on the acute medical or surgical take you will 'clerk' countless numbers of patients. This involves taking a full history: history-taking may seem deceptively easy, as if the patient knew the hard facts and the only problem was extracting them; but what a patient says is a mixture of hearsay ('She said I looked very pale'), innuendo ('You know, doctor, down below'), legend ('I suppose I bit my tongue; it was a real fit, you know'), exaggeration ('I didn't sleep a wink'), and improbabilities ('The Pope put a transmitter in my brain'). The great skill (and pleasure) in taking a history lies not in ignoring these garbled messages, but in making sense of them. Next you will likely perform all the core examinations (cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological) and any relevant additional ones (eg breast, thyroid, peripheral vascular). No two doctors will have identical examination techniques. Relish this variation as it helps you craft your own routine.

## An insightful student

Having a template for the all-important history and examination is no more than a rough guide and you must flesh it out with your own learning. We start out nervous of missing some question or sign, but what we should really be nervous about is losing our humanity in the hurly-burly of a time-pressed interview. Here is how one student put some flesh on the bones—for a man in a wheelchair: she asked all about the presenting complaint, and how it fitted in with his CNS condition and life at home—and then found out that his daughter had had a nervous breakdown at the start of his illness, 5 years ago. 'How is she now?' she asked. 'Fine—I've got two lovely grandchildren...Jim is just learning to walk...' 'Oh...you must be so busy!' the student said with a joyful smile. This man had not been busy for 5 years, and was fed up with his passive dependency. The thought of being busy again made his face light up—and when the student left he rose up out of his wheelchair to shake her by the hand, a movement we doctors thought was impossible. Jim and his grandfather were learning to walk, but this student was up and running—far ahead of her teachers.
