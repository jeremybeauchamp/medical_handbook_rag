# Inherited kidney disease

## Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)

1 in 400-1000 (~7 million worldwide). De novo mutation in ~10%. 2/3 will require renal replacement. 85% have mutations in PKD1 (chromosome 16) and reach ESRF by 50s. Mutation in PKD2 (chromosome 4) has a slower course, reaching ESRF by 70s.

Presentation: May be clinically silent unless cysts become symptomatic due to size/haemorrhage (fig 7.14). Loin pain, visible haematuria, cyst infection, renal calculi, ↑BP, progressive renal failure. Extrarenal: liver cysts, intracranial aneurysm→SAH (p478), mitral valve prolapse, ovarian cyst, diverticular disease. 

Diagnosis: USS is modality of choice. Renal cysts are common and ↑prevalence with age so diagnostic criteria are age-specific: 15-39yrs ≥3 cysts, 40-59yrs >2 cysts in each kidney give a positive predictive value of 100% for both PKD1 and PKD2 mutations. Sensitivity is >93% for PKD1 but only 69% for diagnosis of PKD2 <30 years. Liver (90% by age 50) and pancreatic cysts (~10%) support the diagnosis. Genetic testing available but ~1500 different mutations are described so use limited to diagnostic uncertainty, potential donors, and pre-implantation diagnosis. (Non-contrast) CT for renal colic as cysts obscure view on USS. Screening for intracranial aneurysms (MRI) recommended for age <65yrs if personal/family history of aneurysm/SAH. 

Treatment: Water intake 3-4L/day (if eGFR >30) may suppress cyst growth. BP should be treated to target <130/80mmHg: 1st-line ACE-i/ARB, 2nd-line thiazide-like, 3rd-line β-blocker (not calcium channel blocker as ↑Ca²⁺ entry is part of pathology although no specific outcome data). Treat infection. Haematuria usually managed conservatively. Persistent/severe pain may need cyst decompression. Plan for RRT including pre-emptive transplantation. Ongoing research evaluating drugs which inhibit cyst growth including vasopressin antagonists (tolvaptan: decrease in kidney volume seen), somatostatin analogues, metformin, and transcription inhibitors.

## Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease

1 in 20 000, chromosome 6. Presents ante/perinatally with renal cysts ('salt and pepper' appearance on USS), congenital hepatic fibrosis→portal hypertension. Poor prognosis if neonatal respiratory distress. No specific therapy. (See OHCS p132.)

## Renal phakomatoses

### Tuberous sclerosis complex: 
1 in 6000, autosomal dominant. Two genes: TSC1 (chromosome 9) and TSC2 (chromosome 16). Multisystem disorder with hamartoma formation in skin, brain (→epilepsy), eye, heart, and lung (see OHCS p638). In kidney: angiomyolipomata in 90% with risk of aneurysm and haemorrhage, cystic disease in 50%. Replacement of renal tissue leads to kidney failure. mTORC1 inhibitors (eg sirolimus, everolimus) block pathological cell signalling and reduce tumour volume.

### Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome: 
1 in 36 000, autosomal dominant (p712). Mutation in VHL gene (chromosome 3) leads to uncontrolled activation of growth factors. Phenotype is a familial, multisystem cancer syndrome including renal cysts and clear cell renal carcinoma at mean age 40s, ~70% risk by age 60 (VHL tumour-suppressor gene is inactivated in most sporadic renal cell cancers). Manage by screening for tumours. Possibility of future therapies which inhibit growth factor signalling.

## Alport syndrome

1 in 5000. ~80-85% X-linked. Due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene, which encodes the α5 chain of type IV collagen. Haematuria, proteinuria, and progressive renal insufficiency. Average age of renal failure in men 30-40yrs. Female 'carriers' can exhibit the phenotype, renal failure in ~30% by 60yrs. High-tone sensorineural hearing loss. Anterior lenticonus: bulging of lens seen on slit-lamp examination (see OHCS p638). Type IV collagen is the antigen in anti-GBM disease (p311) so there is a risk of anti-GBM disease following transplantation as the graft type IV collagen is recognized as 'foreign'.

## Fabry disease

1 in 40 000-120 000. X-linked. Lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of the enzyme α-galactosidase-A. Causes proteinuria and progressive renal failure in most men and some female 'carriers'. Lipid deposits are seen in urine and on renal biopsy ('zebra body'). Treatment with IV enzyme replacement can stabilize kidney function if proteinuria controlled to <1g/24h.
