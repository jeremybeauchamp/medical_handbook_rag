Fig 14.1 Rosalyn Yalow (1921-2011). Trained in nuclear physics, and made good use of this when she developed the radioimmunoassay technique to allow trace amounts of peptides to be measured in serum using antibodies. This revolutionized laboratory medicine, making reliable assays for hormones widely available, and underpinned the development of endocrinology. It was also employed to screen blood against a range of pathogens, and the technique is still commonly used today. She was awarded the Nobel prize for her work in 1977, and commented to a group of children that: 'Initially, new ideas are rejected...Later they become dogma, if you're right. And if you're really lucky you can publish your rejections as part of your Nobel presentation.'

## On being normal in the society of numbers

Laboratory medicine reduces our patients to a few easy-to-handle numbers: this is the discipline's great attraction—and its greatest danger. The normal range (reference interval) is usually that which includes 95% of a given population (given a normal distribution, see p750). If variation is randomly distributed, 2.5% of our results will be 'too high', and 2.5% 'too low' on an average day, when dealing with apparently normal people. This statistical definition of normality is the simplest. Other definitions may be normative—ie stating what an upper or lower limit should be. The upper end of the reference interval for plasma cholesterol may be given as 6mmol/L because this is what biochemists state to be the desired maximum. 40% of people in some populations will have a plasma cholesterol greater than 6mmol/L and thus may be at increased risk. The WHO definition of anaemia in pregnancy is an Hb of <110g/L, which makes 20% of mothers anaemic. This 'lax' criterion has the presumed benefit of triggering actions that result in fewer deaths from haemorrhage. So do not just ask 'What is the normal range?'—also enquire about who set the range, for what population, and for what reason.
