## Clinical features of TB

### Systemic features:
Low-grade fever, anorexia, weight loss, malaise, night sweats, clubbing (bronchiectasis), erythema nodosum (p562).

### Pulmonary TB:
Cough (in ~50%, >2â€“3 weeks, dry then productive), pleurisy, haemoptysis (uncommon, seen with bronchiectasis : not always active disease), pleural effusion. An aspergilloma/mycetoma (p177) may form in the cavities. Presentation varies and may be silent or atypical, especially with immunosuppression, eg HIV, post-transplantation.

### Tuberculous lymphadenitis:
(Usually) painless enlargement of cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Axillary and inguinal node involvement less common. Coexisting systemic symptoms in 40-50%. Node is typically firm to touch and not acutely inflamed ('cold abscess'). Skin can adhere to the underlying mass with risk of rupture and sinus formation. Can occur with or without pulmonary disease. Investigate with fine-needle aspiration, AFB staining, and culture (p394).

### Gastrointestinal TB:
Most disease is ileocaecal. Causes colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. Bowel obstruction can occur due to bowel wall thickening, stricture formation, or inflammatory adhesions. Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Caseation necrosis and an absence of transmural cracks/fissures distinguish from Crohn's disease.

### Spinal TB:
Local pain and bony tenderness for weeks-months. Slow, insidious progression. May not present until deformity or neurological symptoms. Look for bony destruction, vertebral collapse, and soft tissue abscess (see Pott's vertebra p708).

### Miliary TB:
Haematogenous dissemination leads to the formation of discrete foci (~2mm) of granulomatous tissue throughout the lung ('millet' seed appearance). CXR: fig 9.9. Dissemination is throughout the body with meningeal involvement in ~25%. Sputum may be negative for AFB as spread is haematogenous. Have a low threshold for LP. Untreated mortality is assumed to be close to 100%. Do not delay treatment while test results are pending.

### CNS TB:
Haematogenous spread leading to foci of infection in brain and spinal cord. Foci can enlarge to form tuberculomas. Foci rupture leads to meningitis. Risk with immune suppression, HIV, aged <3y. Headache, meningism, confusion, seizures, focal neurological deficit, and systemic symptoms. Needs LP and examination of CSF (leucocytosis, raised protein, CSF: plasma glucose <50%, AFB stain, PCR and culture). Look for TB elsewhere (CXR, etc), test for HIV. CT/MRI may show hydrocephalus, basal exudates. Tuberculomas are ring-enhancing. All rapid diagnostic tests (p394) have sensitivity, so treat on suspicion.

### Genitourinary TB:
Symptoms may be chronic, intermittent, or silent. Include dysuria, frequency, loin pain, haematuria, sterile pyuria (see p296). Granuloma may cause fibrosis, strictures, infertility, and genital ulceration.

### Cardiac TB:
Usually involves the pericardium: pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and/or constrictive pericarditis (p154). Check chest imaging for other TB pathology, eg pulmonary disease, mediastinal lymph nodes. Pericardiectomy may be indicated for persistent constriction despite anti-tuberculous treatment. Myocardial involvement (arrhythmias, heart failure, ventricular aneurysm, or outflow obstruction) is rare.

### Skin:
Lupus vulgaris = persistent, progressive, cutaneous TB: red-brown, 'apple-jelly' nodules. Scrofuloderma: skin lesion extended from underlying infection eg lymph node, bone; causes ulceration and scarring.
