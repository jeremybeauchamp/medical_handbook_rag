Fig 11.1 How not to break bad news. The third day of admission brings me some examples of doctor's communication skills being the worst I could possibly imagine under the most painful of circumstances...I'm laid in a hospital bed sobbing and scared, about at the most vulnerable a patient could be...a young gynaecology SHO I have never met enters my room...I can tell he has pulled the short straw... He nervously sits down next to me and out of the blue, after a cursory introduction tells me, 'Your MRI shows evidence of spread'. I am quite astounded at the lack of quality communication given the circumstances.

*The Other Side, by Kate Granger MBE, FRCP, 1981-2016.*

Kate Granger, a medical registrar then consultant geriatrician, was diagnosed with a desmoplastic small round cell tumour at the age of 29. This is a cancer that medical science has no answer to. But Kate had her own answer. She turned her terminal diagnosis on its head and began a dialogue on death and dying, offering her experience as an inspirational lesson in compassion and care. Before you are a patient, before you have cancer, but most importantly, before you are a doctor, you are simply a human being. And if your humanity is lost or forgotten, then you cannot care, even if medical science is able to provide an answer. hellomynameis.org.uk; #hellomynameis
