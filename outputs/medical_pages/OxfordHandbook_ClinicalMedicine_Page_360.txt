346 An approach to bleeding

There are three sets of questions to be answered:

1 Is there an emergency needing immediate resuscitation or senior help?
- Is the patient about to exsanguinate (dizzy on sitting up, shock, coma)?
- Is there hypovolaemia (postural hypotension, oliguria)?
- Is there CNS bleeding (meningism, CNS and retinal signs)?
- Is there an underlying condition which escalates apparently minor bleeding into
  an evolving catastrophe? For example:
  - Bleeding in pregnancy or the puerperium.
  - GI bleeding in a jaundiced patient (ie coagulation factors already depleted).
  - Bleeding in someone who is already anaemic (esp if other comorbidities).

2 Why is the patient bleeding? Is bleeding normal, given the circumstances (eg
surgery, trauma, parturition), or does the patient have a bleeding disorder (BOX
'Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding')?
- Is there a secondary cause, eg drugs (warfarin), alcohol, liver disease, sepsis?
- Is there unexplained bleeding, bruising, or purpura?
- Past or family history of excess bleeding, eg during trauma, dentistry, surgery?
- Is the pattern of bleeding indicative of vascular, platelet, or coagulation prob-
  lems (p344)? Are old venepuncture or cannula sites bleeding (DIC, p352)? Look
  for associated conditions (eg with DIC).
- Is a clotting screen abnormal (table 8.3)? Check FBC, platelets, PT, APTT, and
  thrombin time. Consider D-dimers, bleeding time, and a factor VIII assay. If
  both PT and APTT are very raised, with low platelets and D-dimers, consider
  DIC (p352).

3 In cases of bleeding disorders, what is the mechanism? Investigate with
FBC, film, and coagulation screen (citrate tube; false results if under-filled):
- Prothrombin time (PT): Thromboplastin is added to test the extrinsic system.
  PT is expressed as a ratio compared to control (international normalized ratio
  (INR), normal range = 0.9-1.2). It tests for abnormalities in factors I, II, V, VII, X.
  Prolonged by: warfarin, vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, DIC.
- Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT): Kaolin is added to test the
  intrinsic system. Tests for abnormalities in factor I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Normal
  range 35-45s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, haemophilia, DIC, liver disease.
- Thrombin time: Thrombin is added to plasma to convert fibrinogen to fibrin.
  Normal range: 10-15s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, DIC, dysfibrinogenaemia.
- D-dimers are a fibrin degradation product, released from cross-linked fibrin
  during fibrinolysis (p345). This occurs during DIC, or in the presence of venous
  thromboembolism—deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
  D-dimers may also be raised in inflammation, eg with infection or malignancy.

Management Depends on the degree of bleeding. If shocked, resuscitate (p790). If
bleeding continues in the presence of a clotting disorder or a massive transfusion,
discuss the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates, or platelets with a
haematologist. In ITP (p345), steroids ± IV immunoglobulin may be used. Especially
in pregnancy (OHCS p88), consult an expert. Is there overdose with anticoagulants
(p842)? In haemophiliac bleeds, consult early for coagulation factor replacement.
Never give IM injections.
