# Managing infective diarrhoea*

| No systemic signs | Systemic illness: | Special circumstances: |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| | • Fever >39°C; dehydration | • Food poisoning outbreak |
| | • Diarrhoea + visible blood (=dysentery) for >2wks | • Travel (p428 & p430) |
| | | • Recent antibiotic use |
| | | • Rectal intercourse |
| | • Admit to hospital; oral fluids | • Immunocompromised |
| Symptomatic Rx | • Consider presumptive Rx† unless a non-infectious cause is found | • Raw seafood ingestion |
| | | |
| Stool culture not needed | Prompt, direct faecal smear (then culture) | Routine culture and microscopy. Ask microbiologist about Rx |
| | | |
| Polymorphs seen | No polymorphs seen | Parasites seen |

| Likely culture: | Likely culture: | Specific Rx, eg |
| • Shigella† | • Salmonella† | p432-435 |
| • Campylobacter | • E. coli | |
| • E. coli | • C. difficile (see BOX 'Clostridium difficile') | |
| More rarely: | Culture -ve causes: | |
| • C. difficile (see BOX 'Clostridium difficile') | • eg Norovirus (eg with | |
| • Yersinia enterocolitica | projectile vomiting, | |
| • Salmonella | p430) | |

*Be aware of local pathogens, and be prepared to close wards and hospitals if contagion is afoot.
†Prompt specific Rx: eg ciprofloxacin 500mg/12h PO for 6d may be needed before sensitivities are known.
Metronidazole is also tried, as Giardia is a common cause of watery diarrhoea in travellers.

## Clostridium difficile: the cause of pseudomembranous colitis

First isolated from stools of healthy neonates, C. difficile was named owing to difficulties in culture. Today, 'difficile' might better refer to challenges of containment.

Signs: ↑T°; colic; diarrhoea with systemic upset—↑↑CRP, ↑WCC, ↓albumin, and colitis (with yellow adherent plaques on inflamed non-ulcerated mucosa—the pseudomembrane) progressing to toxic megacolon and multi-organ failure.

Asymptomatic carriage: 2-5% of all adults. Only problematic with gut ecology disrupted by, eg antibiotics, leading to rapid proliferation and toxin expression.

Predictors of fulminant C. diff colitis: >70yrs, past C. diff infection; use of anti-peristaltic drugs; severe leucocytosis; haemodynamic instability.

Detection: Urgent testing of suspicious stool (characteristic smell—ask the nurses). Two-stage process with rapid screening test for C. diff protein (or PCR) followed by specific ELISA for toxins. AXR for toxic megacolon.

Rx: Stop causative antibiotic if possible. Mild disease: metronidazole 400mg/8h PO for 10-14d (vancomycin 125mg/6h PO is better in severe disease). Intensive regimens of vancomycin 500mg/6h with IV and PR vancomycin may be needed for non-responders. ►Urgent colectomy may be needed if toxic megacolon, ↑LDH, or if deteriorating.

Recurrent disease: Common (≈25%). Fidaxomicin, a minimally absorbed oral antibiotic, is associated with lower relapse rates. Faecal transplantation (introduction of a suspension prepared from the faeces of a screened donor via endoscopy or via NG/NJ tube) is a highly effective, if aesthetically unappealing, method of treatment.

Preventing spread: Meticulous cleaning and appropriate bed management policies, use of disposable gloves and aprons, hand-washing (not just gel—kill the spores).
