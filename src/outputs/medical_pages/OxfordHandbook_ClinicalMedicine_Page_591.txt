## Post-operative bleeding

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Primary haemorrhage | Continuous bleeding, starting during surgery. Replace blood loss. If severe, return to theatre for adequate haemostasis. Treat shock vigorously (p790-804). |
| Reactive haemorrhage | Haemostasis appears secure until BP rises and bleeding starts. Replace blood and re-explore wound. |
| Secondary haemorrhage | (caused by infection) occurs 1-2wks post-op. |

## Talking about post-op complications...

When asked to give your thoughts on the complications of an operation—maybe with an examiner or a patient—a good starting point is to divide them up accordingly (and for each of the following stratify as immediate, early, and late):

- From the anaesthetic: (p572.) Eg respiratory depression from induction agents.
- From surgery in general: (p576.) Eg wound infection, haemorrhage, neurovascular damage, DVT/PE.
- From the specific procedure: Eg saphenous nerve damage in stripping of the long varicose vein.

Tailor the discussion towards the individual who, eg if an arteriopath, may have a significant risk of cardiac ischaemia during hypotensive episodes while under the anaesthetic. For some other post-op complications, see:

- Pain (p574)
- DVT (p578)
- Pulmonary embolus (p190; massive, p818)
- Wound dehiscence (p580)
- Complications in post-gastric surgery (p622)
- Other complications of specific operations (p580).
