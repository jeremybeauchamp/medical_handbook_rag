# The Hippocratic oath ~4th century BC

I swear by Apollo the physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panacea and all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfil according to my ability and judgement this oath and this covenant.

To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my own brethren and to teach them this art, if they desire to learn it, without fee and covenant. I will impart it by precept, by lecture and by all other manner of teaching, not only to my own sons but also to the sons of him who has taught me, and to disciples bound by covenant and oath according to the law of physicians, but to none other.

The regimen I shall adopt shall be to the benefit of the patients to the best of my power and judgement, not for their injury or any wrongful purpose.

I will not give a deadly drug to anyone though it be asked of me, nor will I lead the way in such counsel.¹ And likewise I will not give a woman a pessary to procure abortion.² But I will keep my life and my art in purity and holiness. I will not use the knife,³ not even, verily, on sufferers of stone but I will give place to such as are craftsmen therein.

Whatsoever house I enter, I will enter for the benefit of the sick, refraining from all voluntary wrongdoing and corruption, especially seduction of male or female, bond or free.

Whatsoever things I see or hear concerning the life of men, in my attendance on the sick, or even apart from my attendance, which ought not to be blabbed abroad, I will keep silence on them, counting such things to be as religious secrets.

If I fulfil this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art alike, with good repute for all time to come; but may the contrary befall me if I transgress and violate my oath.

## The endurance of the Hippocratic oath

Paternalistic, irrelevant, inadequate, and possibly plagiarized from the followers of Pythagoras of Samos; it is argued that the Hippocratic oath has failed to evolve into anything more than a right of passage for physicians. Is it adequate to address the scientific, political, social, and economic realities that exist for doctors today? Certainly, medical training without a fee appears to have been confined to history. Yet it remains one of the oldest binding documents in history and its principles of commitment, ethics, justice, professionalism, and confidentiality transcend time.

The absence of autonomy as a fundamental tenet of modern medical care can be debated. But just as anatomy and physiology have been added to the doctor's repertoire since Hippocrates, omissions should not undermine the oath as a paradigm of self-regulation amongst a group of specialists committed to an ideal. And do not forget that illness may represent a temporary loss of autonomy caused by fear, vulnerability, and a subjective weighting of present versus future. It could be argued that Hippocratic paternalism is, in fact, required to restore autonomy.

Contemporary versions of the oath often fail to make doctors accountable for keeping to any aspect of the pledge. And beware the oath that is nothing more than historic ritual without accountability, for then it can be superseded by personal, political, social, or economic priorities:

> 'In Auschwitz, doctors presided over the murder of most of the one million victims.... [They] did not recall being especially aware in Auschwitz of their Hippocratic oath, and were not surprisingly, uncomfortable discussing it...The oath of loyalty to Hitler...was much more real to them.'
> 
> Robert Jay Lifton, The Nazi Doctors.

1. This is unlikely to be a commentary on euthanasia (easeful death) as the oath predates the word. Rather, it is believed to allude to the common practice of using doctors as political assassins.
2. Abortion by oral methods was legal in ancient Greece. The oath cautions only against the use of pessaries as a potential source of lethal infection.
3. The oath does not disavow surgery, merely asks the physician to cede to others with expertise.
