Fig 15.22 Meningococcal sepsis with purpura.

The photograph depicts the lower legs and feet of a patient lying on what appears to be a blue medical sheet. The skin of the legs shows extensive purpuric lesions, which are dark, irregular patches characteristic of meningococcal sepsis. The lesions cover large areas of both legs, with some areas appearing more severely affected than others.
