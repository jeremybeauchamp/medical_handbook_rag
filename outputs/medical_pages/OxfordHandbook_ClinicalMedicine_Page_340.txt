326 Iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA)

This is common (seen in up to 14% of menstruating women).

Causes
• Blood loss, eg menorrhagia or GI bleeding² (upper p256; lower p629).
• Poor diet or poverty may cause IDA in babies or children (but rarely in adults).
• Malabsorption (eg coeliac disease) is a cause of refractory IDA.
• In the tropics, hookworm (GI blood loss) is the most common cause.

Signs Chronic IDA (signs now rare): koilonychia (fig 8.4 and p76), atrophic glossitis, angular cheilosis (fig 8.5), and, rarely, post-cricoid webs (Plummer-Vinson syndrome).

Tests Blood film: microcytic, hypochromic anaemia with anisocytosis and poikilocytosis (figs 8.6, 8.7). ↓MCV, ↓MCH, and ↓MCHC. Confirmed by ↓ferritin (also ↓serum iron with ↑TIBC, but these are less reliable, see table 8.1). ►NB: ferritin is an acute phase protein and ↑ with inflammation, eg infection, malignancy. Transferrin is also ↑ in IDA but is less affected by inflammation. Check coeliac serology in all (p266): if negative then refer all males and females who are not menstruating for urgent gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Consider stool microscopy for ova if relevant travel history. Faecal occult blood is not recommended as sensitivity is poor. ►IDA with no obvious source of bleeding mandates careful GI workup².

Treatment Treat the cause. Oral iron, eg ferrous sulfate 200mg/8h PO. SE: nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea or constipation, black stools. Hb should rise by 10g/L/week, with a modest reticulocytosis (young RBC, p328). Continue for at least 3 months after Hb normalizes to replenish stores. IV iron is only indicated if the oral route is impossible or ineffective, eg functional iron deficiency in chronic renal failure, where there is inadequate mobilization of iron stores in response to erythropoietin therapy.

The usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient has rejected the pills—check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI disturbance? Altering the dose of elemental iron with a different preparation may help. Alternatively, there may be continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chronic disease; or misdiagnosis, eg when thalassaemia is to blame.

## Anaemia of chronic disease (secondary anaemia)

The commonest anaemia in hospital patients (and the 2nd commonest, after IDA, worldwide). It arises from three problems (in which the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role): 1 Poor use of iron in erythropoiesis. 2 Cytokine-induced shortening of RBC survival. 3 ↓Production of and response to erythropoietin.

Causes Many, eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure.

Tests Ferritin normal or ↑ in mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia (eg Hb >80g/L; see table 8.1). Check blood film, B₁₂, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis (p336).

Treatment Treating the underlying disease may help (eg in 60% of patients with RA), as may erythropoietin (SE: flu-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the platelet count and thromboembolism). Also effective in improving quality of life in malignant disease. IV iron can safely overcome the functional iron deficiency. Hepcidin inhibitors and inflammatory modulators show promise.

## Sideroblastic anaemia

Microcytic anaemia does not always mean iron deficiency! 20% of older people with an MCV <75fL are not iron deficient. ►Think of sideroblastic anaemia whenever microcytic anaemia is not responding to iron. This condition is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to ↑iron absorption, iron loading in marrow ± haemosiderosis (endocrine, liver, and heart damage due to iron deposition).

Causes Congenital (rare, x-linked) or acquired, eg idiopathic as one of the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, can also follow chemotherapy, anti-TB drugs, irradiation, alcohol or lead excess. Tests Look for ↑ferritin, a hypochromic blood film, and disease-defining sideroblasts in the marrow (figs 8.8, 8.9; table 8.1). Treatment Remove the cause. Pyridoxine ± repeated transfusions for severe anaemia.

² In one study, 11% presenting to their GP with IDA had GI carcinoma. Plan both upper and lower GI investigation: there may be abnormalities on both.
