## Medical care

### Advice for doctors

- Do not blame the sick for being sick.
- Seek to discover your patient's wishes and comply with them.
- Learn.
- Work for your patients, not your consultant.
- Respect opinions.
- Treat a patient, not a disease.
- Admit a person, not a diagnosis.
- Spend time with the bereaved; help them to shed tears.
- Give the patient (and yourself) time: for questions, to reflect, and to allow healing.
- Give patients the benefit of the doubt.
- Be optimistic.
- Be kind to yourself: you are not an inexhaustible resource.
- Question your conscience.
- Tell the truth.
- Recognize that the scientific approach may be finite, but experience and empathy are limitless.

### Medicine and the stars

Decision and intervention are the essence of action, reflection and conjecture are the essence of thought; the essence of medicine is combining these in the service of others. We offer our ideals to stimulate thought and action: like the stars, ideals are hard to reach, but they are used for navigation. Orion (fig 1.2) is our star of choice. His constellation is visible across the globe so he links our readers everywhere, and he will remain recognizable long after other constellations have distorted.

**Fig 1.2** The constellation of Orion has three superb stars: Bellatrix (the stethoscope's bell), Betelgeuse (B), and Rigel (R). The three stars at the crossover (Orion's Belt) are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka.

### The National Health Service

> "The resources of medical skill and the apparatus of healing shall be placed at the disposal of the patient, without charge, when he or she needs them; that medical treatment and care should be a communal responsibility, that they should be made available to rich and poor alike in accordance with medical need and by no other criteria...Society becomes more wholesome, more serene, and spiritually healthier, if it knows that its citizens have at the back of their consciousness the knowledge that not only themselves, but all their fellows, have access, when ill, to the best that medical skill can provide...You can always 'pass by on the other side'. That may be sound economics. It could not be worse morals."

> Aneurin Bevan, In Place of Fear, 1952.

In 2014, the Commonwealth Fund presented an overview of international healthcare systems examining financing, governance, healthcare quality, efficiency, evidence-based practice, and innovation. In a scoring system of 11 nations across 11 categories, the NHS came first overall, at less than half the cost per head spent in the USA.¹

The King's Fund debunks the myth that the NHS is unaffordable in the modern era,² although funding remains a political choice. Bevan prophesied, "The NHS will last as long as there are folk left with the faith to fight for it." Guard it well.
