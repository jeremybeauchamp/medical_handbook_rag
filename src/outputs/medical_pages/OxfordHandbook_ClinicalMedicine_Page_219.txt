The image shows a mostly blank page with minimal content. Here's the markdown representation of the visible elements:

# Endocrinology

In the top right corner of the page, there's the number "205".

At the bottom right, there's a small orange icon with three circles.

The word "Endocrinology" is written vertically along the right edge of the page in an orange bar.
