# Surgical management of obesity

Severe obesity is increasing in prevalence worldwide and is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); hypertension; ischaemic heart disease; sleep apnoea; osteo-arthritis; and depression. Bariatric surgery has become very successful at weight reduction, symptom improvement, and improving quality of life. Surgery increases life expectancy by around 3 years (but may not prolong survival in high-risk men).

## Indications
According to NICE guidelines, weight-loss surgery in adults should be considered if all the following criteria are met:

1. BMI ≥40 (or ≥35 with significant comorbidities that could improve with weight).
2. Failure of non-surgical management to achieve and maintain clinically beneficial weight loss for 6 months.
3. Fitness for surgery and anaesthesia.
4. Intensive management in tier 3 service (provides guidance on diet, physical activity, and psychosocial concerns, as well as lifelong medical monitoring).
5. The patient must be well informed and motivated.

If BMI ≥50, or in newly diagnosed T2DM with BMI ≥30, surgery is recommended as first-line treatment.

## Comparison with medical therapy
Surgery is more effective in achieving weight loss than non-surgical management and weight loss is more likely to be maintained in the longer term. Adverse events are more common following surgery, and vary from one procedure to another.

## Procedures
There are two main mechanisms causing weight loss:
1. Restriction of calorie intake by reducing stomach capacity.
2. Malabsorption of nutrients by reducing the length of functional small bowel.

NB: This also affects the levels of circulating gut peptides (eg PYY and GLP-1), which are thought to play a role in the mechanism of satiety and weight loss. Choose surgical intervention jointly with patient:

- **Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB)**: This restrictive technique creates a pre-stomach pouch by placing a silicone band around the top of the stomach, which serves as a new smaller stomach. The band can be adjusted by addition or removal of saline through a subcutaneous port (see fig 13.40). LAGB is associated with improvements in comorbidities and quality of life. Weight loss is slower and less than with gastric bypass but there is lower mortality and fewer complications. Relatively non-invasive and band removal possible. Complications: pouch enlargement, band slip, band erosion, and port infection/breakage.

- **Sleeve gastrectomy**: (fig 13.41) Involves division of the stomach vertically, reducing it in size by about 75%. The pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach is left intact so function and digestion are unaltered. The procedure is not reversible and may be a first stage for progression to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or duodenal switch in very obese patients where a single-stage procedure would be technically difficult or unsafe.

- **Roux-en-Y gastric bypass**: (fig 13.42) Laparoscopic or open. A portion of the jejunum is attached to a small stomach pouch to allow food to bypass the distal stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. It can be performed laparoscopically and works by both restriction and malabsorption. Mean excess weight loss at 5 years is 62.8%. Current evidence demonstrates greater weight loss, greater resolution of comorbidities, and lower reoperation rates compared to LAGB. Complications: micronutrient deficiency (requires vitamin supplementation and lifelong follow-up/blood tests), dumping syndrome, wound infection, hernias, malabsorption, diarrhoea, and a mortality of <0.5% (at experienced centres).
