# Testing peripheral nerves

While there is some anatomical variation between individuals in ascribing particular nerve roots to muscles, tables 10.2-10.4 represent a reasonable compromise. Dermatomes and sensory nerve roots are shown in figs 10.5-10.9, pp454-5.

Remember to test proximal muscle power: ask the patient to sit from lying, to pull you towards him/herself, and to rise from squatting (if reasonably fit).

- Observe walking—easy to forget, even if the complaint is of difficulty walking!
- Don't be caught out by weakness secondary to musculoskeletal pathology—the traditional neurological examination relies on the musculoskeletal system being intact. Ruptured tendons and fractures may mimic focal neurological lesions (especially in patients who can't give a clear history).

## Table 10.2 Assessment of peripheral nerve function in the lower limb

| Nerve root | Muscle | Test by asking the patient to: |
|------------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Femoral nerve** |
| L1, 2, 3 | Iliopsoas (also supplied via L1, 2, & 3 spinal nerves) | Flex hip against resistance with knee flexed and lower leg supported: patient lies on back |
| L2, 3, 4 | Quadriceps femoris | Extend at knee against resistance. Start with knee flexed |
| **Obturator nerve** |
| L2, 3, 4 | Hip adductors | Adduct leg against resistance |
| **Inferior gluteal nerve** |
| L5, S1, S2 | Gluteus maximus | Hip extension ('bury heel into the couch')—with knee in extension |
| **Superior gluteal nerve** |
| L4, 5, S1 | Gluteus medius and minimus | Abduction and internal hip rotation with leg flexed at hip and knee |
| **Sciatic and common peroneal* nerves; sciatic and tibial** nerves** |
| *L4, 5 | Tibialis anterior | Dorsiflex ankle |
| *L5, S1 | Extensor digitorum longus | Dorsiflex toes against resistance |
| *L5, S1 | Extensor hallucis longus | Dorsiflex hallux against resistance |
| *L5, S1 | Peroneus longus and brevis | Evert foot against resistance |
| *L5, S1 | Extensor digitorum brevis | Dorsiflex proximal phalanges of toes |
| (*)L5, S1, 2 | Hamstrings (short head of biceps femoris is from the common peroneal nerve) | Flex knee against resistance |
| **L4, 5 | Tibialis posterior | Invert plantarflexed foot |
| **S1, 2 | Gastrocnemius | Plantarflex ankle or stand on tiptoe |
| **L5, S1, 2 | Flexor digitorum longus | Flex terminal joints of toes |
| **S1, 2 | Small muscles of foot | Make the sole of the foot into a cup |
