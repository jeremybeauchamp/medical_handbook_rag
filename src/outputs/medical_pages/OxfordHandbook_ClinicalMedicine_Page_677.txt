# The essence of laboratory medicine

## General principles
- Laboratory testing may contribute to four aspects of medicine:
  - diagnosis (eg TSH in hypothyrodism)
  - prognosis (eg clotting in liver failure)
  - monitoring disease activity or progression (eg creatinine in chronic kidney disease)
  - screening (eg phenylketonuria in newborn babies).
- Only do a test if the result will influence management. Make sure you look at the result.
- Always interpret laboratory results in the context of the patient's clinical picture.
- If a result does not fit with the clinical picture, trust clinical judgement and repeat the test. Could it be an artefact? The 'normal' range for a test (reference interval) is usually defined as the interval, symmetrical about the mean, containing 95% of results in a given population (p751). The more tests you run, the greater the probability of an 'abnormal' result of no significance (see p751).
- Laboratory staff like to have contact with you. They are an excellent source of help and information for both requests and results.
- Involve the patient. Don't forget to explain to them where the test fits into their overall management plan.

## Getting the best out of the lab—a laboratory decalogue
1. Interest someone from the laboratory in your patient's problem.
2. Fill in the request form fully.
3. Give clinical details, not your preferred diagnosis.
4. Ensure that the lab knows who to contact.
5. Label specimens as well as the request form.
6. Follow the hospital labelling routine for crossmatching.
7. Find out when analysers run, especially batched assays.
8. Talk with the lab before requesting an unusual test.
9. Be thoughtful: at 16:30h the routine results are being sorted.
10. Plot results graphically: abnormalities show sooner.

## Artefacts and pitfalls in laboratory tests
- Do not take blood samples from an arm that has IV fluid running into it.
- Repeat any unexpected and inconsistent result before acting on it.
- For clotting time do not sample from a heparinized IV catheter.
- Serum K+ is overestimated if the sample is old or haemolysed (this occurs if venepuncture is difficult).
- If using Vacutainers, fill plain tubes first—otherwise, anticoagulant contamination from previous tubes can cause errors.
- Total calcium results are affected by albumin concentration (p676).
- INR may be overestimated if citrate bottles are underfilled.
- Drugs may cause analytic errors (eg prednisolone cross-reacts with cortisol). Be suspicious if results are unexpected.
- Food may affect result, eg bananas raise urinary HIAA (p271).

## Ford Madox Ford 1915 'The Good Soldier'
Normal values can have hidden historical, social, and political desiderata—just like the normal values novelists ascribe to their characters: 'Conventions and traditions I suppose work blindly but surely for the preservation of the normal type; for the extinction of proud, resolute and unusual individuals... Society must go on, I suppose, and society can only exist if the normal, if the virtuous, and the slightly-deceitful flourish, and if the passionate, the headstrong, and the too-truthful are condemned to suicide and to madness. Yes, society must go on; it must breed, like rabbits. That is what we are here for ... But, at any rate, there is always Leonora to cheer you up; I don't want to sadden you. Her husband is quite an economical person of so normal a figure that he can get quite a large proportion of his clothes ready-made. That is the great desideratum of life.'
