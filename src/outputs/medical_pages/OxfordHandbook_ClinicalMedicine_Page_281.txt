# Causes of gastrointestinal malabsorption

Common in the UK: Coeliac disease; chronic pancreatitis; Crohn's disease.

Rarer:
- Bile: primary biliary cholangitis; ileal resection; biliary obstruction; colestyramine.
- Pancreatic insufficiency: pancreatic cancer; cystic fibrosis.
- Small bowel mucosa: Whipple's disease (p716); radiation enteritis; tropical sprue; small bowel resection; brush border enzyme deficiencies (eg lactase insufficiency); drugs (metformin, neomycin, alcohol); amyloid (p370).
- Bacterial overgrowth:20 spontaneous (esp. in elderly); in jejunal diverticula; post-op blind loops. DM & PPI use are also risk factors. Try metronidazole 400mg/8h PO. Don't confuse with afferent loop syndrome (p622).
- Infection: giardiasis; diphyllobothriasis (B12 malabsorption); strongyloidiasis.
- Intestinal hurry: post-gastrectomy dumping; post-vagotomy; gastrojejunostomy.

# Managing IBS

Make a positive diagnosis (p266) and other diagnoses, so:
- If the history is classic, FBC, ESR, CRP & coeliac serology (p266) are sufficient.
- If ≥60yrs or any marker or organic disease (T°, blood PR, ↓weight): colonoscopy.
- Have a low threshold for referring if family history of ovarian or bowel cancer.
- ♀: excluding ovarian cancer requires serum CA-125 (OHCS p281); endometriosis (OHCS p288) often mimics IBS: consider if pain cyclical.
- If IBS criteria not met, consider clinical context and decide upon: stool culture; B12/folate; TSH; faecal calprotectin (p262).

Refer if: 1 Diagnostic uncertainty (you or the patient!). 2 If changing symptoms in 'known IBS'. 3 Refractory to management: stress or depression (seen in ≥50%) or refractory symptoms (here, NICE favours cognitive therapy, OHCS p390), chronic pain overlap syndromes (fibromyalgia + chronic fatigue + chronic pelvic pain) or detrusor problems.

Treatment: Should focus on controlling symptoms, initially using lifestyle/dietary measures, then cognitive therapy (OHCS p390) or pharmacotherapy if required:
- Constipation: ensure adequate water and fibre intake and promote physical activity; (fibre intake can worsen flatulence/bloating so avoid insoluble fibre, such as bran; oats are better). Simple laxatives (p260, but beware lactulose which ferments and can aggravate bloating). If 2 of these fail, try prucalopride, linaclotide, or lubiprostone; or self-administered anal irrigation.
- Diarrhoea: avoid sorbitol sweeteners, alcohol, and caffeine; reduce dietary fibre content; encourage patients to identify their own 'trigger' foods; try a bulking agent ± loperamide 2mg after each loose stool.
- Colic/bloating: oral antispasmodics: mebeverine 135mg/8h or hyoscine butylbromide 10mg/8h (over the counter). Combination probiotics in sufficient doses (eg VSL#3®) may help flatulence or bloating. Diets low in fermentable, poorly absorbed saccharides and alcohols may provide benefit (the low FODMAP diet).
- Psychological symptoms/visceral hypersensitivity: emphasize the positive! You have excluded sinister pathology and over time, symptoms tend to improve. Consider cognitive behavioural therapy (OHCS p390), hypnosis, and tricyclics, eg amitriptyline 10–20mg at night (SE: drowsiness, dry mouth); explain that this is at a low dose for visceral pain (ie you are not prescribing the higher licensed dose for depression).

20 Bacterial overgrowth proximal to the colon causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vitamin malabsorption. Causes: old age, autonomic neuropathy (eg diabetic), ileocaecal valve resection; PPI usage; amyloidosis.
