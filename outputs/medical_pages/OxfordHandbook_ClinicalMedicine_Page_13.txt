'He who studies medicine without books sails an unchartered sea, but he who
studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all'
William Osler 1849-1919

The word 'patient' occurs frequently throughout this book.
Do not skim over it lightly.
Rather pause and doff your metaphorical cap, offering due respect to those
who by the opening up of their lives to you, become your true teachers.
Without your patients, you are a technician with a useless skill.
With them, you are a doctor.
