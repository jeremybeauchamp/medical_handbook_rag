# 486 Dementia

A neurodegenerative syndrome with progressive decline in several cognitive domains. The initial presentation is usually of memory loss over months or years (look for other causes if over days/weeks). Prevalence increases with age: 20% of people >80yrs are known to have dementia, yet probably only half of cases are diagnosed.

## Diagnosis
Is made by: *History* from the patient with a thorough collateral narrative—ask about the timeline of decline and the domains affected. Non-cognitive symptoms such as agitation, aggression, or apathy indicate late disease. *Cognitive testing*: Use a validated dementia screen such as the AMTS (p64) or similar, plus short tests of executive function and language. Carry out a mental state examination to identify anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. *Examination* may identify a physical cause, risk factors (eg for vascular dementia), or parkinsonism. *Medication review* is important to exclude drug-induced cognitive impairment.

## Investigations
Look for reversible/organic causes: TSH/B12/folate (treat low-normals, p334), thiamine (eg alcohol), ↑Ca2+. Check MSU, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFT, and glucose. An MRI (preferred to CT) can identify other reversible pathologies (eg subdural haematoma, p482; normal-pressure hydrocephalus¹¹), as well as underlying vascular damage or structural pathology. Functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT) may help delineate subtypes where diagnosis is not clear. Consider EEG in: suspected delirium, frontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check autoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic).

## Subtypes
- **Alzheimer's disease (AD)**: See p488.
- **Vascular dementia**: (~25%.) Cumulative effect of many small strokes: sudden onset and stepwise deterioration is characteristic (but often hard to recognize). Look for evidence of arteriopathy (↑BP, past strokes, focal CNS signs). Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or memantine in these patients.
- **Lewy body dementia**: (15-25%.) Fluctuating cognitive impairment, detailed visual hallucinations, and later, parkinsonism (p494). Histology is characterized by Lewy bodies (eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies) in brainstem and neocortex. Avoid using antipsychotics in Lewy body dementia (↑risk of SE, see p489).
- **Fronto-temporal dementia**: Frontal and temporal atrophy with loss of >70% of spindle neurons. Patients display executive impairment; behavioural/personality change; disinhibition; hyperorality, stereotyped behaviour, and emotional unconcern. Episodic memory and spatial orientation are preserved until later stages. Pick's disease refers to the few fronto-temporal dementia patients who have Pick inclusion bodies on histology (spherical clusters of tau-laden neurons).

## Other causes
Alcohol/drug abuse; repeated head trauma; pellagra (p268), Whipple's disease (p716); Huntington's (p702); CJD (p696); Parkinson's (p494); HIV; cryptococcosis (p408); familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer's; CADASIL (p470).

## Management
Refer suspected or diagnosed dementia to integrated memory services for further assessment and management. *Medication*: (p489). Avoid drugs that impair cognition (eg neuroleptics, sedatives, tricyclics). *Non-pharmacological interventions*: Non-cognitive symptoms (eg agitation) may respond to measures such as aromatherapy, multisensory stimulation, massage, music, and animal-assisted therapy.

## Other considerations
- **Depression**: Common. Try an SSRI (eg citalopram 10-20mg OD) or, if severe, mirtazapine (15-45mg at night if eGFR >40). Cognitive behavioural therapy can help with social withdrawal and catastrophic thinking.
- **Capacity**: Can the patient make decisions regarding medical or financial affairs? Wherever possible, allow them to. Suggest making an advanced directive or appointing a Lasting Power of Attorney in the early stages of the disease.
