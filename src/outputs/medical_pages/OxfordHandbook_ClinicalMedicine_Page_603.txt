# How to write up a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)

Variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) is more accurate a term than the previously used 'sliding scale'. Prescribe 50 units of short-acting insulin in 50mL of 0.9% saline to infuse at the rate shown in table 13.7 (according to blood glucose levels). NB: this is a guide onlyâ€”infusions may vary between institutions and no one infusion rate is suitable for all patients.

## Table 13.7 Guide to VRIII according to blood glucose levels

| Capillary blood glucose (mmol/L) | IV soluble insulin (rate of infusion) |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| <4.0                             | 0.5 units/h (0.0 if long-acting insulin continued) |
| 4.1-7.0                          | 1 unit/h |
| 7.1-9.0                          | 2 units/h |
| 9.1-11.0                         | 3 units/h |
| 11.1-14.0                        | 4 units/h |
| 14.1-17.0                        | 5 units/h |
| 17.1-20                          | 6 units/h |
| >20                              | 6 units/h; request urgent diabetic review |

Fluids should be prescribed to run with the VRIII (through the same cannula via a non-return valve). Ideally use 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% glucose and either 0.15% potassium chloride (KCl) (=20mmol/L) or 0.3% KCl (=40mmol/L). This provides a constant supply of substrate, but it is not widely available.

Alternatively, use 10% glucose + KCl. This has a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and hyponatraemia than 5% glucose. If capillary glucose >15mmol/L when starting the VRIII use 0.9% saline until <15mmol/L, then use 10% glucose.

Fluid should infuse at 83-125mL/h (ie 1L over 8-12 hours). Omit potassium if there is renal impairment or hyperkalaemia and slow the rate of infusion in heart failure.
