# 6 Bedside manner and communication skills

A good bedside manner is dynamic. It develops in the light of a patient's needs and is grounded in honesty, humour, and humility, in the presence of human weakness. But it is fragile: "It is unsettling to find how little it takes to defeat success in medicine... You do not imagine that a mere matter of etiquette could foil you. But the social dimension turns out to be as essential as the scientific... How each interaction is negotiated can determine whether a doctor is trusted, whether a patient is heard, whether the right diagnosis is made, the right treatment given. But in this realm there are no perfect formulas." (Atul Gawande, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance, 2008)

A patient may not care how much you know, until they know how much you care. Without care and trust, there can be little healing. Pre-set formulas offer, at best, a guide:

**Introduce yourself** every time you see a patient, giving your name and your role.
> "Introductions are about making a human connection between one human being who is suffering and vulnerable, and another human being who wishes to help. They begin therapeutic relationships and can instantly build trust"

**Be friendly.** Smile. Sit down. Take an interest in the patient and ask an unscripted question. Use the patient's name more than once.

**Listen.** Do not be the average physician who interrupts after 20-30 seconds.
> "Look wise, say nothing, and grunt. Speech was given to conceal thought."
> 
> William Osler (1849-1919).

**Increase the wait-time** between listening and speaking. The patient may say more.

**Pay attention to the non-verbal.** Observe gestures, body language, and eye contact. Be aware of your own.

**Explain.** Consider written or drawn explanations. When appropriate, include relatives in discussions to assist in understanding and recall.

**Adapt your language.** An explanation in fluent medicalese may mean nothing to your patient.

**Clarify understanding.** 'Acute', 'chronic', 'dizzy', 'jaundice', 'shock', 'malignant', 're-mission': do these words have the same meaning for both you and your patient?

**Be polite.** It requires no talent.
> "Politeness is prudence and consequently rudeness is folly. To make enemies by being...unnecessarily rude is as crazy as setting one's house on fire."
> 
> Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860).

**Address silent fears.** Give patients a chance to raise their concerns: 'What are you worried this might be?', 'Some people worry about...., does that worry you?'

**Consider the patient's disease model.** Patients may have their own explanations for their symptoms. Acknowledge their theories and, if appropriate, make an effort to explain why you think them unlikely.
> "A physician is obligated to consider more than a diseased organ, more even than the whole man - he must view the man in his world."
> 
> Harvey Cushing (1869-1939).

**Keep the patient informed.** Explain your working diagnosis and relate this to their understanding, beliefs, and concerns. Let them know what will happen next, and the likely timing. 'Soon' may mean a month to a doctor, but a day to a patient. Apologize for any delay.

**Summarize.** Is there anything you have missed?

Communication, partnership, and health promotion are improved when doctors are trained to KEPe Warm:

- **K**nowing—the patient's history, social talk.
- **E**ncouraging—back-channelling (hmmm, aahh).
- **P**hysically engaging—hand gestures, appropriate contact, lean in to the patient.
- **Warm up**—cooler, professional but supportive at the start of the consultation, making sure to avoid dominance, patronizing, and non-verbal cut-offs (ie turning away from the patient) at the end.
