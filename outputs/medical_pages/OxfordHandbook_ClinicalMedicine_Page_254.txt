# Diabetes insipidus (DI)

## Physiology
This is the passage of large volumes (>3L/day) of dilute urine due to impaired water resorption by the kidney, because of reduced ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary (cranial DI) or impaired response of the kidney to ADH (nephrogenic DI).

## Symptoms
Polyuria; polydipsia; dehydration; symptoms of hypernatraemia (p672). Polydipsia can be uncontrollable and all-consuming, with patients drinking anything and everything to hand: in such cases, if beer is on tap, disaster will ensue!

## Causes of cranial DI
- Idiopathic (≈50%)
- Congenital: defects in ADH gene, DIDMOAD¹⁶
- Tumour (may present with DI + hypopituitarism): craniopharyngioma, metastases, pituitary tumour
- Trauma: temporary if distal to pituitary stalk as proximal nerve endings grow out to find capillaries in scar tissue and begin direct secretion again
- Hypophysectomy
- Autoimmune hypophysitis (p232)
- Infiltration: histiocytosis, sarcoidosis¹⁷
- Vascular: haemorrhage¹⁸
- Infection: meningoencephalitis

## Causes of nephrogenic DI
- Inherited
- Metabolic: low potassium, high calcium
- Drugs: lithium, demeclocycline
- Chronic renal disease
- Post-obstructive uropathy

## Tests
U&E, Ca²⁺, glucose (exclude DM), serum and urine osmolalities. Serum osmolality estimate ≈ 2 × (Na⁺ + K⁺) + urea + glucose (all in mmol/L). Normal plasma osmolality is 285-295mOsmol/kg, and urine can be concentrated to more than twice this concentration. Significant DI is excluded if urine to plasma (U:P) osmolality ratio is more than 2:1, provided plasma osmolality is no greater than 295mOsmol/kg. In DI, despite raised plasma osmolality, urine is dilute with a U:P ratio <2. In primary polydipsia there may be dilutional hyponatraemia—and as hyponatraemia may itself cause mania, be cautious of saying 'It's water intoxication from psychogenic polydipsia'.

## Diagnosis
Water deprivation test: See BOX 'The 8-hour water deprivation test'. NB: it is often difficult to differentiate primary polydipsia from partial DI. ∆∆: DM; diuretics or lithium use; primary polydipsia causes symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria with dilute urine. Its cause is poorly understood;¹⁹ it may be associated with schizophrenia or mania (±Li⁺ therapy), or, rarely, hypothalamic disease (neurosarcoid; tumour; encephalitis; brain injury; HIV encephalopathy). As part of this syndrome, the kidneys may lose their ability to fully concentrate urine, due to a wash-out of the normal concentrating gradient in the renal medulla.

## Treatment
### Cranial DI:
MRI (head); test anterior pituitary function (p232). Give desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of ADH (eg Desmomelt® tablets).

### Nephrogenic:
Treat the cause. If it persists, try bendroflumethiazide 5mg PO/24h. NSAIDs lower urine volume and plasma Na⁺ by inhibiting prostaglandin synthase: prostaglandins locally inhibit the action of ADH.

## Emergency management
- Do urgent plasma U&E, and serum and urine osmolalities. Monitor urine output carefully and check U&E twice a day initially.
- IVI to keep up with urine output. If severe hypernatraemia, do not lower Na⁺ rapidly as this may cause cerebral oedema and brain injury. If Na⁺ is ≥170, use 0.9% saline initially—this contains 150mmol/L of sodium. Aim to reduce Na⁺ at a rate of less than 12mmol/L per day. Use of 0.45% saline can be dangerous.
- Desmopressin 2mcg IM (lasts 12-24h) may be used as a therapeutic trial.

¹⁶ DIDMOAD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder: Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy and Deafness (also known as Wolfram's syndrome).

¹⁷ Suspect neurosarcoidosis if CSF protein (seen in 34%), facial nerve palsy (25%), CSF pleocytosis (23%), diabetes insipidus (21%), hemiparesis (17%), psychosis (17%), papilloedema (15%), ataxia (13%), seizures (12%), optic atrophy (12%), hearing loss (12%), or nystagmus (9%).

¹⁸ Sheehan's syndrome is pituitary infarction from shock, eg postpartum haemorrhage. It is rare.

¹⁹ Most of us could drink 20L/d and not be hyponatraemic; some get hyponatraemic drinking 5L/d; they may have Psychosis, Intermittent hyponatraemia, and Polydipsia (PIP syndrome), ?from intravascular volume leading to atrial natriuretic peptide, p137, hence natriuresis and hyponatraemia.
