# The neurological examination in coma

This is aimed at locating the pathology in one of two places. Altered level of consciousness implies either:

1. A diffuse, bilateral, cortical dysfunction (usually producing loss of awareness with normal arousal), or
2. Damage to the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) located throughout the brainstem from the medulla to the thalami (usually producing loss of arousal with unassessable awareness). The brainstem can be affected directly (eg pontine haemorrhage) or indirectly (eg compression from transtentorial or cerebellar herniation secondary to a mass or oedema).

## Systematic examination:

- Level of consciousness; describe using objective words/AVPU.
- Respiratory pattern (p53)—Cheyne-Stokes (brainstem lesions or compression) hyperventilation (acidosis, hypoxia, or, rarely, neurogenic), ataxic or apneustic (breath-holding) breathing (brainstem damage with grave prognosis).
- Eyes—almost all patients with ARAS pathology will have eye findings:
  1. Visual fields—in light coma, test fields with visual threat. No blink in one field suggests hemianopia and contralateral hemisphere lesion.
  2. Pupils—normal direct and consensual reflexes present = intact midbrain. Midposition (3-5mm) non-reactive ± irregular = midbrain lesion. Unilateral dilated and unreactive ('fixed') = 3rd nerve compression. Small, reactive = pontine lesion ('pin-point pontine pupils') or drugs. Horner's syndrome (p702, fig 15.4) = ipsilateral lateral medulla or hypothalamus lesion, may precede uncal herniation. Beware patients with false eyes or who use eye drops for glaucoma.
  3. Extraocular movements (EOMS)—observe resting position and spontaneous movement; then test the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) with either the doll's-head manoeuvre (normal if the eyes keep looking at the same point in space when the head is quickly moved laterally or vertically) or ice water calorics (normal if eyes deviate towards the cold ear with nystagmus to the other side). If present, the VOR exonerates most of the brainstem from the VIIth nerve nucleus (medulla) to the IIIrd (midbrain). Don't move the head unless the cervical spine is cleared.
  4. Fundi—papilloedema, subhyaloid haemorrhage, hypertensive retinopathy, signs of other disease (eg diabetic retinopathy).
- Examine for CNS asymmetry (tone, spontaneous movements, reflexes). One way to test for hemiplegia in coma is to raise both arms together and compare how they fall under gravity. If one descends fast, like a lead weight, but the other descends more gracefully, you have found a valuable focal sign of cortical dysfunction. The same applies to the legs.
