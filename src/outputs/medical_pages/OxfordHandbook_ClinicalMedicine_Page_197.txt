*Available as a Turbohaler®; Autohalers® are an alternative (breath-actuated) and don't need breathing coordination, eg Airomir® (salbutamol) and Qvar® (beclometasone). Accuhalers® deliver dry powders (eg Flixotide®, Serevent®).

Systemic absorption (via the throat) is less if inhalation is through a large-volume device, eg Volumatic® or AeroChamber Plus® devices. The latter is more compact. Static charge on some devices reduces dose delivery, so wash in water before dose; leave to dry (don't rub). It's pointless to squirt many puffs into a device: it is best to repeat single doses, and be sure to inhale as soon as the drug is in the spacer. SE: local (oral) candidiasis (p377); ↑rate of cataract if lifetime dose ≥2g beclometasone.37

Prescribe beclometasone by brand name, and state that a CFC-free inhaler should be dispensed. This is because, dose for dose, Qvar® is twice as potent as the other available CFC-free brand (Clenil Modulite®).

Any dose ≥250mcg ≈ significant steroid absorption: carry a steroid card; this recommendation is being widened, and lower doses (beclometasone) are now said to merit a steroid card (manufacturer's information).
