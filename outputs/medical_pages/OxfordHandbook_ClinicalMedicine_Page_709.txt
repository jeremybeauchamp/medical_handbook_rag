## Barrett's oesophagus

Barrett's oesophagus is metaplasia of the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the distal oesophagus to a columnar epithelium, as a result of chronic GORD (p254). Estimates of prevalence vary widely, but in patients with a history of symptomatic GORD, rates of ≈8% have been reported. Importantly, screening studies in asympto-matic individuals have reported rates of ≈6%. General population-based screening is not recommended, although screening endoscopy may be considered in individuals with chronic GORD symptoms and multiple risk factors (>50 years old, obesity, ♂, white race, family history of Barrett's or oesophageal adenocarcinoma). Diagnosis: Biopsy of endoscopically visible columnarization allows histological corroboration. The length should be recorded (using the Prague classification). Management: 

▶Focus on detecting and preventing the most significant associated morbidity: oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of progression is low (0.1–0.4% per patient per year, much lower than previously suggested). Risk factors for malignant trans-formation include age, ♂, long segment of oesophagus involved, and evidence of dysplasia. Endoscopic surveillance for dysplasia is controversial and the evidence base is lacking. Current guidelines suggest that patients without dysplasia and in whom the length of involved oesophagus is <3cm should be considered for discharge from surveillance programmes, depending on the precise histology.⁸ For those with more extensive disease, endoscopic assessment every 2–3 years is appropriate. If high-grade dysplasia or intramural carcinoma is detected, endoscopic resection or mucosal radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended. If low-grade dysplasia is detected, it should be confirmed by repeat examination after 6 months and by an independent pathologist, prior to RFA.⁹

## Brugada syndrome

Note right bundle branch block and the unusual morphology of the raised ST segments in V₁–V₃ (fig 15.2; there are three ECG variants of this pattern). This predominently autosomal domi-nant condition causing faulty sodium channels predisposes to fatal arrhythmias (eg ventricular fibrillation), typically in young males (eg trig-gered by a fever).¹⁰ It is preventable by implant-ing a defibrillator. ▶Consider primary electrical cardiac disease in all with unexplained syn-cope. Programmed electrical stimulation may be needed. Relatives of those with sudden unexplained death may undergo unmasking of arrhythmias by IV ajmaline tests—but some re-sults are false +ve. Use judgement in subjecting those with ST abnormalities but no symptoms to electrophysiological tests, right ventric-ular myocardial biopsy, and MRI. Mutations in the SCN5A gene (encodes the cardiac voltage-gated Nav1.5 channel) are found in 15–20%. Other mutations have also been described.¹¹
