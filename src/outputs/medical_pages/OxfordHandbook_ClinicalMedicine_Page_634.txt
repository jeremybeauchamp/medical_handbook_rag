# 620 Bowel ischaemia

There are three main types of bowel ischaemia: ▶AF with abdominal pain should always prompt thoughts of mesenteric ischaemia.

## 1 Acute mesenteric ischaemia
Almost always involves the small bowel and may follow superior mesenteric artery (SMA; fig 13.36) thrombosis (~35%) or embolism (~35%), mesenteric vein thrombosis (~5%; younger patients with hypercoagulable states—tends to affect smaller lengths of bowel), or non-occlusive disease (~20%; occurs in low-flow states and usually reflects poor cardiac output, though there may be other factors such as recent cardiac surgery or renal failure). Other causes include trauma, vasculitis (p556), radiotherapy, or strangulation (volvulus or hernia, p612).

Presentation is a classical clinical triad: ▶acute severe abdominal pain; no/minimal abdominal signs; rapid hypovolaemia→shock. Pain tends to be constant, central, or around the RIF. The degree of illness is often far out of proportion with clinical signs.

Tests: There may be ↑Hb (due to plasma loss), ↑WCC, modestly raised plasma amylase, and a persistent metabolic acidosis (high lactate). Early on, the abdominal x-ray shows a 'gasless' abdomen. CT/MR may show evidence of ischaemia with CT/MR angiography or formal arteriography if doubt remains. Often the diagnosis is made on finding a nasty, necrotic bowel at laparotomy.

Treatment: The main life-threatening complications secondary to acute mesenteric ischaemia are 1 septic peritonitis and 2 progression of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to multi-organ failure, mediated by bacterial translocation across the dying gut wall. Resuscitation with fluid, antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam, see table 9.3, p386), and, usually, LMWH/heparin are required. If arteriography is done, thrombolytics may be infused locally via the catheter. At surgery, dead bowel must be removed. Revascularization may be attempted on potentially viable bowel but it is a difficult process and often needs a 2nd laparotomy.

Prognosis: Poor for arterial thrombosis and non-occlusive disease (<40% survive), though not so bad for venous and embolic ischaemia.

## 2 Chronic mesenteric ischaemia
(AKA intestinal angina.) The triad of severe, colicky post-prandial abdominal pain ('gut claudication'), ↓weight (eating hurts), and an upper abdominal bruit may be present ± PR bleeding, malabsorption, and N&V. Typically brought about through a combination of a low-flow state with atheroma (95% due to diffuse atherosclerotic disease in all three mesenteric arteries). It is rare and difficult to diagnose. Tests: CT angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography are replacing traditional angiography. Treatment: Once diagnosis is confirmed, surgery should be considered due to the ongoing risk of acute infarction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent insertion has replaced open revascularization. It is associated with less post-operative morbidity and mortality, but has higher restenosis rates.

## 3 Chronic colonic ischaemia
(AKA ischaemic colitis) usually follows low flow in the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) territory and ranges from mild ischaemia to gangrenous colitis. Presentation: Lower left-sided abdominal pain ± bloody diarrhoea. Tests: CT may be helpful but lower GI endoscopy is 'gold-standard'. Treatment: Usually conservative with fluid replacement and antibiotics. Most recover but subsequent development of ischaemic strictures is common. Gangrenous ischaemic colitis (presenting with peritonitis and hypovolaemic shock) requires prompt resuscitation followed by resection of the affected bowel and stoma formation. Mortality is high.
