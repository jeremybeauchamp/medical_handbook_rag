## Carpal tunnel syndrome: the commonest mononeuropathy

The median nerve and nine tendons compete for space within the wrist. Compression is common, especially in women who have narrower wrists but similar-sized tendons to men.

**Clinical features:** Aching pain in the hand and arm (especially at night), and paraesthesiae in thumb, index, and middle fingers: relieved by dangling the hand over the edge of the bed and shaking it (remember 'wake and shake'). There may be sensory loss and weakness of abductor pollicis brevis ± wasting of the thenar eminence. Light touch, 2-point discrimination, and sweating may be impaired.

**Causes:** Anything causing swelling or compression of the tunnel: myxoedema; prolonged flexion (eg in a Colles' splint); acromegaly; myeloma; local tumours (lipomas, ganglia); rheumatoid arthritis; amyloidosis; pregnancy; sarcoidosis.

**Tests:** Neurophysiology helps by confirming the lesion's site and severity (and likelihood of improvement after surgery). Maximal wrist flexion for 1 min (Phalen's test) may elicit symptoms, and tapping over the nerve at the wrist can induce tingling (Tinel's test) but both are rather non-specific.

**Treatment:** Splinting, local steroid injection ± decompression surgery.

**NB:** There is also tarsal tunnel syndrome: unilateral burning sole pain following tibial nerve compression.

## Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments

The ulnar nerve asks for trouble in at least five places at the elbow, starting proximally at the arcade of Struthers (a musculofascial band ~8cm proximal to the medial epicondyle), and ending distally where it exits the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle in the forearm. Most often, compression occurs at the epicondylar groove or at the point where the nerve passes between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris (true cubital tunnel syndrome). Trauma can easily damage the nerve against its bony confines (the medial condyle of the humerus—the 'funny bone'). Normally, stretch and compression forces on the ulnar nerve at the elbow are moderated by its ability to glide in its groove. When normal excursion is restricted, irritation ensues. This may cause a vicious cycle of perineural scarring, consequent loss of excursion, and progressive symptoms—without antecedent trauma. Compressive ulnar neuropathies at the wrist (Guyon's canal—between the pisiform and hamate bones) are less common, but they can also result in disability.

**Treatment** centres on rest and avoiding pressure on the nerve, but if symptoms continue, night-time soft elbow splinting (to prevent flexion >60°) is warranted. A splint for the hand may help prevent permanent clawing of the fingers. For chronic neuropathy associated with weakness, or if splinting fails, a variety of surgical procedures have been tried. For moderately severe neuropathies, decompressions in situ may help, but often fail. Medial epicondylectomies are effective in ≈50% (but many will recur). Subcutaneous nerve re-routing (transposition) may be tried.
