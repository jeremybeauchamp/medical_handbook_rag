# 206 Diabetes mellitus (DM): classification and diagnosis

DM results from lack, or reduced effectiveness, of endogenous insulin. Hyperglycaemia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems: stroke, MI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia. So think of DM as a vascular disease:¹ adopt a holistic approach and consider other cardiovascular risk factors too.

## Categories of diabetes and dyslipidaemia

### Type 1 DM: 
Usually adolescent onset but may occur at any age. Cause: insulin deficiency from autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells. Patients must have insulin, and are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss. Associated with other autoimmune diseases (>90% HLA DR3 ± DR4). Concordance is only ~30% in identical twins, indicating environmental influence. Four genes are important: one (6q) determines islet sensitivity to damage (eg from viruses or cross-reactivity from cows' milk-induced antibodies). Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.

### Type 2 DM: 
(Formerly non-insulin-dependent DM, NIDDM) is at 'epidemic' levels in many places, mainly due to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and improved longevity.⁴ Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%). Most are over 40yrs, but teenagers are now getting type 2 DM (OHCS p156). Cause: insulin secretion ± insulin resistance. It is associated with obesity, lack of exercise, calorie and alcohol excess. ~80% concordance in identical twins, indicating stronger genetic influence than in type 1 DM. Typically progresses from a preliminary phase of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). (► This is a unique window for lifestyle intervention.) Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM affecting young people.

### Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): 
Fasting plasma glucose <7mmol/L and OGTT (oral glucose tolerance) 2h glucose ≥7.8mmol/L but <11.1mmol/L.

### Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): 
Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1mmol/L but <7mmol/L (WHO criteria). Do an OGTT to exclude DM. The cut-off point is somewhat arbitrary. IGT and IFG denote different abnormalities of glucose regulation (post-prandial and fasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both with lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG and HbA1C at high end of normal (37–46mmol/mol) is ~25%.⁵

### Other causes of DM 
► Steroids; anti-HIV drugs; newer antipsychotics.
- Pancreatic: pancreatitis; surgery (where >90% pancreas is removed); trauma; pancreatic destruction (haemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis); pancreatic cancer.
- Cushing's disease; acromegaly; phaeochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; pregnancy.
- Others: congenital lipodystrophy; glycogen storage diseases.

### Metabolic syndrome (syndrome x) 
Definition from International Diabetes Federation: central obesity (BMI >30, or waist circ, ethnic-specific values), plus two of BP ≥130/85, triglycerides ≥1.7mmol/L, HDL ≤1.03/1.29mmol/L, fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or type 2 DM. ~20% are affected; weight, genetics, and insulin resistance important in aetiology. Vascular events—but probably not beyond the combined effect of individual risk factors. ℞: Exercise; weight; treat individual components.

¹ Chicken or egg? Most type 2 diabetes-associated genes have a function in the vasculature, and stress in β-cells can result from vascular defects in the pancreas, so maybe vascular events trigger DM.⁶
