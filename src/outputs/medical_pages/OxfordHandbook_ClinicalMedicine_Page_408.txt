# Tuberculosis (TB): diagnosis and treatment

## Diagnostic tests for TB

### Latent TB:
Offer testing³ to close contacts of those with pulmonary or laryngeal TB, those with immune dysfunction, healthcare workers, and high-risk populations, eg prison, homeless, vulnerable migrants.

- **Tuberculin skin testing (TST)** = Mantoux test. Intradermal injection of purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin. Size of skin induration is used to determine positivity depending on vaccination history and immune status (>5mm if risk factors, >15mm if no risk factors).
- **Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)** diagnose exposure to TB by measuring the release of interferon-gamma from T-cells reacting to TB antigen. ↑Specificity compared to TST if history of BCG vaccination.

> Neither test can diagnose or exclude active disease (falsely negative in 20-25% of active disease): clinical evaluation is required.
> Immune-suppressed states reduce the sensitivity of both tests.

### Active pulmonary TB:
- **CXR.** Fibronodular/linear opacities in upper lobe (typical), middle or lower lobes (atypical), cavitation, calcification, miliary disease (see fig 9.9), effusion, lymphadenopathy.
- **Sputum smear.** Sputum can be spontaneously produced or induced (with nebulized saline and precautions to prevent transmission). Three specimens are needed including an early-morning sample. It is stained for the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). All mycobacteria are 'acid-fast' including M. tuberculosis. If AFB are seen, treatment should be commenced and the patient isolated (in hospital only if clinical indication, or public health reason for admission; or at home).
- **Sputum culture.** More sensitive than smear testing. Culture takes 1-3 weeks (liquid media) or 4-8 weeks (solid media). Can assess drug sensitivity.
- **Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT).** Direct detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum by DNA or RNA amplification. Rapid diagnosis (<8hrs). Can also detect drug resistance (see p395).

### Extra-pulmonary TB:
- Investigate for coexisting pulmonary disease.
- Obtain material from aspiration or biopsy (lymph node, pleura, bone, synovium, GI/GU tract) to enable AFB staining, histological examination (caseating granuloma) and/or culture.
- NAAT can be carried out on any sterile body fluid, eg CSF, pericardial fluid.

>> Offer HIV test for all.

## Treatment
Antibiotics used in the treatment³ of TB are detailed in table 9.10.

### Table 9.10 Antibiotics used in the treatment of TB

| Antibiotic    | Standard course for active disease | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Rifampicin    | 2 months intensive<br>4 months continuation | Enzyme inducer: care with warfarin, calcineurin inhibitors, oestrogens, phenytoin; body secretions coloured orange-red (includes contact lens staining); altered liver function. |
| Isoniazid     | 2 months intensive<br>4 months continuation | Inhibits formation of active pyridoxine (Vit B₆) which causes a peripheral neuropathy (↑risk with DM, CKD, HIV, malnutrition) ∴ give with prophylactic pyridoxine; hepatitis. |
| Pyrazinamide  | 2 months intensive | Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity, ↓dose if eGFR<30. |
| Ethambutol    | 2 months intensive | Colour blindness, visual acuity, optic neuritis. Check visual acuity at start of treatment, monitor for symptoms. Monthly visual check if treatment > 2 months. Monitor levels if eGFR<30. |
