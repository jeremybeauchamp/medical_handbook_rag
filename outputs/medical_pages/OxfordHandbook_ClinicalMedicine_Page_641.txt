The image shows three diagrams illustrating different surgical procedures for the stomach:

1. Adjustable gastric band: This procedure involves placing an adjustable band around the upper part of the stomach, creating a small pouch. The band is connected to a subcutaneous access port.

2. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy: This procedure involves removing a large portion of the stomach, leaving a narrow "sleeve" or tube-shaped stomach.

3. Gastric bypass: This more complex procedure creates a small proximal pouch of the stomach, bypasses the distal stomach, and connects the pouch directly to a part of the small intestine (Roux limb). The duodenum is preserved to transport bile and pancreatic fluids.

These diagrams are labeled to show the relevant anatomical structures and surgical modifications for each procedure.
