# The respiratory system: examination 1

Begin by introducing yourself, obtaining consent to examine and position the patient appropriately: lying on a bed, sitting up at 45°. Expose them to the waist (for female patients, delay until examining the chest). Explain what you are doing throughout.

## 1 General inspection
- Assess general state (ill/well/cachexic)
- Look for clues (oxygen, inhalers, nebulizers, venturi mask)
- Colour (pale, cyanosed (fig 2.15), flushed)
- Short of breath? Accessory muscle use?
- Scars on chest wall?
Ask the patient to take a deep breath in, watch chest movement and symmetry, any coughing?

## 2 Hands
- Inspect:
  Tobacco staining (fig 2.16), peripheral cyanosis, clubbing, signs of systemic disease (systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis)
- Asterixis:
  Ask the patient to hold their hands out and cock their wrists back

## 3 Arms
- Time pulse rate, with fingers still on the pulse, check respiratory rate (this can increase if the patient is aware you are timing it)—and pattern (p53)
- Bounding pulse (CO₂ retention)?
- Check blood pressure

## 4 Neck
- Trachea: Feel in sternal notch (fig 2.17, deviated?), assess cricosternal distance in finger-breadths and feel for tracheal tug
- Lymphadenopathy: From behind with patient sat forward palpate lymph nodes of head and neck
- JVP: Raised in cor pulmonale, fixed and raised in superior vena cava obstruction

## 5 Face
- Inspect: For signs of Horner's (fig 2.18), conjunctival pallor, central cyanosis (ask patient to stick out tongue), pursed lip breathing
