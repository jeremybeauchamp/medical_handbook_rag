# Drug therapeutic ranges in plasma

- Ranges should only be used as a guide to treatment. A drug in an apparently too low concentration may still be clinically useful, while some patients require (and tolerate) levels in the 'toxic' range.
- The time since the last dose should be specified on the request form.

**Amikacin¹:** Peak (1h post IV dose): 20-30mg/L. Trough: <10mg/L.

**Carbamazepine¹:** Optimal concentration: 20-50μmol/L (4-12mg/L).

**Digoxin¹** (6-12h post dose) 1-2.6nmol/L (0.8-2mcg/L). <1.3nmol/L may be toxic if there is hypokalaemia. Signs of toxicity—CVS: arrhythmias, heart block. CNS: confusion, insomnia, agitation, seeing too much yellow (xanthopsia), delirium. GI: nausea.

**Gentamicin¹²** (p387) and **tobramycin¹²:** The potential for oto- and nephrotoxicity is high if aminoglycosides are used inappropriately, so only prescribe for short therapeutic courses and follow local expert advice/guidelines. CI in severe renal or liver failure, ascites, burns, high cardiac output states (eg anaemia, Paget's disease), children, and pregnancy. Signs of toxicity: tinnitus, deafness, nystagmus, vertigo, renal failure. Once-daily dosing with dose adjustment is prefered as this has fewer SEs and better bactericidal activity (eg gentamicin 5mg/kg/d or tobramycin 4mg/kg/d; check with pharmacist in obese patients or when using tobramycin in cystic fibrosis). An exception to this dosing is endocarditis: split dosing (eg gentamicin 1mg/kg/8h or 12-hourly in renal failure) increases the synergistic bactericidal effect of other agents. Trough (just before dose) levels and renal function should initially be monitored daily (can be twice weekly in stable patients with normal renal function)—aim for trough: <1mg/L for both gentamicin and tobramycin. If the trough level is out of range, withold the next dose until level <1mg/L (recheck after 12-24h).

**Lithium²** (12h post dose). Guidelines vary: 0.4-0.8mmol/L is reasonable. Early signs of toxicity (Li⁺ >1.5mmol/L): tremor. Intermediate: lethargy. Late: (Li⁺ >2mmol/L) spasms, coma, fits, arrhythmias, renal failure (haemodialysis may be needed). See OHCS p349.

**Phenytoin¹²:** Trough: 40-80μmol/L (10-20mg/L). Beware if ↑albumin, as the assay is for bound phenytoin, while it is free phenytoin that is pharmacologically important. Signs of toxicity: ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus, sedation, dysarthria.

**Theophylline** 10-20mg/mL (55-110μmol/L). (See p810.) Take sample 4-6h after starting an infusion (which should be stopped for ~15min just before the specimen is taken). Signs of toxicity: arrhythmias, anxiety, tremor, convulsions.

**Vancomycin¹²:** Renally excreted; dosing guided by age and renal function but typically 500mg-1g/12h. Check trough levels prior to 3rd dose, aiming for: 5-10 mg/L (10-15mg/L in SBE/IE and less-sensitive MRSA infections). If levels too low check drug being given then cautiously increase dose; if levels high then confirm timing of dose/levels, omit next dose, recheck levels, and consider decreasing dose or frequency.

¹ Trough levels should be taken just before the next dose. If values abnormally high, check that sample was indeed a trough level and not taken post-dose.
² Drugs for which routine monitoring is indicated.
