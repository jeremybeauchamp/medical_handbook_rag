# Myocardial perfusion imaging

A non-invasive method of assessing regional myocardial blood flow and the cellular integrity of myocytes. The technique uses radionuclide tracers which cross the myocyte membrane and are trapped intracellularly. Thallium-201 ($$^{201}$$Tl), a K+ analogue, is distributed via regional myocardial blood flow and requires cellular integrity for uptake. Newer technetium-99 ($$^{99}$$Tc)-based agents are similar to $$^{201}$$Tl but have improved imaging characteristics, and can be used to assess myocardial perfusion and LV performance in the same study (fig 16.30).

Myocardial territories supplied by unobstructed coronary vessels have normal perfusion whereas regions supplied by stenosed coronary vessels have poorer relative perfusion, a difference that is accentuated by exercise. For this reason, exercise tests are used in conjunction with radionuclide imaging to identify areas at risk of ischaemia/infarction. Exercise scans are compared with resting views: *reversible* (ischaemia) or *fixed defects* (infarct) can be seen and the coronary artery involved reliably predicted. Drugs (eg adenosine, dobutamine, and dipyridamole) can also be used to induce perfusion differences between normal and underperfused tissues.

Myocardial perfusion imaging adds information in patients presenting with acute MI (to determine the amount of myocardium salvaged by thrombolysis) and in diagnosing acute chest pain in those without classical ECG changes (to define the presence of significant perfusion defects).

Fig 16.30 $$^{99}$$Tc perfusion study showing perfusion defect in the left ventricle anterior and lateral walls at stress which is partially reversible (difference between stress and rest images). This study is good for small vessel disease such as in diabetes; CT and coronary angiography do not show small vessel disease well.
