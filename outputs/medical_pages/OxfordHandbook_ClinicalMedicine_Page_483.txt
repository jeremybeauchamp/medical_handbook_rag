# Dystonia

Dystonia describes prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal posture or repetitive movements.

## Idiopathic generalized dystonia:
Childhood-onset dystonia often starting in one leg with ipsilateral progression over 5â€“10yrs. Autosomal dominant inheritance is common (DYT1 deletion). Exclude Wilson's disease and dopa-responsive dystonia (needs an L-dopa trial). Anticholinergics and muscle relaxants may help. Deep brain stimulation for refractory, disabling symptoms.

## Focal dystonias:
Confined to one part of the body, eg spasmodic torticollis (head pulled to one side), blepharospasm (involuntary contraction of orbicularis oculi, OHCS p417), writer's cramp. Focal dystonias in adults are typically idiopathic, and rarely generalize. They are worsened by stress. Patients may develop a geste antagoniste to try to resist the dystonic posturing (eg a touch of the finger to the jaw in spasmodic torticollis). Injection of botulinum toxin into the overactive muscles is usually effective.

## Acute dystonia:
(fig 10.14) May occur on starting many drugs, including neuroleptics and some anti-emetics (eg metoclopramide, cyclizine). There is torticollis (head pulled back), trismus (oromandibular spasm), and/or oculogyric crisis (eyes drawn up). You may mistake this for tetanus or meningitis, but such reactions rapidly disappear after a dose of an anticholinergic, see p843.

The image shows three photographs of a person exhibiting symptoms of oromandibular/oculogyric crisis in acute dystonia. The images display different facial expressions and eye positions characteristic of this condition.

# St Vitus's dance

Throughout the middle ages, Europe was plagued by epidemics of 'dancing mania', in which afflicted individuals were described to have danced wildly, displaying strange contortions and convulsions until they collapsed from exhaustion. If the afflicted touched a relic of St Vitus they were miraculously cured; observing this, Paracelsus, 16th-century Swiss-German physician and philosopher, described the phenomenon of chorea Sancti Viti ('St Vitus's dance'). There may have been an infectious component, although mass hysteria induced by religious cults that swept across medieval Europe seems a more likely cause. Chorea was subsequently used as a general term for large-amplitude involuntary movements before being further refined by physicians such as Sydenham (though he did not connect his eponymous chorea seen in rheumatic fever with an infectious trigger) and Charcot. Nowaways, a more frequent cause of involuntary movements with behavioural disturbance is NMDA-receptor antibody encephalitis, the impact of which was documented in Susannah Cahalan's excellent 2012 autobiography Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness.
