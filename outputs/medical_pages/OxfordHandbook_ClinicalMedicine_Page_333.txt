## Analgesic nephropathy
Caused by NSAIDs, aspirin, paracetamol. ↓Prevalence since phenacetin withdrawn. Risk determined by frequency and duration of use. Presentation: History of chronic pain (headache, musculoskeletal). Often silent until advanced CKD. Diagnosis: Urinalysis: normal or sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria. USS: small and irregular kidneys. IVU: classic 'cup and spill' appearance. Non-contrast CT: ↓renal mass, papillary calcification. Biopsy: CTIN secondary to papillary necrosis. ↑Risk of atherosclerosis. Treatment: Discontinue analgesia. Manage CKD (pp304-5). USS or CT urogram if sudden flank pain to exclude obstruction from sloughed papilla.

## Aminoglycosides (gentamicin >tobramycin >amikacin >streptomycin)
Cause AKI due to tubular necrosis. Risk factors: ↑dose, prolonged use, CKD, volume depletion, other nephrotoxins. Presentation: Typically mild, non-oliguric AKI after 1-2 weeks of therapy. Recovery can be delayed/incomplete. Treatment: Prevention. Single daily dose may be less nephrotoxic ▶Check levels (p756).

## Radiocontrast nephropathy
AKI 48-72 hours after IV contrast. Risk factors: CKD, DM, ↑dose of contrast, volume depletion, other nephrotoxins. Treatment: None. ▶Prevention is key: pre-hydrate with IV cystalloid (no consistent benefit shown for bicarbonate above 0.9% sodium chloride). Use local protocol or consider 3mL/kg/h 1 hour before, and 1mL/kg/h for 6h after. Acetylcysteine evidence is weak. Discontinue other nephrotoxic medication for 24h pre- and post-procedure. Tell the radiologist about risk factors so they can use the lowest dose of low/iso-osmolar contrast.

## Rhabdomyolysis
Results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of intracellular contents (K+, myoglobin) into the extracellular space. ↑Cytokines and ↓nitric oxide cause renal vasoconstriction. Myoglobin is filtered by the glomeruli causing obstruction and inflammation. Presentation: History of trauma, surgery, immobility, hyperthermia, seizures. Muscle pain, swelling, tenderness. AKI. Red-brown urine. Diagnosis: Serum myoglobin: short half-life, may be missed. Plasma CK ×5 upper limit. Myoglobinuria (tea- or cola-coloured urine) is falsely +ve for blood on dipstick with no RBC seen on microscopy. ↑K+, ↑PO43−, ↓Ca2+. Treatment: Supportive. Urgent treatment for hyperkalaemia (p301). IV fluid rehydration: maintain urine output 300mL/h until myoglobinuria has ceased; up to 1.5L fluid/h may be needed. If oliguric, monitor CVP in HDU/ICU setting. Renal replacement may be needed. (Alkalinization of urine hypothesized to ↓crystallization and toxic metabolites but no RCT evidence to support use over other crystalloids and beware ↓Ca2+.)

## Urate nephropathy
In acute crystal nephropathy, uric acid crystals precipitate within the tubulointerstitium causing ↓GFR and secondary inflammation. Seen in tumour lysis syndrome when a high tumour burden and sensitivity to chemotherapy cause ↑uric acid which precipitates in association with phosphate. In addition, serum uric acid is a risk factor for CKD: hypothesized stimulus for arterial disease with pathological autoregulation of renal blood flow, renin, and ↑BP. Treatment: Tumour lysis: aggressive hydration, allopurinol/rasburicase to ↓synthesis of uric acid. Chronic disease: unclear whether diet/treatment to ↓uric acid (allopurinol, febuxostat) improves outcome.

## Radiation nephritis
Renal impairment due to ionizing radiation. Presents 6 months-years after total body irradiation, local field radiotherapy, or targeted radionucleotide therapy. Presents with ↑BP, proteinuria/haematuria, progression to renal failure. Prognosis linked to ↑BP. Treatment: ↓Radiation dose with shielding. As CKD (pp304-5) with strict BP control.

## Aristolochic acid nephropathy
Herbal remedies containing aristolochic acid can cause progressive CKD. Disproportionate anaemia, mild proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Biopsy: extensive fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Risk of urothelial malignancy ×5, occurs in up to 40%. Aristolochic acid thought to be underlying cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy: cluster of CKD/renal failure in Balkan areas where aristolochic acid is detected in wheat. Treatment: Avoid exposure. Treat as CKD (pp304-5). Screen for malignancy. Consider therapeutic trial of steroids (limited data).
