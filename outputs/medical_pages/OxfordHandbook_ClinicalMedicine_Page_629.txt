### The contents of the inguinal canal in the male

- The external spermatic fascia (from external oblique), cremasteric fascia (from internal oblique and transverses abdominus), and internal spermatic fascia (from transversalis fascia) covering the cord.
- The spermatic cord:
  - Vas deferens, obliterated processus vaginalis, and lymphatics.
  - Arteries to the vas, cremaster, and testis.
  - The pampiniform plexus and the venous equivalent of the above.
  - The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve and sympathetic nerves.
- The ilioinguinal nerve, which enters the inguinal canal via the anterior wall and runs anteriorly to the cord.

NB: in the female the round ligament of the uterus is in place of the male structures. A hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is the female equivalent of a hydrocele of the cord.
