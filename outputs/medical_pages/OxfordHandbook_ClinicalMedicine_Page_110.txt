## ECG—a methodical approach

### Reading an ECG

First confirm the patient's name and age, and the ECG date. Then (see fig 3.3):

- **Rate**: At usual speed (25mm/s) each 'big square' is 0.2s; each 'small square' is 0.04s. To calculate the rate, divide 300 by the number of big squares between two consecutive R waves (table 3.1). The normal rate is 60-100bpm.

- **Rhythm**: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the 'card method': lay a card along the ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card to and fro to check that all intervals are equal. If they are not, note if:
  - there is slight but regular lengthening and then shortening (with respiration)— sinus arrhythmia, common in the young
  - there are different rates which are multiples of each other—varying block
  - it is 100% irregular—atrial fibrillation (AF) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).

  Sinus rhythm is characterized by a P wave followed by a QRS complex. AF has no discernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular. Atrial flutter (p130, fig 3.35 p131) has a 'sawtooth' baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular QRS complexes. Ventricular rhythm has QRS complexes >0.12s with P waves following them or absent (fig 3.12, p106).

- **Axis**: The overall direction of depolarization across the patient's anterior chest; this is the sum of all the ventricular electrical forces during ventricular depolarization. See BOX 'Determining the ECG axis'. Left axis deviation can result from left anterior hemiblock, inferior MI, VT from a left ventricular focus, WPW, LVH. Right axis deviation can result from RVH, PE, anterolateral MI, WPW and left posterior hemiblock.

- **P wave**: Normally precedes each QRS complex, and upright in II, III, & aVF but inverted in aVR. Absent P wave: AF, P hidden due to junctional or ventricular rhythm. P mitrale: bifid P wave, indicates left atrial hypertrophy. P pulmonale: peaked P wave, indicates right atrial hypertrophy. Pseudo-P-pulmonale seen if K+↓.

- **PR interval**: Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS. Normal range: 0.12-0.2s (3-5 small squares). A prolonged PR interval implies delayed AV conduction (1st degree heart block). A short PR interval implies unusually fast AV conduction down an accessory pathway, eg WPW (see fig 3.37, p133). See heart block, p98.

**Fig 3.2** 'QRS' complexes. If the first deflection from the isoelectric line is negative, it is a Q wave. Any positive deflection is an R wave. Any negative deflection after an R is an S.

- **QRS complex**: See fig 3.2. Normal duration: <0.12s. QRS >0.12s suggests ventricular conduction defects, eg a bundle branch block (pp99, 100), metabolic disturbance, or ventricular origin (eg ventricular ectopic). High-amplitude QRS complexes suggest ventricular hypertrophy (p100). Normal Q waves are <0.04s wide and <2mm deep; they are often seen in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 and reflect normal septal depolarization. Pathological Q waves (deep and wide) may occur within a few hours of an acute MI.

- **QT interval**: Measure from start of QRS to end of T wave. It varies with rate. The corrected QT interval (QTc) is the QT interval divided by the square root of the R-R interval, ie QTc=QT/√RR. Normal QTc: 0.38-0.42s. For causes of prolonged QT interval see p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death.

- **ST segment**: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usually implies infarction (p119, figs 3.9, 3.10, pp103-4) or ischaemia, respectively.

- **T wave**: Normally inverted in aVR, V1, and occasionally V2. Normal if inverted in isolation in lead III. Abnormal if inverted in I, II, and V4-V6. Peaked in hyperkalaemia (fig 14.4, p675) and flattened in hypokalaemia.

- **J wave**: See p849. The J point is where the S wave finishes and ST segment starts. A J wave is a notch at this point. Seen in hypothermia, SAH, and ↑Ca2+.
