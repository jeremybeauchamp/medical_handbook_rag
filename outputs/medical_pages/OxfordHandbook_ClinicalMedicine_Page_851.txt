# Phaeochromocytoma emergencies

Patients with phaeochromocytoma may have had undiagnosed symptoms for some time, but stress, abdominal palpation, parturition, general anaesthetic, or contrast media used in imaging can cause acute hypertensive crises.

**Signs and symptoms** Pallor, pulsating headache, hypertension, feels 'about to die', pyrexial. ECG: signs of LVF, ↑ST segment, VT, and cardiogenic shock.

**Treatment** ►Get help. Take to ICU.

Principle is combined α- and β-adrenoreceptor blockade, but α must be started first, as unopposed β-blockade can worsen hypertension.

- Start with short-acting, IV α-blocker, eg phentolamine 2-5mg IV. Repeat to maintain safe BP.

- When BP controlled, give long-acting α-blocker, eg phenoxybenzamine 10mg/24h PO (increase by 10mg/d as needed, up to 30mg/12h PO); SE: postural hypotension; dizziness; tachycardia; nasal congestion; miosis; idiosyncratic marked BP drop after 1st dose. The idea is to ↑ the dose until BP is controlled and there is no significant postural hypotension. Alternative α₁-selective blockers, eg doxazosin, are preferred in some centres, particularly if surgery is not an option, eg metastatic tumour.

- A β₁-blocker may also be given at this stage to control any tachycardia or myocardial ischaemia/dysrhythmias (p114).

- Surgery is usually done electively after 4-6wks to allow full α-blockade and volume expansion. When admitted for surgery the phenoxybenzamine dose is increased until significant postural hypotension occurs.
