# Eliciting the weird and the wonderful

## Listen to your patient
You have two cultures to master: the host and the pathogen. Prolonged immersion in both may be needed.

## Ask
Do not expect to find apposite questions such as these in any other textbook:

1. *'Have you delivered any septic babies in the last year?'* Impress and cure your obstetrician friends who tell you that 'I'm so depressed about not being able to shake off this flu', and who have forgotten about transfer of brucellosis from baby to obstetrician.

2. *'Are your carp well at present?'* Mycobacterium marinum skin infection.

3. *'Could that be a Hyalomma tick bite from when you rode your ostrich in last week's race?'* Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

4. *'Who has been licking your face recently?'* Pasteurella multocida.

5. *'Has your dog been on holiday this year?'* Monkeypox from prairie dogs.

6. *'Has your pet hedgehog lost weight?'* Salmonella.

7. *'Did you develop your headache after you adopted your pet magpie?'* Zoonotic transmission of Cryptococcus neoformans causing meningitis.

8. *'Did you have a stray pig living under your house when the monsoon started?'* Pigs + standing water + mosquitoes = Japanese encephalitis.

9. *'Did you sample the local frog paella?'* Angiostrongyliasis causing eosinophilic meningitis.

10. *'Did your goat miscarry last year?'* Coxiella burnetii.

11. *'Did your depressed pig develop a purple snout?'* Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae endocarditis via swine erysipelas.

12. *'Can I see your pet lobster: he may be the cause of your bad hand?'* Lobsterman's hand, an erysipeloid infection from Erysipelothrix. Pet lobsters have a grand pedigree. GÃ©rard de Nerval used to take his pet lobster for walks, on a blue silk lead, beside the Seine (fig 9.60). A lobster, he said, is, 'serious-minded and quiet, doesn't scratch or bark like a dog, and knows all of the secrets of the deep'. His lobster's mission was to combat the Philistinism chaining us all to mediocrity.

Ask also, 'Where have you been?' Though you will not be absolved of thought, even when the answer is, 'Southend'. It may be a question of amnesic stopovers. Or perhaps your patient is an airport baggage-handler, bitten by a hitch-hiking mosquito. And even when there has been no travel to the tropics, global warming is ensuring that the tropics are travelling to us. To the first writers of medical books, Paradise was just beyond the Far East, and the world was a disc surrounded by oceans of blue water. But the world moves on, tarnished, tawdry, and trashed; and Paradise appears to be evolving with ever more serpents in the garden, beguiling us with ambiguous answers to our great questions.

## Don't give up
If the culture is negative, tests may need repeating. Perhaps the organism is 'fastidious' in its nutritional requirement or requires a longer incubation? Even if culture is achieved, it may be that the organism grown is flora not pathogen. If culture fails, look for antibodies or antigen. PCR is increasingly used for identification, but it is far from infallible; beware of inhibitors, contamination, and a primer that is not as unique as your patient.

Remember Sherlock: *'My mind,'* he said, *'rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, - or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.'*

The Sign of the Four, Arthur Conan Doyle, 1890.

No, Sherlock, you are not; you have the infectious disease physicians for company.
