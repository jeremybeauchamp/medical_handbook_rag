# Spondyloarthritides

The spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a group of related chronic inflammatory conditions. They tend to, although not always, affect the axial skeleton with shared clinical features:

1. Seronegativity (= rheumatoid factor -ve).
2. HLA B27 association—see BOX
3. 'Axial arthritis': pathology in spine (spondylo-) and sacroiliac joints.
4. Asymmetrical large-joint oligoarthritis (ie <5 joints) or monoarthritis.
5. Enthesitis: inflammation of the site of insertion of tendon or ligament into bone, eg plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, costochondritis.
6. Dactylitis: inflammation of an entire digit ('sausage digit'), due to soft tissue oedema, and tenosynovial and joint inflammation.
7. Extra-articular manifestations: eg iritis (anterior uveitis), psoriaform rashes (psoriatic arthritis), oral ulcers, aortic valve incompetence, inflammatory bowel disease.

NB: Behçet's syndrome (p694) can also present with uveitis, skin lesions, and arthritis and is not always associated with gross oral or genital ulcerations.

## 1. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
A chronic inflammatory disease of the spine and sacroiliac joints, of unknown aetiology (likely strong genetic/environmental interplay). Prevalence: 0.25-1%. Men present earlier: ♂:♀ ~6:1 at 16yrs old, and ~2:1 at 30yrs old. ~90% are HLA B27 +ve (see BOX). Symptoms and signs: The typical patient is a man <30yrs old with gradual onset of low back pain, worse during the night with spinal morning stiffness relieved by exercise. Pain radiates from sacroiliac joints to hips/buttocks, and usually improves towards the end of the day. There is progressive loss of spinal movement (all directions)—hence thoracic expansion. See pp540-2 for tests of spine flexion and sacroiliitis. The disease course is variable; a few progress to kyphosis, neck hyperextension (question-mark posture; fig 12.13), and spino-cranial ankylosis. Other features include enthesitis (see BOX), especially Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, at the tibial and ischial tuberosities, and at the iliac crests. Anterior mechanical chest pain due to costochondritis and fatigue may feature. Acute iritis occurs in ~⅓ of patients and may lead to blindness if untreated (but may also have occurred many years before, so enquire directly). AS is also associated with osteoporosis (up to 60%), aortic valve incompetence (<3%), and pulmonary apical fibrosis.

Tests: Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging.⁴ MRI allows detection of active inflammation (bone marrow oedema) as well as destructive changes such as erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis. X-rays can show SI joint space narrowing or widening, sclerosis, erosions, and ankylosis/fusion. Vertebral syndesmophytes are characteristic (often T11-L1 initially): bony proliferations due to enthesitis between ligaments and vertebrae. These fuse with the vertebral body above, causing ankylosis. In later stages, calcification of ligaments with ankylosis lead to a 'bamboo spine' appearance. Also: FBC (normocytic anaemia), ↑ESR, ↑CRP, HLA B27 +ve (+ve in 90-95% of cases but only 5% of patients HLA B27 +ve have AS).

Management: Exercise, not rest, for backache, including intense exercise regimens to maintain posture and mobility—ideally with a specialist physiotherapist. NSAIDs usually relieve symptoms within 48h, and may slow radiographic progression.³⁷ TNF α BLOCKERS (eg etanercept, adalimumab) are indicated in severe active AS.³⁸ Local steroid injections provide temporary relief. Surgery includes hip replacement to improve pain and mobility if the hips are involved, and rarely spinal osteotomy. There is risk of osteoporotic spinal fractures (consider bisphosphonates). Prognosis: There is not always a clear relationship between the activity of arthritis and severity of underlying inflammation (as for all the spondyloarthritides). Prognosis is worse if ESR >30; onset <16yrs; early hip involvement or poor response to NSAIDs.³⁹

## 2. Enteric arthropathy 
Associations: Inflammatory bowel disease, GI bypass, coeliac and Whipple's disease (p716). Arthropathy often improves with the treatment of bowel symptoms (beware NSAIDs). Use DMARDs for resistant cases.
