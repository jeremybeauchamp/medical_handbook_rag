## Calculating the heart rate

Divide 300 by the number of big squares per R-R interval (assumes the UK standard ECG speed of 25mm/s, elsewhere 50mm/s may be used: don't be confused!).

| R-R duration (s) | Big squares | Rate (per min) |
|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0.2              | 1           | 300            |
| 0.6              | 3           | 100            |
| 1.0              | 5           | 60             |
| 1.4              | 7           | 43             |

## Determining the ECG axis

Each 'lead' on the 12-lead ECG represents electrical activity along a particular plane (see fig 3.4).

The axis lies at 90° to the direction of the lead in which the isoelectric (equally +ve and -ve) QRS complex is found. For example, if the QRS is isoelectric in lead II (+60°), the axis is either:
- +60° - 90° = -30°, or
- +60° + 90° = +150°.

If the QRS is more positive than negative in lead I (0°) then the axis must be -30°, and vice versa.

In practice, the exact axis matters little; what you need to be able to recognize is whether the axis is normal (-30° to +90°), left-deviated (<-30°), or right deviated (>+90°). There are many ways of doing this. If the QRS in lead I (0°) is predominantly positive (the R wave is taller than the S wave is deep), the axis must be between -90° and +90°. If lead II (+60°) is mostly positive, the axis must be between -30° and +150°. So if both I and II are positive, the axis must be between -30° and +90°—the normal range. When II is negative, the axis is likely to be left-deviated (<-30°) and when I is negative, the axis is likely to be right-deviated (>+90°). One way of remembering this is:

- Lovers Leaving—Left axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and II point away from each other.
- Lovers Returning—Right axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and III ± II point towards each other (fig 3.11).
