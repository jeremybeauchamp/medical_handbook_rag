# Why are symptoms of thyroid disease so various, and so subtle? 221

Almost all our cell nuclei have receptors showing a high affinity for T₃: that known as TRα-1 is abundant in muscle and fat; TRα-2 is abundant in brain; and TRβ-1 is abundant in brain, liver, and kidney. These receptors, via their influence on various enzymes, affect the following processes:

- The metabolism of substrates, vitamins, and minerals.
- Modulation of all other hormones and their target-tissue responses.
- Stimulation of O₂ consumption and generation of metabolic heat.
- Regulation of protein synthesis, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
- Stimulation of demand for co-enzymes and related vitamins.

## Subclinical thyroid disease

### Subclinical hypothyroidism
Suspect if TSH >4mU/L with normal T₄ and T₃, and no symptoms. It is common: ~10% of those >55yrs have ↑TSH. Risk of progression to frank hypothyroidism is ~2%, and increases as ↑TSH; risk doubles if thyroid peroxidase antibodies are present, and is also increased in men. Management:

- Confirm that raised TSH is persistent (recheck in 2-4 months).
- Recheck the history: if any non-specific features (eg depression), discuss benefits of treating (p220) with the patient—maybe they will function better.
- Have a low threshold for carefully supervised treatment as your patient may not be so asymptomatic after all, and cardiac deaths may be prevented. Treat if: 1 TSH ≥10mu/L. 2 +ve thyroid autoantibodies. 3 Past (treated) Graves'. 4 Other organ-specific autoimmunity (type 1 DM, myasthenia, pernicious anaemia, vitiligo), as they are more likely to progress to clinical hypothyroidism. If TSH 4–10, and vague symptoms, treat for 6 months—only continue if symptoms improve (or the patient is trying to conceive). If the patient does not fall into any of these categories, monitor TSH yearly.
- Risks from well-monitored treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are small (but there is an ↑risk of atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis if over-treated).

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism
Occurs when ↓TSH, with normal T₄ and T₃. There is a 41% increase in relative mortality from all causes versus euthyroid control subjects—eg from AF and osteoporosis. Management:

- Confirm that suppressed TSH is persistent (recheck in 2-4 months).
- Check for a non-thyroidal cause: illness, pregnancy, pituitary or hypothalamic insufficiency (suspect if T₄ or T₃ are at the lower end of the reference range), use of TSH-suppressing medication, eg thyroxine, steroids.
- If TSH <0.1, treat on an individual basis, eg with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, AF, unexplained weight loss, osteoporosis, goitre.
- Options are carbimazole or propylthiouracil—or radioiodine therapy.
- If no symptoms, recheck 6-monthly.

Fig 5.16 Facial appearance in hypothyroidism. Look for: pallor; coarse, brittle, diminished hair (scalp, axillary, and pubic); dull or blank expression lacking sparkle; coarse features; puffy lids. These signs are subtle: ▶ have a low threshold for measuring TSH.
