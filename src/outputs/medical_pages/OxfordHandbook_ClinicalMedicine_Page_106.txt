Fig 3.1 Helen Taussig (1898-1986) battled dyslexia, deafness, and a male-dominated world to become a leading cardiologist. She noticed that 'blue babies' with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) tended to survive longer than those without. This was because many blue babies have congenital obstruction to pulmonary blood flow (eg pulmonary stenosis in tetralogy of Fallot, p157) and PDAs increase blood flow to the lungs, reducing cyanosis. She devised the Blalock-Taussig shunt which creates a passage from the subclavian or carotid artery to one of the pulmonary arteries, mimicking a PDA. This dramatically improved survival in babies with tetralogy of Fallot. One of the joys of cardiology is how often solutions already exist in nature and much of our intervention involves trying to mimic circumstances that can occur naturally. Hence, a good grasp of the underlying physiology is essential for understanding clinical cardiology; as well as interesting to pursue in its own right.
