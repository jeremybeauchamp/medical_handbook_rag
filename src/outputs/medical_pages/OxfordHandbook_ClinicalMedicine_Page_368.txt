# Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)

A malignancy of lymphoid cells, affecting B- or T-lymphocyte cell lineages, arresting maturation and promoting uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells, with marrow failure and tissue infiltration. Ionizing radiation (eg X-rays) during pregnancy, and Down's syndrome are important associations. It is the commonest cancer of childhood, and is rare in adults. CNS involvement is common.

## Classification Based on three systems:

1. **Morphological**: The FAB system (French, American, British) divides ALL into three types (L1, L2, L3) by microscopic appearance. Provides limited information (figs 8.45-8.48).

2. **Immunological**: Surface markers are used to classify ALL into:
   - Precursor B-cell ALL
   - T-cell ALL
   - B-cell ALL

3. **Cytogenetic**: Chromosomal analysis. Abnormalities are detected in up to 85%, which are often translocations.⁶ Useful for predicting prognosis, eg poor with Philadelphia chromosome (p358), and for detecting disease recurrence.

## Signs and symptoms (fig 8.49) Due to:

- Marrow failure: anaemia (↓Hb), infection (↓WCC), and bleeding (↓platelets).
- Infiltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy—superficial or mediastinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement—eg cranial nerve palsies, meningism.

**Common infections**: Especially chest, mouth, perianal, and skin. Bacterial septicaemia, zoster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (p400).

## Tests
- Characteristic blast cells on blood film and bone marrow. WCC usually high.
- CXR and CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
- Lumbar puncture should be performed to look for CNS involvement.

## Treatment
- Educate and motivate patient to promote engagement with therapy.
- **Support**: Blood/platelet transfusion, IV fluids, allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis syndrome). Insert a subcutaneous port system/Hickman line for IV access.
- **Infections**: These are dangerous, due to neutropenia caused by the disease and treatment: give immediate IV antibiotics. Start the neutropenic regimen (p352) and give prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics.
- **Chemotherapy**: Complex multi-drug, multi-phase regimens that may take years:
  - Remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + daunorubicin.
  - Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in 'blocks' over several weeks.
  - CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate ± CNS irradiation.
  - Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrexate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs. Relapse is common in blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up). More details: OHCS p194.
- **Matched related allogeneic marrow transplantations**: Once in 1st remission is the best option in standard-risk younger adults.

**Haematological remission**: Means no evidence of leukaemia in the blood, a normal or recovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow.

## Prognosis
Cure rates for children are 70-90%; for adults only 40% (higher when imatinib/rituximab, p358, are used). Poor prognosis if: adult, male, Philadelphia chromosome (p358: BCR-ABL gene fusion due to translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22), presentation with CNS signs, ↓Hb, WCC >100×10⁹/L, or B-cell ALL. PCR is used to detect minimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means. Prognosis in relapsed Ph-negative ALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant).

## Personalized treatment
One size does not fit all! Aim to tailor therapy to the exact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies, gene-targeted retinoids, cytokines, vaccines, and T-cell infusions are relevant here. Biomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase, can predict toxicity from thiopurines.
