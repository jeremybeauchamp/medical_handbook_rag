## Cancer treatment: medicine and surgery

### Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy is the use of any chemical substance to treat disease. In modern-day use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of cancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which is expressed differently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at intervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue. Chemotherapy is the only systemic treatment for cancer (surgery and radiotherapy are local treatments). This is important as most cancers are considered to be systemic either due to metastases, or the potential to metastasize in the future. Chemotherapy should be prescribed and given only under expert guidance by people trained in its use.

Includes:
- **Single-agent**: Rarely curative as genetically resistant cells are selected out.
- **Combination chemotherapy**: A combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action and different side-effect profiles reduces the likelihood of resistance and toxicity. The drugs used should have:
  - cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission
  - different mechanisms of action, ideally additive or synergistic effects
  - non-overlapping toxicity to maximize benefit of full therapeutic doses
  - different mechanisms of resistance.
- **Adjuvant**: After other initial treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, eg following surgical removal of, eg breast, bowel cancer.
- **Neoadjuvant**: Used to shrink tumours prior to surgical or radiological treatment. May allow later treatment to be more conservative.
- **Palliative**: No curative aim, offers symptom relief, may prolong survival.

### Classes of cytotoxic drugs
- **Alkylating agents**: Anti-proliferative drugs that bind via alkyl groups to DNA leading to apoptotic cell death, eg cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan.
- **Angiogenesis inhibitors**: Eg bevacizumab, aflibercept, sunitinib.
- **Antimetabolites**: Interfere with cell metabolism including DNA and protein synthesis, eg methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil.
- **Antioestrogens**: Aromatoase inhibitors (eg letrozole, anastrozole), oestrogen receptor antagonists (eg tamoxifen, raloxifene) used in breast cancer treatment.
- **Antitumour antibiotics**: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin, bleomycin.
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: Antibodies to a specific tumour antigen can slow tumour growth by enhancing host immunity, or be conjugated with chemotherapy/radioactive isotopes to allow targeted treatment. Expect more of these in future.
- **Topoisomerase inhibitors**: Interrupt regulation of DNA winding, eg etoposide.
- **Vinca alkaloids and taxanes**: 'Spindle poisons' which target mechanisms of cell division, eg vincristine, vinblastine, docetaxel.

### Side-effects
Due to cytotoxic effects on non-cancer cells. Greatest effect seen on dividing cells, ie gut, hair, bone marrow, gametes (see BOX 'Fertility and cancer', p525).
- **Vomiting**: Prophylaxis given with most cytotoxic regimens (see p251).
- **Alopecia**: May profoundly impact quality of life. Consider 'cold-cap', wig services.
- **Neutropenia**: Most commonly seen 7-14d after chemotherapy. Neutropenic sepsis is life-threatening and needs urgent assessment and empirical treatment (p352).

### Extravasation of chemotherapy

Extravasation = inadvertent infiltration of a drug into subcutaneous/subdermal tissue. 
**Presentation**: Tingling, burning, pain, redness, swelling, no 'flashback'/resistance from cannula. 
**Management**: Stop and disconnect infusion. Aspirate any residual drug before cannula removed. Follow local policies (ask for the 'extravasation kit'). Follow any drug-specific recommendations. For DNA-binding drugs (anthracyclines, alkylating agents, antitumour antibiotics), use a dry cold compress to vasoconstrict and ↓ drug spread. For non-DNA-binding drugs (vinca alkaloids, taxanes, platin salts), use a dry warm compress to vasodilate and ↑ drug distribution.
