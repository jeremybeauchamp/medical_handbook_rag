# Legal highs

Increasingly, 'designer' drugs, with chemical properties similar to illegal drugs (but yet sufficiently distinct to fall outside current legislation), are leading to acute poisoning and complications requiring admission. These drugs pose a difficult problem for the admitting physician, as the precise chemistry and mechanisms of action of both the active compound as well as any impurities are often unclear. Although many are legal, they can be as deadly as many well-known recreational drugs, leading to death or life-threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis. Be aware that these drugs are out there, and ask specifically about legal highs when taking a history, as there are often no screening tools for these drugs.
