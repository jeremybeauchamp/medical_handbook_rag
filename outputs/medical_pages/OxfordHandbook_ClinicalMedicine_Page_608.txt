594 Lumps

▶Examine the regional lymph nodes as well as the lump. If the lump is a node, examine its area of drainage. Always examine the circulation and nerve supply distal to any lump.

**History** How long has it been there? Does it hurt? Any other symptoms, eg itch? Any other lumps? Is it getting bigger? Ever been abroad? Otherwise well?

**Physical exam** Remember the 6 S's: site, size, shape, smoothness (consistency), surface (contour/edge/colour), and surroundings. Other questions: Does it transilluminate (see next paragraph)? Is it fixed/tethered to skin or underlying structures (see BOX)? Is it fluctuant/compressible? Temperature? Tender? Pulsatile (US duplex may help)?

**Transilluminable lumps** After eliminating as much external light as possible, place a bright, thin 'pen' torch on the lump, from behind (or at least to the side), so the light is shining through the lump towards your eye. If the lump glows red it is said to transilluminate—a fluid-filled lump such as a hydrocele is a good example.

**Lipomas** These benign fatty lumps, occurring wherever fat can expand (ie not scalp or palms), have smooth, imprecise margins, a hint of fluctuance, and are not fixed to skin or deeper structures. Symptoms are only caused via pressure. Malignant change very rare (suspect if rapid growth/hardening/vascularization). Multiple scattered lipomas, which may be painful, occur in Dercum's disease, typically in post-menopausal women.

**Sebaceous cysts** Refer to either epidermal (fig 13.11) or pilar cysts (they are not of sebaceous origin and contain keratin, not sebum). They appear as firm, round, mobile subcutaneous nodules of varying size. Look for the characteristic central punctum. Infection is quite common, and foul pus exits through the punctum. They are common on the scalp, face, neck, and trunk. Treatment: Excision of cyst and contents.

**Lymph nodes** Causes of enlargement: Infection: Glandular fever; brucellosis; TB; HIV; toxoplasmosis; actinomycosis; syphilis. Infiltration: Malignancy (carcinoma, lymphoma); sarcoidosis.

**Cutaneous abscesses** Staphylococci are the most common organisms. Haemolytic streptococci only common in hand infections. Proteus is a common cause of non-staphylococcal axillary abscesses. Below the waist, faecal organisms are common (aerobes and anaerobes). Treatment: Incise and drain. Boils (furuncles) are abscesses involving a hair follicle and associated glands. A carbuncle is an area of subcutaneous necrosis which discharges itself on to the surface through multiple sinuses. Think of hidradenitis suppurativa if recurrent inguinal or axillary abscesses.

**Rheumatoid nodules** (fig 13.12) Collagenous granulomas which appear in established rheumatoid arthritis on the extensor aspects of joints—especially the elbows (fig 13.12).

**Ganglia** Degenerative cysts from an adjacent joint or synovial sheath commonly seen on the dorsum of the wrist or hand and dorsum of the foot. May transilluminate. 50% disappear spontaneously. Aspiration may be effective, especially when combined with instillation of steroid and hyaluronidase. For the rest, treatment of choice is excision rather than the traditional blow from your bible (the Oxford Textbook of Surgery)! See fig 13.13.

**Fibromas** These may occur anywhere in the body, but most commonly under the skin. These whitish, benign tumours contain collagen, fibroblasts, and fibrocytes.

**Dermoid cysts** Contain dermal structures and are found at the junction of embryonic cutaneous boundaries, eg in the midline or lateral to the eye. See fig 13.14.

**Malignant tumours of connective tissue** Fibrosarcomas, liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas (smooth muscle), and rhabdomyosarcomas (striated muscle). These are staged using modified TNM system including tumour grade. Needle-core (Trucut®) biopsies of large tumours precede excision. Any lesion suspected of being a sarcoma should not be simply enucleated. ▶Refer to a specialist.

**Neurofibromas** See p514.

**Keloids** Caused by irregular hypertrophy of vascularized collagen forming raised edges at sites of previous scars that extend outside the scar (fig 13.15). Common in dark skin. Treatment can be difficult. Intralesional steroid injections are a mainstay.
