## 6 Abdomen

### Inspection:
- Scars—previous surgery, transplant, stoma
- Visible masses, hernias, or pulsation of AAA
- Visible veins suggesting portal hypertension
- Gynaecomastia, hair loss, acanthosis nigricans

### Palpation:
Squat by the bed so that the patient's abdomen is at your eye level. Ask if there is any pain and examine this part last. Watch the patient's face for signs of discomfort. Palpate the entire abdomen (see p565):

- Light palpation—if this elicits pain, check for rebound tenderness. Any involuntary tension in muscles ('guarding')? See p606.
- Deep palpation—to detect masses.
- Liver—using the radial border of the index finger aligned with the costal margin start palpation from the RIF. Press down and ask patient to take a deep breath. Continue upwards towards the costal margin until you feel the liver edge.
- Spleen—start palpation in RIF and work towards the left costal margin asking the patient to take a deep breath in and feeling for edge of the spleen.
- Kidneys—for each kidney: place one hand behind patient's loin, press down on the abdomen with your other hand and 'ballot' the kidney up with your lower hand against your upper hand (fig 2.30). Unless slim or pathology present, may not be palpable.
- Aorta—palpate midline above umbilicus, is it expansile? (fig 2.49, p79).

### Percussion:
- Liver—percuss to map upper & lower border of liver.
- Spleen—percuss from border of spleen as palpated, around to mid-axillary line.
- Bladder—if enlarged, suprapubic region will be dull.
- Ascites—shifting dullness: percuss centrally to laterally until dull, keep your finger at the dull spot and ask patient to lean onto opposite side. If the dullness was fluid, this will now have moved by gravity and the previously dull area will be resonant.

### Auscultation:
- Bowel sounds—listen just below the umbilicus.
- Bruits—listen over aorta and renal arteries (either side of midline above umbilicus).

## 7 To complete the examination
- Palpate for ankle oedema, examine the hernial orifices, external genitalia, and perform a rectal examination. Check the observation chart and dipstick urine.

### Top tips
- If you think there is a spleen tip, roll the patient onto their right side and feel again. This tips the spleen forward and allows you to percuss around to the back.
- Check the back for spider naevi, even if the chest appears clear (look for nephrectomy scars as you do this).
- Light palpation really should be light, to check for tenderness and very large masses, watching the patient's face throughout.
- If you suspect voluntary guarding, use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to assist with palpation and distract the patient who will think you are auscultating!
