Respiratory alkalosis ↑pH, ↓CO2 671
A result of hyperventilation of any cause. CNS causes: Stroke; subarachnoid bleed; meningitis. Others: Mild/moderate asthma; anxiety; altitude; T°; pregnancy; pulmonary emboli (reflex hyperventilation); drugs, eg salicylates.

Terminology To aid understanding, we have used the terms acidosis and alkalosis, where a purist would sometimes have used acidaemia and alkalaemia. Technically acidaemia is the state of having a low blood pH, whereas acidosis refers to the processes which generate H+, leading to the acidaemia.

The graph shows different areas representing:
- Metabolic acidosis
- Acute respiratory acidosis
- Chronic respiratory acidosis
- Respiratory alkalosis
- Metabolic alkalosis

A shaded area in the center represents normality.

Fig 14.2 The shaded area represents normality. This method is very powerful. The result represented by point x, for example, indicates that the acidosis is in part respiratory and in part metabolic. Seek a cause for each.
