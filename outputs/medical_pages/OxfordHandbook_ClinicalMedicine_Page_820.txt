# 806 Narrow complex tachycardia

ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms (<3 small squares on ECGs done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s).

## Differential diagnosis (See p126.)
- **Sinus tachycardia**: Normal P wave followed by normal QRS—not an arrhythmia! Do not attempt to cardiovert; if necessary (ie not a physiological response to fever/ hypovolaemia) rate control with β-blockers.
- **Atrial tachyarrhythmias**: Rhythm arises in atria, AV node is a bystander.
  - Atrial fibrillation (AF): absent P wave, irregular QRS complexes.
  - Atrial flutter: atrial rate ~260–340bpm. Sawtooth baseline, due to a re-entrant circuit usually in the right atrium. Ventricular rate often 150bpm (2:1 block).
  - Atrial tachycardia: abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS.
  - Multifocal atrial tachycardia: ≥3 P-wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes.
- **Junctional tachycardia**: AV node is part of the pathway. P wave either buried in QRS complex or occurring after QRS complex.
  - AV nodal re-entry tachycardia.
  - AV re-entry tachycardia, includes an accessory pathway, eg WPW (p133).

## Management
- Be guided by patient status, see fig 19.10.
- If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion.
- Otherwise, identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly. The most important thing is to decide whether the rhythm is regular or not (irregular is likely AF).
- Vagal manoeuvres (carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre) transiently increase AV block, and may unmask an underlying atrial rhythm.
- If unsuccessful, give adenosine, which causes transient AV block. It has a short half-life (10–15s) and works by: 1 transiently slowing ventricles to show the underlying atrial rhythm; 2 cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm.

**Adenosine**: Consult BNF if on dipyridamole or has had a heart transplant. Give 6mg IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline flush, while recording a rhythm strip. If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg, then one further 12mg bolus. Warn about SE: transient chest tightness, dyspnoea, headache, flushing. *Relative CI*: Asthma, 2nd/3rd-degree AV block or sinoatrial disease (unless pacemaker). *Interactions*: Potentiated by dipyridamole; antagonized by theophylline.

## Specifics
**Sinus tachycardia**: Identify and treat underlying cause.

**Supraventricular tachycardia**: If adenosine fails, use verapamil 2.5–5mg IV over 2min. NB: NOT if on a β-blocker. If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age <60yrs). Alternatives: atenolol 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given; or amiodarone. If unsuccessful, use DC cardioversion.

**Atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Manage with rate control; seek help if resistant (p130).

**Atrial tachycardia**: Rare; may be due to digoxin toxicity: withdraw digoxin, consider digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Maintain K+ at 4–5mmol/L.

**Multifocal atrial tachycardia**: Most commonly occurs in COPD. Correct hypoxia and hypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm.

**Junctional tachycardia**: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node occurs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junctional rhythm to sinus rhythm. If it fails or recurs, β-blockers (or verapamil—not with β-blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine). If this does not control symptoms, consider radiofrequency ablation.

- Seek specialist advice if resistant junction tachycardia, or accessory pathway.

## Wolff Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome
(ECG p133, fig 3.37.) Caused by congenital accessory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short PR interval and widened QRS complex due to slurred upstroke or 'delta wave'. Two types: WPW type A (+ve δ wave in V1), WPW type B (–ve δ wave in V1). Present with SVT which may be due to an AVRT (p126), pre-excited AF, or pre-excited atrial flutter. Risk of degeneration to VF and sudden death. Rx: Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone. Refer to cardiologist for electrophysiology and ablation of the accessory pathway.
