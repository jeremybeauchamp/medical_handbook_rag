The life cycle of malaria is dependent on both humans and mosquitoes (fig 9.27). Sporozoites are transferred to a human host when an infected mosquito bites. These travel via the bloodstream to the liver where maturation occurs to form schizonts containing ~30000 merozoite offspring. If a dormant stage exists (vivax, ovale, see table 9.19), and is inadequately treated, merozoites can be released from the liver weeks, months, or years later causing recurrent disease. The rupture of schizonts releases merozoites which enter RBCs ('what a fantastic niche!'). In the RBC, merozoites form larger trophozoites and erythrocytic schizonts (poor prognostic indicator if seen on blood film). The rupture of erythrocytic schizonts produces the clinical manifestations of malaria.

## Clinical features
- Consider in anyone with a fever who has previously visited a malarial area (fig 9.23), regardless of prophylaxis.
- Presentation: P. falciparum has a minimum incubation of 6 days and most commonly occurs within 3 months of return from an endemic area. Take a careful travel history: country, area of travel, date of return. Do not forget to ask about stopovers.
- Symptoms are non-specific: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, diarrhoea, cough. Fever patterns are described but only occur if rupture of infected RBCs is synchronized: alternate day for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale ('tertian'); every 3rd day for P. malariae ('quartan').
- Most patients have no specific fever pattern.
- Examination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable. If diagnosis is delayed or severe disease then may present with jaundice, confusion, seizures.

## Diagnosis
Immediate blood testing is mandatory in UK:
- Microscopy of thick and thin blood smear. Sensitive and specific in experienced hands.
- Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of parasite antigen. Used for initial screen if expert microscopy is unavailable, eg out-of-hours. Used in addition to (not instead of) blood film.

Results should be available within 4h. If malaria is suspected but blood film is negative: repeat at 12-24h and after further 24h. Malaria is unlikely if three expert serial blood films are negative. ∆∆ dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis/encephalitis, HIV, viral haemorrhagic fever. Care in pregnancy: thick films can be negative despite parasites in the placenta. Seek expert help.

If P. falciparum (or P. knowlesi) estimated % parasitized red cells should be given:
- >2% = ↑ chance of severe disease (indication for parenteral treatment see pp418-9).
- >10% = severe disease.

Other: FBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), creatinine and urine output (AKI), clotting (DIC), glucose (hypoglycaemia), ABG/lactate (acidosis), urinalysis (haemoglobinuria).

## Errors to avoid

| Errors to avoid |
|-----------------|
| • Failure to consider diagnosis | • Delay in blood film/RDT |
| • Inadequate travel history | • No serial blood film if first test negative |
| • Belief prophylaxis prevents all malaria | • Inadequate treatment (pp418-9) |
| • Belief presents with a fever pattern | • Inappropriate treatment (pp418-9) |
| • Non-specific symptoms not recognized | • Failure to anticipate/treat complications. |
