# Chest x-ray—part 3

Confirming the position of various tubes, lines, and leads on a CXR can be a daunting task, as incorrect positioning can have deadly consequences: an NG tube which is misplaced can cause aspiration pneumonia, or a poorly positioned CVC can lead to fatal arrhythmias. However, this can be a straightforward task if you recall some basic anatomy (figs 16.6, 16.7; table 16.2).

If you are unsure, always ask a senior.

## Table 16.2 Radiological confirmation of device placement

| Line/tube/lead | Correct position for tip(s) |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| CVC (p774) | In the SVC or brachiocephalic vein |
| PICC | In the SVC or brachiocephalic vein |
| Tunnelled line, eg Hickman | At the junction of the SVC and right atrium |
| Endotracheal | 3-7 cm above the carina (in adult) |
| Nasogastric (p759) | 10cm beyond the gastro-oesophageal junction |
| Chest drain (p766) | In the pleural space tracking either up (for pneumothorax) or down (for effusion) |
| Cardiac pacemaker/tempo-rary pacing wire (p776) | Atrial lead—in the right appendage Ventricular lead—in the apex of the right ventricle |

## Normal anatomy
- The SVC begins at the right 1st anterior intercostal space.
- The right atrium lies at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.
- The carina should be visible at the level of T5-T7 thoracic vertebrae.
- The right atrial appendage sits at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.

## Common bleeps from nursing staff

### 1 Central line not aspirating:
- Is the tip in the right place (see earlier in topic) or has it gone up into the internal jugular, too far in (sitting against the tricuspid valve, does the patient have an arrhythmia?) or not far enough in (sitting against a venous valve)?
- Is the tip kinked, suggesting it may be in a side vessel or against the vessel wall?
- If the line looks appropriately positioned, consider flushing gently, could the line be blocked?

### 2 Patient not ventilating well:
- Is the ET tube down the right main bronchus (causes left lung collapse, or rarely right pneumothorax)? Retract tube to correct position (see earlier in topic).
- Is the ET tube blocked? Most have a secondary port allowing ventilation even if the main hole is blocked, get anaesthetic assistance!

### 3 Chest drain not bubbling/swinging:
- Is it correctly positioned (see earlier in topic)—if not in the pleural space, it cannot drain the air/fluid. Common problems include sitting in the soft tissue of the chest wall, or sitting above the effusion, below the pneumothorax, or in the oblique fissure.
- Is it blocked? If draining an effusion and correctly positioned, consider gently flushing with 10mL of sterile saline, then aspirating. If not successful, obtain senior advice.
- Has the effusion/pneumothorax resolved? Pneumothoraces can rapidly resolve with a correctly positioned drain.

### 4 Unable to aspirate from NG tube:
- Is NG tube not far enough in/coiled in oesophagus? Tip is radio-opaque and should be visible below the diaphragm, if it is coiled it may lie in the pharynx or anywhere along the mediastinum.
- Is NG tube passing down the trachea and into the bronchus? The oesophagus is (generally speaking) a straight vertical line, if the tube veers off to left or right before it goes below the diaphragm, assume it is in the bronchus and replace it.
