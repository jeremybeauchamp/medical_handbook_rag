# 450 Cerebral blood supply

Knowledge of the anatomy of the blood supply of the brain helps diagnosis and management of cerebrovascular disease (pp470-8). Always try to identify the area of brain that correlates with a patient's symptoms and identify the affected artery.

**Internal carotid arteries** Supply the majority of blood to the anterior two-thirds of the cerebral hemispheres and the basal ganglia (via the lenticulostriate arteries). At worst, internal carotid artery occlusion causes fatal total infarction of these areas. More often, the picture is like middle cerebral artery occlusion (see later in topic).

**The circle of Willis** (fig 10.2) An anastomotic ring at the base of the brain fed by the three arteries that supply the brain with blood: the internal carotids (anteriorly) and the basilar artery (posteriorly, formed by the joining of the vertebral arteries, which supply the brainstem). This arrangement may compensate for the effects of occlusion of a feeder vessel by allowing supply from unaffected vessels; however, the anatomy of the circle of Willis is variable and in many people it does not provide much protection.

**Cerebral arteries** Three pairs of arteries leave the circle of Willis to supply the cerebral hemispheres: the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (figs 10.2, 10.3). The anterior and middle cerebrals are branches of the internal carotid arteries; in 80%, the basilar artery divides into the two posterior cerebral arteries. Ischaemia from occlusion of any one of them may be lessened by retrograde supply from leptomeningeal vessels.

**Anterior cerebral artery:** (fig 10.2) Supplies the frontal and medial part of the cerebrum. Occlusion may cause a weak, numb contralateral leg ± similar, if milder, arm symptoms. The face is spared. Bilateral infarction is a rare cause of paraplegia and an even rarer cause of akinetic mutism.

**Middle cerebral artery:** (fig 10.2) Supplies the lateral part of each hemisphere. Occlusion may cause contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss (esp. face and arm), contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to involvement of the optic radiation, cognitive change including dysphasia with dominant hemisphere lesions, and visuospatial disturbance (eg cannot dress; gets lost) with non-dominant lesions.

**Posterior cerebral artery:** (figs 10.2, 10.4) Supplies the occipital lobe. Occlusion gives contralateral homonymous hemianopia (often with macula sparing).

**Vertebrobasilar circulation** Supplies the cerebellum, brainstem, occipital lobes; occlusion causes signs relating to any or all three: hemianopia; cortical blindness; diplopia; vertigo; nystagmus; ataxia; dysarthria; dysphasia; hemi- or quadriplegia; unilateral or bilateral sensory symptoms; hiccups; coma. Infarctions of the brainstem can produce various syndromes, eg lateral medullary syndrome, in which occlusion of one vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery causes infarction of the lateral medulla and the inferior cerebellar surface (→ vertigo, vomiting, dysphagia, nystagmus, ipsilateral ataxia, soft palate paralysis, ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, and a crossed pattern sensory loss—analgesia to pin-prick on ipsilateral face and contralateral trunk and limbs). Locked-in syndrome is caused by damage to the ventral pons due to pontine artery occlusion. Patients are unable to move, but retain full cognition and awareness, communicating by blinking, electronic boards, or special computers. Right-to-die legislation may be invoked...as one sufferer blinked: 'My life is dull, miserable, demeaning, undignified, and intolerable.' Locked-in syndrome is different from other right-to-die conditions because patients need someone to do the act for them.

**Subclavian steal syndrome:** Subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery may cause blood to be stolen by retrograde flow down this vertebral artery down into the arm, causing brainstem ischaemia typically after use of the arm. Suspect if the BP in each arm differs by >20mmHg.
