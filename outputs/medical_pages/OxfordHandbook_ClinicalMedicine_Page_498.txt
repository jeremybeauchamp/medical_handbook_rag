# 484 Delirium (acute confusional state)

Delirium[^10] affects up to 50% of inpatients >65y, and is associated with a longer admission, more complications, and higher mortality. ▶Look for an underlying cause in any acute fluctuating, baffling behaviour change; it may be an early indication of treatable pathology (eg UTI).

## Clinical features
Globally impaired cognition, perception, and consciousness which develops over hours/days, characterized by a marked memory deficit, disordered or disorientated thinking, and reversal of the sleep-wake cycle. Some patients experience tactile or visual hallucinations. Delirium can be: •hyperactive, with restlessness, mood lability, agitation, or aggression •hypoactive in which the patient becomes slow and withdrawn or •mixed. ▶Hypoactive and mixed delirium are much harder to recognize: it is crucial to compare current behaviour to the patient's baseline (see BOX).

## Risk factors
>65y, dementia/previous cognitive impairment, hip fracture, acute illness, psychological agitation (eg pain).

## Causes
- Surgery/post-GA.
- Systemic infection: pneumonia, UTI, malaria, wounds, IV lines.
- Intracranial infection or head injury.
- Drugs/drug withdrawal: opiates, levodopa, sedatives, recreational.
- Alcohol withdrawal (2-5d post-admission; LFTs, MCV; history of alcohol abuse).
- Metabolic: uraemia, liver failure, Na+ or ↑glucose, ↓Hb, malnutrition (beriberi, p268).
- Hypoxia: respiratory or cardiac failure.
- Vascular: stroke, myocardial infarction.
- Nutritional: thiamine, nicotinic acid, or B12 deficiency.

## Differentials
Dementia (see BOX), anxiety, epilepsy: ▶non-convulsive status epilepticus is an underdiagnosed cause of impaired cognition and odd behaviour: consider an EEG. Primary mental illness (eg schizophrenia) can also mimic delirium, but this is rare on the wards (especially if no past history).

## Tests
Look for the cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U&E, LFT, blood glucose, ABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, blood cultures); also consider ECG, malaria films, LP, EEG, CT.

## Management
As well as identifying and treating the underlying cause, aim to:
- Reorientate the patient: explain where they are and who you are at each encounter. Hunt down hearing aids/glasses. Visible clocks/calendars may help.
- Encourage visits from friends and family.
- Monitor fluid balance and encourage oral intake. Be vigilant for constipation.
- Mobilize and encourage physical activity.
- Practise sleep hygeine: restrict daytime napping, minimize night-time disturbance.
- Avoid or remove catheters, IV cannulae, monitoring leads and other devices (they increase infection risk and may get pulled out).
- Watch out for infection and physical discomfort/distress.
- Review medication and discontinue any unnecessary agents. Only use sedation if the patient is a risk to their own/other patients' safety (never use physical restraints). Consider haloperidol 0.5-2mg, or chlorpromazine 50-100mg, PO if they will take it, IM if not (p15). Wait 20min to judge effect—further doses can be given if needed. NB: avoid chlorpromazine in the elderly and in alcohol withdrawal (p280); avoid antipsychotics in those with Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia.

▶Be aware that delirium may persist beyond the duration of the original illness by several weeks in the elderly. Do not assume this must be dementia—provide support and reassess 1-2 months later.
