# The acute abdomen

Someone who becomes acutely ill and in whom symptoms and signs are chiefly related to the abdomen has an acute abdomen. Prompt laparotomy is sometimes essential: repeated examination is the key to making the decision.

## Clinical syndromes that usually require laparotomy

1. **Rupture of an organ** (Spleen, aorta, ectopic pregnancy.) Shock is a leading sign—see table 13.10 for assessment of blood loss. Abdominal swelling may be seen. Any history of trauma: blunt trauma → spleen; penetrating trauma → liver? Delayed rupture of the spleen may occur weeks after trauma. Peritonism may be mild.

2. **Peritonitis** (Perforation of peptic ulcer/duodenal ulcer, diverticulum, appendix, bowel, or gallbladder.) Signs: prostration, shock, lying still, +ve cough test (p62), tenderness (± rebound/percussion pain, p62), board-like abdominal rigidity, guarding, and no bowel sounds. Erect CXR may show gas under the diaphragm (fig 13.26).
   NB: acute pancreatitis (p636) causes these signs, but does not require a laparotomy so don't be caught out and always check serum amylase.

## Syndromes that may not require a laparotomy

**Local peritonitis:** Eg diverticulitis, cholecystitis, salpingitis, and appendicitis (the latter will need surgery). If abscess formation is suspected (swelling, swinging fever, and ↑WCC) do US or CT. Drainage can be percutaneous (US or CT-guided), or by laparotomy. Peritoneal inflammation can cause localized ileus with a 'sentinel loop' of intraluminal gas visible on plain AXR (p729).

**Colic** is a regularly waxing and waning pain, caused by muscular spasm in a hollow viscus, eg gut, ureter, salpinx, uterus, bile duct, or gallbladder (in the latter, pain is often dull and constant). Colic, unlike peritonitis, causes restlessness and the patient may well be pacing around when you go to review!

**Obstruction of the bowel** See p610.

**Tests** U&E; FBC; amylase; LFT; CRP; lactate (is there mesenteric ischaemia?); urinalysis. Urine and serum hCG is vital to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Erect CXR (fig 13.26), AXR may show Rigler's sign (p728). Laparoscopy may avert open surgery. CT can be helpful provided it is readily available and causes no delay (pp732-3); US may identify perforation or free fluid (appropriate performer training is important).

**Pre-op** Don't rush to theatre. Anaesthesia compounds shock, so resuscitate properly first (p790) unless blood being lost faster than can be replaced, eg ruptured ectopic pregnancy, (OHCS p262), aneurysm leak (p654), trauma.

**Plan** Bed rest, keep NBM; assess volume status (BOX) and treat shock (p790); cross-match/group and save; analgesia (p574); arrange imaging; consider need for IVI, blood cultures, and antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV); ECG.

## The medical acute abdomen
Irritable bowel syndrome (p266) is the chief cause, so always ask about episodes of pain associated with loose stools, relieved by defecation, bloating, and urgency (but not blood—this may be UC). Other causes:

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Myocardial infarction | Pneumonia (p166) | Sickle-cell crisis (p341) |
| Gastroenteritis or UTI | Thyroid storm (p834) | Phaeochromocytoma (p837) |
| Diabetes mellitus/DKA (p206) | Zoster (p404) | Malaria (p416) |
| Bornholm disease | Tuberculosis (p393) | Typhoid fever (p415) |
| Pneumococcal peritonitis | Porphyria (p692) | Cholera (p430) |
| Henoch–Schönlein (p702) | Narcotic addiction | Yersinia enterocolitica (p431) |
| Tabes dorsalis (p412) | PAN (p556) | Lead colic |

**Hidden diagnoses** Mesenteric ischaemia (p620), acute pancreatitis (p636), and leaking AAA (p654) are the Unterseeboote of the acute abdomen—unsuspected, undetectable unless carefully looked for, and underestimatedly deadly. They may have non-specific symptoms and signs that are surprisingly mild, so always think of them when assessing the acute abdomen and hopefully you will 'spot' them!

Finally: always exclude pregnancy (± ectopic?) in females.
