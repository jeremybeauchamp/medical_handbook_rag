## Ulcerative colitis (UC)

UC is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa. It may affect just the rectum (proctitis, as in ~30%) or extend to involve part of the colon (left-sided colitis, in ~40%) or the entire colon (pancolitis, in ~30%). It 'never' spreads proximal to the ileocaecal valve (except for backwash ileitis). **Cause** Inappropriate immune response against (?abnormal) colonic flora in genetically susceptible individuals. **Pathology** Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic colonic mucosa ± pseudopolyps formed by inflammation. Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria—inflammation is normally not transmural. Continuous inflammation limited to the mucosa differentiates it from Crohn's disease. **Prevalence** 100–200/100 000. **Incidence** 10–20/100 000/yr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. UC is 3-fold as common in non-smokers (the opposite is true for Crohn's disease)—symptoms may relapse on stopping smoking.

**Symptoms** Episodic or chronic diarrhoea (± blood & mucus); crampy abdominal discomfort; bowel frequency relates to severity (see table 6.8); urgency/tenesmus≈proctitis. Systemic symptoms in attacks: fever, malaise, anorexia, ↓weight.

**Signs** May be none. In acute, severe UC there may be fever, tachycardia, and a tender, distended abdomen. *Extraintestinal signs:* Clubbing; aphthous oral ulcers; erythema nodosum (p265); pyoderma gangrenosum; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; iritis; large joint arthritis; sacroiliitis; ankylosing spondylitis; PSC (p282); nutritional deficits.

**Tests** *Blood:* FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, blood culture. *Stool MC&S/CDT:* (See p258.) To exclude Campylobacter, C. difficile, Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, amoebae. *Faecal calprotectin:* A simple, non-invasive test for GI inflammation with high sensitivity. *AXR:* No faecal shadows; mucosal thickening/islands (fig 16.9, p729); colonic dilatation (see 'Complications'). *Lower GI endoscopy:* Limited flexible sigmoidoscopy if acute to assess and biopsy; full colonoscopy once controlled to define disease extent (see p249, fig 6.10).

**Table 6.8 Assessing severity in UC (Truelove & Witts criteria modified to include CRP)**

| Variable | Mild UC | Moderate UC | Severe UC |
|----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Motions/day | ≤4 | 5 | ≥6 |
| Rectal bleeding | Small | Moderate | Large |
| T°C | Apyrexial | 37.1–37.8°C | >37.8°C |
| Resting pulse | <70 beats/min | 70-90 beats/min | >90 beats/min |
| Haemoglobin | >110g/L | 105-110g/L | <105g/L |
| ESR (do CRP too) | <30 | | >30 (or CRP >45mg/L) |

**Complications** *Acute:* Toxic dilatation of colon (mucosal islands, colonic diameter >6cm) with risk of perforation; venous thromboembolism: give prophylaxis to all inpatients regardless of rectal bleeding (p350); ↓K+ *Chronic:* Colonic cancer: risk related to disease extent and activity≈5–10% with pancolitis for 20yrs. Neoplasms may occur in flat, normal-looking mucosa. To spot precursor areas of dysplasia, surveillance colonoscopy eg 1–5yrs (depending on risk), with multiple random biopsies or biopsies guided by differential uptake by abnormal mucosa of dye sprayed endoscopically.

**Treatment** Goals are to induce, then maintain disease remission.^7^

*Mild UC:* • 5-ASA,^17^ eg mesalazine (=mesalamine) is the mainstay for remission-induction/maintenance. Given PR (suppositories or enemas) for distal disease (eg Pentasa® 1g daily); or PO for more extensive disease (eg Pentasa® 2g daily; once-daily dosing as effective as split dose; combine PR+PO if flare). • Topical steroid foams PR (eg hydrocortisone as Colifoam®), or prednisolone 20mg retention enemas (Predsol®) less effective than PR 5-ASA but may be added in addition.

*Moderate UC:* If 4–6 motions/day, but otherwise well, induce remission with oral prednisolone 40mg/d for 1wk, then taper by 5mg/week over following 7wks. Then maintain on 5-ASA (SEs: rash, haemolysis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, paradoxical worsening of colitis ▶monitor FBC and U&E at start, then at 3 months, then annually).

^17^ 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA or mesalazine) must be stabilized in oral preparations to survive gastric pH. Alternatively, olsalazine is a dimer of 5-ASA or balsalazide is a prodrug, both of which are cleaved in the colon. Rare hypersensitivity reactions: worsening colitis, pancreatitis, pericarditis, nephritis.
