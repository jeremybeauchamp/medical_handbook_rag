## Head injury

If the pupils are unequal, diagnose rising intracranial pressure (ICP), eg from extradural haemorrhage, and summon urgent neurosurgical help (p482). Retinal vein pulsation at fundoscopy helps exclude ICP.

### Initial management
See fig 19.21. Write full notes. Record times.

Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) remains the 1st priority. If GCS ≤8 then seek urgent anaesthetic and ICU help to protect airway.¹⁵

- Involve neurosurgeons early, especially if GCS, or if ICP suspected.
- Examine the CNS. Chart pulse, BP, T°, respirations + pupils every 15min.
- Assess anterograde amnesia (loss from the time of injury, ie post-traumatic) and retrograde amnesia (for events prior to injury)—extent of retrograde loss correlates with severity of injury, and never occurs without anterograde amnesia.
- Nurse semi-prone if no spinal injury; meticulous care to airway and bladder.

### Perform a CT head <1h if:
- GCS <13 on initial assessment, or GCS <15 at 2h following injury.
- Focal neurological deficit.
- Suspected open or depressed skull fracture, or signs of basal skull fracture: periobital ecchymoses ('panda' eyes/racoon sign), postauricular ecchymosis (Battle's sign), CSF leak through nose/ears, haemotympanum.
- Post-traumatic seizure.
- Vomiting more than once.

### Perform a CT head <8h if: 
Any loss of consciousness or amnesia AND any of: 
- age ≥65
- coagulopathy 
- high-impact injury, eg struck by or ejected from motor vehicle; fall >1m or >5 stairs 
- retrograde amnesia of >30min.

### Suspected cervical spine injuries: 
Perform a CT cervical spine <1h if:
- GCS <13 on initial assessment.
- The patient has been intubated.
- Definitive diagnosis of cervical spine injury is needed urgently (eg before surgery).
- The patient is having other body areas scanned, eg multi-region trauma.
- Clinical suspicion of cervical spine injury AND ANY OF: 
  - age 65 years or older 
  - high-impact injury 
  - focal neurological deficit 
  - paraesthesia in the upper or lower limbs.

If above-listed criteria are NOT met AND IF ANY OF the following low-risk features are present, then assess neck movement: 
- simple rear-end motor vehicle collision
- comfortable in a sitting position 
- ambulatory since injury 
- no midline cervical spine tenderness 
- delayed onset of neck pain. 

If patient unable actively to rotate neck 45° to left and right or if a low-risk feature not present, then obtain plain X-rays of cervical spine <1h. If X-rays technically inadequate, suspicious, or definitely abnormal, proceed to CT.

### Admit if: 
- new, clinically significant abnormalities on CT 
- GCS<15 after CT, regardless of result or continuing worrying signs (eg vomiting) 
- when CT indications met but CT unavailable 
- other concerns (eg drugs or alcohol, other injuries, CSF leak, shock, suspected non-accidental injury, meningism).

Do not attribute GCS to alcohol until a significant head injury has been excluded. Alcohol is an unlikely cause of coma if plasma alcohol <44mmol/L. If unavailable, estimate blood alcohol level from the osmolar gap (p668). If blood alcohol ≈ 40mmol/L, osmolar gap ≈ 40mmol/L.

### Discuss with neurosurgical unit 
All with significant abnormalities on CT or with eg persistent GCS ≤8 or deteriorating GCS (especially motor component), persistent confusion, progressive focal neurology, seizure without full recovery, penetrating injuries, or CSF leak. If transfer is required, ensure skilled medical escort and consider need for intubation prior to transfer.

### Complications 
- Early: Extradural/subdural haemorrhage, seizures. 
- Late: Subdural (p482), seizures, diabetes insipidus, parkinsonism, dementia.

### Indicators of a bad prognosis 
Old age, decerebrate rigidity, extensor spasms, prolonged coma, ↑BP, ↓PO₂ (on blood gases), T° >39°C. 60% of those with loss of consciousness of >1 month will survive 3–25yrs, but may need daily nursing care.
