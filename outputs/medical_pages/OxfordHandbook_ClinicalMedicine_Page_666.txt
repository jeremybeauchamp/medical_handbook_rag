## Torsion of the testis

The aim is to recognize this condition before the cardinal signs and symptoms are fully manifest, as prompt surgery saves testes. If surgery is performed in <6h the salvage rate is 90-100%; if >24h it is 0-10%.

If in any doubt, surgery is required. If suspected refer immediately to urology.

**Symptoms:** Sudden onset of pain in one testis, which makes walking uncomfortable. Pain in the abdomen, nausea, and vomiting are common.

**Signs:** Inflammation of one testis—it is very tender, hot, and swollen. The testis may lie high and transversely. Torsion may occur at any age but is most common at 11-30yrs. With intermittent torsion the pain may have passed on presentation, but if it was severe, and the lie is horizontal, prophylactic fixing may be wise.

**DD:** The main one is epididymo-orchitis (p650) but with this the patient tends to be older, there may be symptoms of urinary infection, and more gradual onset of pain. Also consider tumour, trauma, and an acute hydrocele. NB: torsion of testicular or epididymal appendage (the hydatid of Morgagni—a remnant of the Müllerian duct)—usually occurs between 7-12yrs, and causes less pain. Its tiny blue nodule may be discernible under the scrotum. It is thought to be due to the surge in gonado-trophins which signal the onset of puberty. Idiopathic scrotal oedema is a benign condition usually between ages 2 and 10yrs, and is differentiated from torsion by the absence of pain and tenderness.

**Tests:** Doppler US may demonstrate lack of blood flow to testis. Only perform if diagnosis equivocal—do not delay surgical exploration.

**Treatment:** Ask consent for possible orchidectomy + bilateral fixation (orchidopexy)—see p568. At surgery expose and untwist the testis. If its colour looks good, return it to the scrotum and fix both testes to the scrotum.

## Undescended testes

**Incidence** About 3% of boys are born with at least one undescended testis (30% of premature boys) but this drops to 1% after the first year of life. Unilateral is four times more common than bilateral. (If bilateral then should have genetic testing.)

- **Cryptorchidism:** Complete absence of the testis from the scrotum (anorchism is absence of both testes).
- **Retractile testis:** The genitalia are normally developed but there is an excessive cremasteric reflex. The testis is often found at the external inguinal ring. Rx: reassurance (examining while in a warm bath, for example, may help to distinguish from maldescended/ectopic testes).
- **Maldescended testis:** May be found anywhere along the normal path of descent from abdomen to groin.
- **Ectopic testis:** Most commonly found in the superior inguinal pouch (anterior to the external oblique aponeurosis) but may also be abdominal, perineal, penile, and in the femoral triangle.

**Complications of maldescended and ectopic testis** Infertility; ≈40× increased risk of testicular cancer (risk remains after surgery but in cryptorchidism may be ↓ if orchidopexy performed before aged 10), increased risk of testicular trauma, increased risk of testicular torsion. Also associated with hernias (due to patent processus vaginalis in >90%, p613) and other urinary tract anomalies.

**Treatment of maldescended and ectopic testis** restores (potential for) spermatogenesis; the increased risk of malignancy remains but becomes easier to diagnose.

**Surgery:** Orchidopexy, usually dartos pouch procedure, is performed in infancy: testis and cord are mobilized following a groin incision, any processus vaginalis or hernial sac is removed and the testis is brought through a hole made in the dartos muscle into the resultant subcutaneous pouch where the muscle prevents retraction.

**Hormonal:** Hormonal therapy, most commonly human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), is sometimes attempted if an undescended testis is in the inguinal canal.
