# 588 Diabetic patients undergoing surgery

Over 10% of surgical patients will have diabetes. This group face a greater risk of post-operative infection and cardiac complications. Tight glycaemic control is therefore essential and improves outcome. Aim to achieve an HbA1c of <69mmol/mol prior to elective surgery. Patients are often well informed about their diabetes—involve them fully in managing their diabetic care. Check your hospital's policy for managing diabetic patients who will be NBM before surgery. A general guide follows.

## Insulin-treated diabetes mellitus

- Try to place the patient first on the list in order to minimize the fasting period.
- Give all usual insulin the night before surgery.
- Long-acting (basal) insulin is usually continued at normal times (eg glargine; detemir), even when patients are on a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)—previously known as a 'sliding scale' (see BOX).
- If on AM list, ensure no subcutaneous rapid-acting (bolus) or mixed insulin is given on the morning of surgery. If PM list, give the normal morning bolus insulin, or half the mixed insulin dose.
- If eating and drinking post-operatively, resume the usual insulin with evening meal. If AM list (or early PM) and eating a late lunch, give half the morning insulin dose with this meal. If not eating until evening, a VRIII may be needed if the capillary glucose readings are high.
- Omit all rapid-acting and mixed insulin while the patient is on a VRIII.
- If not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hrs prior to surgery. Aim for serum glucose levels of 6-10mmol/L and check finger-prick glucose every 2 hrs. When ready to eat, give normal dose of rapid acting or mixed insulin with the 1st meal and stop the VRIII 30-60min later.
- IV fluid is required while the patient is on a VRIII: see BOX.
- A glucose-potassium-insulin (GKI) infusion can be used as an alternative to a VRIII, although it is no longer used as standard in the UK.

## Tablet-treated diabetes mellitus

- If diabetes is poorly controlled (eg fasting glucose >10mmol/L), treat as for patients on insulin (see earlier in topic).
- Give usual medications the night before surgery, except long-acting sulfonylureas (eg glibenclamide) which can cause prolonged hypoglycaemia when fasting and may need to be substituted 2-3 days pre-operatively. Discuss with the diabetes team.
- If eating and drinking post-operatively: on AM list, omit morning medication and take any missed drugs with lunch, after surgery. If PM list, take normal medications with breakfast, omit midday doses, and take any missed drugs with a late lunch. The dose of these may need reducing, depending on dietary intake.
- If not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hours prior to surgery. Once eating and drinking, oral hypoglycaemics can be restarted.
- Some patients may need a phase of subcutaneous insulin following major surgery—refer to the diabetes team if serum glucose levels are persistently raised.
- Metformin and iodine IV contrast: Metformin can be continued after IV contrast in patients with normal serum creatinine and/or eGFR >60mL/min. To minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity, if serum creatinine is raised or eGFR <60mL/min, stop metformin for 48h after contrast and check renal function has returned to baseline before restarting.

## Diet-controlled diabetes

There are usually no problems; patients should be treated as if not diabetic (and do not need to be first on the list). Check capillary blood glucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases blood glucose levels.

## Peri-operative morbidity and mortality

Diabetes mellitus is classed as an intermediate risk factor for increased peri-operative cardiovascular risk by the American Heart Association, so screen for the presence of asymptomatic cardiac and renal disease (p567) and be aware of possible 'silent' myocardial ischaemia. Long-term post-op survival has been found to be poorer for patients with diabetes; however, peri-operative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were only increased in the presence of congestive heart failure and haemodialysis—ie not diabetes alone.
