STREPTOMYCIN TREATMENT OF PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
A MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL INVESTIGATION

[Content of the journal article is not fully visible in the image]

Fig 4.1 In 1948, the Medical Research Council published a landmark paper in the BMJ about streptomycin as a treatment for pulmonary TB. The paper was regarded as a milestone in the history of clinical trials and set a precedent for the use of randomization in controlled trials. Before this, bed rest alone had been standard treatment for patients with pulmonary TB. After the successes of penicillin, there was excitement in the discovery that streptomycin proved effective against the tubercle bacilli. Patients aged 15 to 30 with 'acute progressive bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis of presumably recent origin, bacteriologically proved and unsuitable for collapse therapy' were entered into the trial. The streptomycin and bed rest group did better initially but the development of resistance was soon recognized. This was a new phenomenon which had not then been seen with penicillin. This led to the notion that combination therapies were needed to overcome TB drug resistance. The 'Edinburgh Method', described in 1957, advocated the use of triple therapy.
