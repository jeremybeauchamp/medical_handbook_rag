## Cardiac imaging

There are many heart conditions associated with structural defects, eg valve defects, congenital heart diseases, and some muscle disorders (eg hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)). Whilst clues to these can sometimes be found on history, examination, and ECG, it is imaging that gives the diagnosis. Imaging is also helpful for conditions that are not primarily due to deformities but which affect the way the heart functions. For example, after an MI the affected territory may be hypokinetic. Stress techniques allow us to observe the heart at rest and then under stress, comparing the perfusion and function in the two states. Cardiac MRI is a rapidly expanding area although not yet available in all major hospitals.

### Chest x-ray
The humble chest x-ray provides just a snapshot of the heart and little detail but can be an important source of information and is often the only immediately accessible imaging modality for a new or newly unwell patient. An enlarged heart (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5) suggests congestive heart failure; signs of pulmonary oedema suggest decompensated heart failure (see fig 3.38); a globular heart may indicate pericardial effusion (fig 3.14); metal wires and valves will show up, evidencing previous cardiothoracic surgery; dextrocardia may explain a bizarre ECG; and rib notching may be an important clue in coarctation of the aorta (p156).

### Echocardiography
This is the workhorse of cardiological imaging. Ultrasound is used to give real-time images of the moving heart. This can be transthoracic (TTE) or transoesophageal (TOE), at rest, during exercise, or after infusion of a pharmacological stressor (eg dobutamine). If the patient is too unwell to be moved, an echo machine can be brought to them and continuous TOE imaging may be used as a guide during surgery. Increasingly pocket-sized echo machines are used for a quick assessment of an unwell patient, to be followed by a formal scan later. See p110.

### Cardiac CT
This can provide detailed information about cardiac structure and function. CT angiography (fig 3.15) permits contrast-enhanced imaging of coronary arteries during a single breath hold with very low radiation doses. It can diagnose significant (>50%) stenosis in coronary artery disease with an accuracy of 89%. CT coronary angiography has a negative predictive value of >99%, which makes it an effective non-invasive alternative to routine transcatheter coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery disease. Medications are often given to slow the heart down and the imaging may be 'gated', meaning the scanner is programmed to take images at times corresponding to certain points on the patient's ECG. This allows characterization of the heart at different points in the cardiac cycle. See p740.

### Cardiac MR
A radiation-free method of characterizing cardiac structure and function including viability of myocardium. By varying the settings, different defects can be found. MR is the first-choice imaging method to look at diseases that directly affect the myocardium (fig 3.16). Nowadays, pacemakers are available which are safe for MR scanningâ€”check MR safety with your cardiac technicians before requesting MR for patients with pacemakers in situ. See p740.

### Nuclear imaging
Perfusion is assessed at rest and with exercise- or pharmacologically-induced stress. This test is particularly useful for assessing whether myocardium distal to a blockage is viable and so whether stenting or CABG will be of value. If hypoperfusion is 'fixed', ie present at rest and under stress, the hypoperfused area is probably scar tissue and so non-viable. If hypoperfusion is 'reversible' at rest, the myocardium may benefit from improved blood supply. See p741.
