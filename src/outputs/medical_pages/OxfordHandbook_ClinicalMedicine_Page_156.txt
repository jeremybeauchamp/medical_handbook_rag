## Rheumatic fever (RF)

This systemic infection is still common in developing countries but increasingly rare in the West. Peak incidence: 5-15yrs. Tends to recur unless prevented. Pharyngeal infection with Lancefield group A β-haemolytic streptococci triggers rheumatic fever 2-4wks later, in the susceptible 2% of the population. An antibody to the carbohydrate cell wall of the streptococcus cross-reacts with valve tissue (antigenic mimicry) and may cause permanent damage to the heart valves.

### Diagnosis
Use the revised Jones criteria (may be over-rigorous). There must be evidence of recent strep infection plus 2 major criteria, or 1 major + 2 minor.

#### Evidence of group A β-haemolytic streptococcal infection:
- Positive throat culture (usually negative by the time RF symptoms appear).
- Rapid streptococcal antigen test +ve.
- Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titre (eg anti-streptolysin O (ASO) or DNase B titre).
- Recent scarlet fever.

#### Major criteria:
- Carditis: tachycardia, murmurs (mitral or aortic regurgitation, Carey Coombs' murmur, p46), pericardial rub, CCF, cardiomegaly, conduction defects (45-70%). An apical systolic murmur may be the only sign.
- Arthritis: a migratory, 'flitting' polyarthritis; usually affects larger joints (75%).
- Subcutaneous nodules: small, mobile, painless nodules on extensor surfaces of joints and spine (2-20%).
- Erythema marginatum: (fig 3.42) geographical-type rash with red, raised edges and clear centre; occurs mainly on trunk, thighs and arms in 2-10% (p562).
- Sydenham's chorea (St Vitus' dance): occurs late in 10%. Unilateral or bilateral involuntary semi-purposeful movements. May be preceded by emotional lability and uncharacteristic behaviour.

#### Minor criteria:
- Fever.
- Raised ESR or CRP.
- Arthralgia (but not if arthritis is one of the major criteria).
- Prolonged PR interval (but not if carditis is major criterion).
- Previous rheumatic fever.

### Management
- Bed rest until CRP normal for 2wks (may be 3 months).
- Benzylpenicillin 0.6-1.2g IV stat, then phenoxymethylpenicillin 250-500mg 4 times daily PO for 10 days (if allergic to penicillin, give erythromycin or azithromycin for 10 days).
- Analgesia for carditis/arthritis: aspirin 100mg/kg/d PO in divided doses (max 4-8g/d) for 2d, then 70mg/kg/d for 6wks. Monitor salicylate level. Toxicity causes tinnitus, hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. Risk of Reye syndrome in children. Alternative: NSAIDs (p546). If moderate-to-severe carditis is present (cardiomegaly, CCF, or 3rd-degree heart block), add oral prednisolone to salicylate therapy. In case of heart failure, treat appropriately (p136); with severe valve disease, surgery may be required.
- Immobilize joints in severe arthritis.
- Haloperidol (0.5mg/8h PO) or diazepam for the chorea.

### Prognosis
60% with carditis develop chronic rheumatic heart disease. This correlates with the severity of the carditis. Acute attacks last an average of 3 months. Recurrence may be precipitated by further streptococcal infections, pregnancy, or use of the oral contraceptive pill. Cardiac sequelae affect mitral (70%), aortic (40%), tricuspid (10%), and pulmonary (2%) valves. Incompetent lesions develop during the attack, stenoses years later.

### Secondary prophylaxis
Penicillin V 250mg/12h PO. Alternatives: sulfadiazine 1g daily (0.5g if <30kg) or erythromycin 250mg twice daily (if penicillin allergic). Duration: If carditis+persistent valvular disease, continue at least until age of 40 (sometimes lifelong). If carditis but no valvular disease, continue for 10yrs. If there is no carditis, 5yrs of prophylaxis (until age of 21) is sufficient.
