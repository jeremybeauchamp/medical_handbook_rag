## Other viruses

### Respiratory tract viruses
Include rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Transmission by direct contact, infected fomites, airborne droplets. Presentation:
Coryza, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia. Diagnosis: Clinical. Viral
culture, antigen detection, PCR. Treatment: None in uncomplicated disease/immu-
nocompetent. Limited evidence for specific treatments in high-risk complicated
disease, immunosuppression: cidofovir for adenovirus; aerosolized ribavarin, im-
munoglobulin, monoclonal antibody in RSV. For influenza see pp396-7.

### Human papilloma virus (HPV)
>120 HPVs. Pathology:
- Skin warts, verrucas (HPV 1, 2). Treatment: none, topical salicylic acid, freezing.
- Anogenital warts (HPV 6, 11). Treatment: topical podophyllin, imiquimod; ablation.
- Cervical cancer (HPV 16, 18), other cancers (see p405).
Vaccination in UK: ♀ only, age 12-13, HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 since 2012.

### Polyomavirus
~100% exposure. Disease only with immunosuppression: BK virus causes renal trans-
plant nephropathy; JC virus causes progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy.

### Measles
Transmitted by respiratory droplets. Incubation
10-18d. Highly contagious: >95% population cov-
erage needed for 'herd' immunity. Presentation:
Prodrome (2-4d): fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, di-
arrhoea, Koplik spots (white spots on red buccal
mucosa, fig 9.15). Then generalized, maculopapu-
lar rash, classically face/neck→trunk→limbs (fig
9.16). Complications:
- Secondary infection: bacterial pneumonia, otitis
  media, ocular herpes simplex, oral/GI candidiasis.
- Acute demyelinating encephalitis: 1 in 1000, usu-
  ally within 2wk of rash. Seizures, fever, irritabil-
  ity, headache, ↓conscious level.
- Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis: 5-10yr af-
  ter infection, disturbances in intellect, personal-
  ity, seizures, motor dysfunction, decerebration.
  No treatment available.
Diagnosis: Clinical. IgM. Antigen in saliva/urine.
Treatment: Prevent with vaccination. Human
immunoglobulin within 3d of exposure in non-
immune. Supportive. No benefit shown for dexa-
methasone in encephalitis.

### Mumps
Respiratory droplet spread. Incubation 14-21d.
Common cause of encephalitis pre-vaccination.
Presentation: Can be subclinical. Prodrome: fever, myalgia, headache. Infection
and tender swelling of salivary glands: parotid > submandibular. Complications:
meningoencephalitis, epididymo-orchitis if pubertal/post-pubertal infection (warm,
swollen, tender testes 4d-6wk after parotitis→subfertility in ~10%, infertility rare),
oophoritis, pancreatitis, deafness. Diagnosis: Clinical. If confirmation needed eg
meningitis/encephalitis: mumps specific IgM/IgA, PCR. Treatment: Supportive.

### Rubella (German measles)
Respiratory droplet spread. Presentation: Usually mild/subclinical. Prodrome: fever,
conjunctivitis, rhinorrhoea. Rash: generalized, pink, maculopapular. Lymphadenopa-
thy: occipital, cervical, post-auricular. Congenital infection: Up to 90% risk of fetal
malformation in 1st trimester, sensorineural hearing loss/retinopathy in 2nd trimester.
Offer IgM/IgG testing. Immunoglobulin may ↓viraemia but will not prevent infection.
▶Vaccinate PRE-pregnancy, live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy.
