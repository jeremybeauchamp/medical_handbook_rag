# 766 Inserting a chest drain

## Indications
- Pneumothorax (p814): ventilated; tension; persistent/recurrent despite aspiration (eg <24h after 1st aspiration); large 2nd spontaneous pneumothorax if >50yrs old.
- Malignant pleural effusion, empyema, or complicated parapneumonic effusion.
- Pleural effusion compromising ventilation, eg in ICU patients.
- Traumatic haemopneumothorax.
- Post-operatively: eg thoracotomy; oesophagectomy; cardiothoracic surgery.

Pleural effusions are best drained under US guidance using a Seldinger technique. This technique is also used for pneumothoraces (except in traumatic or post-operative situations) without US guidance; for this reason it is detailed here.

## Sterile procedure
- Identify the point for drainage. In effusions, this should be done with US, ideally under direct guidance or with a marked spot. For pneumothoraces, check the drainage point from CXR/examination.
- Preparation: trolley with dressing pack; 2% chlorhexidine; needles; 10mL syringes; 1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage bottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient.
- Choose insertion site: 4-6th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary line—the 'safe triangle' (see BOX "The "safe triangle" for insertion" and fig 18.7). A more posterior approach, eg the 7th space posteriorly, may be required to drain a loculated effusion (under direct US visualization) and occasionally the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line may be used for apical pneumothoraces—however, both approaches tend to be less comfortable.
- Maintain sterile technique—clean and place sterile drapes. Scrub for insertion.
- Prepare your underwater drain by filling the bottle to the marked line with sterile water. Ensure this is kept sterile until you need it.
- Infiltrate down to pleura with 10mL of 1% lidocaine and a 21G needle. Check that air/fluid can be aspirated from the proposed insertion site; if not, do not proceed.
- Attach the Seldinger needle to the syringe containing 1-2mL of sterile saline. The needle is bevelled and will direct the guidewire; in general advance bevel up for pneumothoraces, bevel down for effusions.
- Insert the needle gently, aspirating constantly. When fluid/air is obtained in the syringe, stop, note insertion depth from the markings on the Seldinger needle. Remove syringe, thread the guidewire through the needle. Remove the needle and clamp the guidewire to the sterile drapes to ensure it does not move. Using the markings on the Seldinger needle, move the rubber stops on the dilators to the depth noted earlier, to prevent the dilator slipping in further than intended.
- Make a nick in the skin where the wire enters, and slide the dilators over the wire sequentially from smallest to largest to enlarge the hole, keep gauze on hand. Slide the Seldinger drain over the wire into the pleural cavity. Remove the wire and attach a 3-way tap to the drain, then connect to the underwater drainage bottle.
- Suture the drain in place using a drain stitch—make a stitch in the skin close to the drain site, tie this fairly loosely with a double knot. Then tie the suture to the drain. It is usually best to be shown this before attempting it for yourself. Dress the drain, and ensure it is well taped down.
- Check that the drain is swinging (effusion) or bubbling (pneumothorax) and ensure the water bottle remains below the level of the patient at all times. If the drain needs to be lifted above the patient, clamp it briefly. You should never clamp chest drains inserted for pneumothoraces. Clamping for pleural effusions can control the rate of drainage and prevent expansion pulmonary oedema.
- Request a CXR to check the position of the drain.

## Removal 
In pneumothorax: Consider when drain is no longer bubbling and CXR shows re-inflation. Give analgesia beforehand, eg morphine. Smartly withdraw during expiration or Valsalva. There is no need to clamp the drain beforehand as reinsertion is unlikely. In effusions: Generally the drain can be removed when drainage is <200mL/24h, but for cirrhotic hydrothoraces the chest drain is treated similarly to the ascitic drain (see p764) with HAS supplementation and removal at 4-6 hours.
