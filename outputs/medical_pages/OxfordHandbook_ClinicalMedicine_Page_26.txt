# Death

## The wisdom of death

Death is nature's cruel master stroke, allowing genotypes space to try new phenotypes. The time comes in the life of every organism when it is better to start from scratch, rather than carry on with the weight and muddle of endless accretions. Our bodies and minds are the perishable phenotypes on the wave of our genes. But our genes are not really our genes. It is we who belong to them for a few decades. And death is nature's great insult, that she should prefer to put all her eggs in the basket of a defenceless, incompetent neonate; rather than in the tried and tested custody of our own superb minds. But as our neurofibrils begin to tangle, and that neonate walks to a wisdom that eludes us, we are forced to give nature credit for her daring idea. Of course, nature, in her careless way, can get it wrong: people often die in the wrong order and one of our chief roles is to prevent this misordering of deaths, not the phenomenon of death itself. With that exception, we must admit that dying is a brilliant idea, and one that it is most unlikely we would ever have devised ourselves.

## Diagnosing dying

Would you be surprised if your patient were to die in the next few days, weeks, or months? If the answer is 'no' then end-of-life choices, decisions, and care should be addressed.

Consider: decline in functional performance, eg in bed or chair >50% of day, increasing dependence, weight of co-morbidity, unstable or deteriorating symptom burden, decreased treatment response, weight loss >10% in 6 months, crisis admissions, serum albumin <25g/L, sentinel event, eg fall, transfer to nursing home.

## Diagnosing death

Death¹³ is the irreversible loss of the essential characteristics which are necessary for the existence of a human being.

### Death following cessation of cardiorespiratory function:
- Simultaneous and irreversible onset of apnoea, absence of circulation, and unconsciousness.

Cardiorespiratory arrest is confirmed by observation of the following:
- Absence of central pulse on palpation.
- Absence of heart sounds on auscultation.
- After 5 minutes of cardiorespiratory arrest absence of brainstem activity is confirmed by the absence of pupillary responses to light, an absent corneal reflex, and no motor response to supra-orbital pressure.

The time of death is the time at which these criteria are fulfilled.

### Brainstem death:
- Brainstem pathology causing irreversible damage to its integrative functions including neural control of cardiorespiratory function and consciousness.

Diagnosed by an absence of brainstem reflexes:
- No pupil light response.
- No corneal reflex (blink to touch).
- Absent oculovestibular reflexes (no eye movements seen with injection of ice-cold water into each external auditory meatus, tympanic membranes visualized).
- No motor response to stimulation within the cranial nerve distribution (supra-orbital pressure).
- No cough/gag reflex.
- No respiratory response to hypercarbia: oxgenation is maintained (SpO₂>85%) but ventilation is reduced to achieve PCO₂ ≥6.0kPa with pH ≤7.40. No respiratory response is seen within 5 minutes and PCO₂ rises by >0.5kPa.

Diagnosis is made by two competent doctors registered for >5 years testing together completely and successfully on two separate occasions.
