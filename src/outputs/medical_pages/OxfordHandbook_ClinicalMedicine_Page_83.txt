## 4 Power

Direct patient to adopt position and follow the following commands while you as the examiner resist movements as appropriate to grade power (p446). Test each muscle group bilaterally before moving on to the next position. See pp452-3 for myotomes.

- **Hip flexion**: 'Keeping your leg straight, can you lift your leg off the bed, don't let me push it down.'
- **Hip extension**: 'And now using your leg, push my hand into the bed.'
- **Hip abduction**: Position hands on outer thighs—'push your legs out to the sides.'
- **Hip adduction**: Position hands on inner thighs—'and push your legs together.'
- **Knee flexion and extension**: 'Bend your knee and bring your heel to your bottom, don't let me pull it away... and now kick out against me and push me away.'
- **Ankle plantar flexion**: With your hand on the underside of the patient's foot ask them to 'bend your foot down, pushing my hand away.'
- **Ankle dorsiflexion**: Put your hand on the dorsum of the foot and ask them to 'lift up your foot, point your toes at the ceiling, don't let me push your foot down.'

## 5 Coordination

**Heel-shin test**: Using your finger on the patient's shin to demonstrate, instruct patient to 'put your heel just below your knee then run it smoothly down your shin, lift it up and place it back on your knee, now run it down again', etc. Repeat on the other side. Also, fast alternate foot tapping onto examiners's hands with patient lying down.

## 6 Sensation

As upper limbs (p67):
- Light touch: Lower limb dermatomes (p454).
- Pin prick
- Temperature
- Vibration
- Joint position sense: With the patient's eyes closed grasp distal phalanx of the great toe at the sides. Stabilize the rest of the toe. Move the joint up and tell patient 'this is up', and down, saying 'this is down'. Flex and extend the joint, stopping at intervals to ask whether the toe is up or down.

### Top tips

- If you are limited for time, gait is the most useful test to start with.
- Make sure you test each muscle group individually by stabilizing above the joint you are testing.
- Test vibration by putting a buzzing tuning fork on the bony part of a joint (most distal point) with the patient's eyes closed then ask them to tell you when the buzzing stops (pinch the tuning fork to stop it) to distinguish vibration from pressure sensation.
