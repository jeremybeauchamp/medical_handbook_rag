# 650 Lumps in the groin and scrotum

- Testicular lump = cancer until proved otherwise.
- Acute, tender enlargement of testis = torsion (p652) until proved otherwise.

## Diagnosing scrotal masses (fig 13.51)
1. Can you get above it? 2. Is it separate from the testis? 3. Cystic or solid?
- Cannot get above: inguinoscrotal hernia (p614) or hydrocele extending proximally.
- Separate and cystic: epididymal cyst.
- Separate and solid: epididymitis/varicocele.
- Testicular and cystic: hydrocele.
- Testicular and solid—tumour, haematocele, granuloma (p196), orchitis, gumma (p412). US may help.

### Epididymal cysts
Usually develop in adulthood and contain clear or milky (spermatocele) fluid. They lie above and behind the testis. Remove if symptomatic.

### Hydroceles
(Fluid within the tunica vaginalis.) Primary (associated with a patent processus vaginalis, which typically resolves during the 1st year of life) or secondary to testis tumour/trauma/infection. Primary hydroceles are more common, larger, and usually in younger men. Can resolve spontaneously. ℞: Aspiration (may need repeating) or surgery: plicating the tunica vaginalis (Lord's repair)/inverting the sac (Jaboulay's repair). Is the testis normal after aspiration? If any doubt, do US.

### Epididymo-orchitis
Causes: Chlamydia (eg if <35yrs); E. coli; mumps; N. gonorrhoeae; TB. Features: Sudden-onset tender swelling, dysuria, sweats/fever. Take '1st catch' urine sample; look for urethral discharge. Consider STI screen. Warn of possible infertility and symptoms worsening before improving. ℞: If <35yrs; doxycycline 100mg/12h (covers chlamydia; treat sexual partners). If gonorrhoea suspected add ceftriaxone 500mg IM stat. If >35yrs (mostly non-STI), associated UTI is common so try ciprofloxacin 500mg/12h or ofloxacin 200mg/12h. Antibiotics should be used for 2-4wks. Also: analgesia, scrotal support, drainage of any abscess.

### Varicocele
Dilated veins of pampiniform plexus. Left side more commonly affected. Often visible as distended scrotal blood vessels that feel like 'a bag of worms'. Patient may complain of dull ache. Associated with subfertility, but repair (via surgery or embolization) seems to have little effect on subsequent pregnancy rates.

### Haematocele
Blood in tunica vaginalis, follows trauma, may need drainage/excision.

### Testicular tumours
The commonest malignancy in ♂ aged 15-44; 10% occur in undescended testes, even after orchidopexy. A contralateral tumour is found in 5%. Types: Seminoma, 55% (30-65yrs); non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, 33% (NSGCT; previously teratoma; 20-30yrs); mixed germ cell tumour, 12%; lymphoma.

Signs: Typically painless testis lump, found after trauma/infection ± haemospermia, secondary hydrocele, pain, dyspnoea (lung mets), abdominal mass (enlarged nodes), or effects of secreted hormones. 25% of seminomas & 50% of NSGCTs present with metastases. Risk factors: Undescended testis; infant hernia; infertility.

Staging: 1 No evidence of metastasis. 2 Infradiaphragmatic node involvement (spread via the para-aortic nodes not inguinal nodes). 3 Supradiaphragmatic node involvement. 4 Lung involvement (haematogenous).

Tests: (Allow staging.) CXR, CT, excision biopsy. α-FP (eg >3IU/mL)¹³ and β-hCG are useful tumour markers and help monitor treatment (p531); check before & during ℞.

℞: Radical orchidectomy (inguinal incision; occlude the spermatic cord before mobilization to ↓risk of intra-operative spread). Options are constantly updated (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). Seminomas are exquisitely radiosensitive. Stage 1 seminomas: orchidectomy + radiotherapy cures ~95%. Do close follow-up to detect relapse. Cure of NSGCT, even if metastases are present, is achieved by 3 cycles of bleomycin + etoposide + cisplatin. 5yr survival >90% in all groups.

- Encourage regular self-examination (prevents late presentation).
