Table 6.13 Primary liver tumours

| Malignant (prognosis—regardless of type—is poor) | Benign |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------|
| HCC | Cysts |
| Cholangiocarcinoma | Haemangioma;* common, ♂:♀≈5:1 |
| Angiosarcoma | Adenoma |
| Hepatoblastoma | Focal nodular hyperplasia |
| Fibrosarcoma & hepatic gastrointestinal stro- mal tumour (GIST†, formerly leiomyosarcoma) | Fibroma |
| | Benign GIST (=leiomyoma) |

\* Haemangiomas are hyperechoic on ultrasound; may be part of von Hippel–Lindau syndrome; may need surgery if diagnosis is uncertain (may be confused with HCC) or they are enlarging on 6-monthly US.

† GISTs are mesenchymal tumours that are more likely to be found in the gut as a spherical mass arising from the muscularis propria, eg with GI bleeding. If unresectable, imatinib ↑2yr survival from 26% to 76%.

Table 6.14 Origins of secondary liver tumours

| Common in men | Common in women | Less common (either sex) |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Stomach | Breast | Pancreas |
| Lung | Colon | Leukaemia |
| Colon | Stomach | Lymphoma |
| | Uterus | Carcinoid tumours |

### Vaccinating to prevent hepatitis B (and associated complications)

Use hepatitis B vaccine 1mL into deltoid; repeat at 1 & 6 months (child: 0.5mL × 3 into the anterolateral thigh). Indications: Everyone (WHO advice, even in areas of 'low' endemicity—in 2014 this meant that 82% of the world's children received protection against HBV). This contrasts with the approach in eg the UK and USA of targeting at-risk groups (p278). The immunocompromised and others may need further doses. Serology helps time boosters and finds non-responders (correlates with older age, smoking, and ♂ sex). Know your own antibody level!

Table 6.15 Post-immunization anti-HBs titres and actions

| Anti-HBs (IU/L) | Actions and comments (advice differs in some areas) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| >1000 | Good level of immunity; retest in ~4yrs. |
| 100–1000 | Good level of immunity; if level approaches 100, retest in 1yr. |
| <100 | Inadequate; give booster and retest. |
| <10 | Non-responder; give another set of 3 vaccinations. Retest; if <10 get consent to check hepatitis B status: HBsAg +ve means chronic infection; anti-HB core +ve represents past infection and immunity. If a non-responder is deemed susceptible to HBV, and has recently come in contact with risky bodily fluids, offer 2 doses of anti-hep B immunoglobulin. |

NB: protection begins some weeks after dose 1, so it won't work if exposure is recent; here, specific antihepatitis B immunoglobulin is best if not already immunized.
