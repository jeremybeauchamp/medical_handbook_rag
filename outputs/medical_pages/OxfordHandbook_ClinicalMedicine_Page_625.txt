## Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?

**Paralytic ileus** is adynamic bowel due to the absence of normal peristaltic contractions. Contributing factors include abdominal surgery, pancreatitis (or any localized peritonitis), spinal injury, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, uraemia, peritoneal sepsis and drugs (eg tricyclic antidepressants).

**Pseudo-obstruction** resembles mechanical GI obstruction but with no obstructing lesion. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is called Ogilvie's syndrome (p706), and clinical features are similar to that of mechanical obstruction. Predisposing factors: puerperium; pelvic surgery; trauma; cardiorespiratory and neurological disorders. Treatment: Neostigmine or colonoscopic decompression are sometimes useful. In chronic pseudo-obstruction weight loss from malabsorption is a problem.

## Sigmoid volvulus

Sigmoid volvulus occurs when the bowel twists on its mesentery, which can produce severe, rapid, strangulated obstruction (fig 13.28c). It tends to occur in the elderly, constipated, and comorbid patient, and is managed by insertion of a flatus tube or sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoid colectomy is sometimes required. If not treated successfully, it can progress to perforation and fatal peritonitis.

### Fig 13.28 
(a) Small bowel obstruction: AXR shows central gas shadows with valvulae conniventes that completely cross the lumen and no gas in the large bowel. 
(b) Large bowel obstruction: AXR shows peripheral gas shadows proximal to the blockage (eg in caecum) but not in the rectum. 
(c) Sigmoid volvulus: there is a characteristic AXR with an 'inverted U' loop of bowel that looks a bit like a coffee bean.
