The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with the following content:

| Lead | ECG Tracing |
|------|-------------|
| I    | Normal sinus rhythm with slight ST depression |
| aVR  | Inverted P waves, QRS, and T waves |
| V1   | RSR' pattern ("M" shape) characteristic of right bundle branch block |
| V4   | Tall R waves with deep S waves |
| II   | Normal sinus rhythm with slight ST depression |
| aVL  | Small R waves with deep S waves |
| V2   | RSR' pattern with deep S wave |
| V5   | Tall R waves with slurred S waves |
| III  | Small Q waves, upright T waves |
| aVF  | Upright P, QRS, and T waves |
| V3   | Transition zone between V2 and V4 patterns |
| V6   | Tall R waves with slurred S waves (similar to V5) |
| II (rhythm strip) | Continuous recording showing consistent rhythm |
