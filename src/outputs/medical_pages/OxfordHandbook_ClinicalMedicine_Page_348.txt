# B12 deficiency and pernicious anaemia

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common, occurring in up to 15% of older people. B12 helps synthesize thymidine, and hence DNA, so in deficiency RBC production is slow. Untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (p332) and irreversible CNS complications. ▶ Body stores of B12 are sufficient for 4yrs.

## Causes of deficiency
- Dietary (eg vegans: B12 is found in meat, fish, and dairy products, but not in plants).
- Malabsorption: during digestion, intrinsic factor (IF) in the stomach binds B12, enabling it to be absorbed in the terminal ileum. Malabsorption can therefore arise in the stomach due to lack of IF (pernicious anaemia, post gastrectomy) or the terminal ileum (ileal resection, Crohn's disease, bacterial overgrowth, tropical sprue, tapeworms).
- Congenital metabolic errors.

## Features
### General:
Symptoms of anaemia (p324), 'lemon tinge' to skin due to combination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis (beefy-red sore tongue; fig 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326).

### Neuropsychiatric:
Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia.

### Neurological:
Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy. Also subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a combination of peripheral sensory neuropathy with both upper and lower motor neuron signs due to B12. The patient may display the classical triad of:
- extensor plantars (UMN)
- absent knee jerks (LMN)
- absent ankle jerks (LMN)

The onset is insidious (subacute) and signs are symmetrical. There is a combination of posterior (dorsal) column loss, causing the sensory and LMN signs, and corticospinal tract loss, causing the motor and UMN signs (p446). The spinothalamic tracts are preserved so pain and temperature sensation may remain intact even in severe cases. Joint-position and vibration sense are often affected first leading to ataxia, followed by stiffness and weakness if untreated.

▶ The neurological signs of B12 deficiency can occur without anaemia.

## Pernicious anaemia (PA)
This is an autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis leads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 therefore remains unbound and consequently cannot be absorbed by the terminal ileum.

**Incidence:** 1:1000; ♀:♂≈1.6:1; usually >40yrs; higher incidence if blood group A.

**Associations:** Other autoimmune diseases (p553): thyroid disease (~25%), vitiligo, Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism. Carcinoma of stomach is ~3-fold more common in pernicious anaemia, so have a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy.

**Tests:**
- Hb.
- MCV.
- WCC and ↓platelets if severe.
- ↓Serum B12⁴.
- Reticulocytes may be ↓ as production impaired.
- Hypersegmented neutrophils (p332).
- Megaloblasts in the marrow.
- Specific tests for PA: 1 Parietal cell antibodies: found in 90% with PA, but also in 3-10% without. 2 IF antibodies: specific for PA but lower sensitivity.

**Treatment:** Treat the cause if possible. If due to malabsorption, give hydroxocobalamin (B12) 1mg IM alternate days for 2wks (or, if CNS signs, until improvement stops), then 1mg IM every 3 months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12 can be given after the initial IM course (50-150mcg/daily, between meals). Improvement is indicated by a transient marked reticulocytosis (↓MCV), after 4-5 days.

**Practical hints:**
- Beware of diagnosing PA in those under 40yrs old: look for GI malabsorption (small bowel biopsy, p266).
- Watch for hypokalaemia due to uptake into new haematopoietic cells.
- Transfusion is best avoided, but PA with high-output CCF may require transfusion, after doing tests for FBC, folate, B12, and marrow sampling.
- As haematopoiesis accelerates on treatment, additional iron may be needed.
- Hb rises ~10g/L per week; WCC and platelet count should normalize in 1wk.

**Prognosis:** Supplementation usually improves peripheral neuropathy within the first 3-6 months, but has little effect on cord signs. Patients do best if treated as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms: don't delay!

⁴ Serum B12 levels are normal in many patients with subclinical B12 deficiency. Measuring homocysteine or methylmalonic acid (↑ if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests.
