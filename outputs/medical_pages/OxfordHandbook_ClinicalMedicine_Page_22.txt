# Prescribing drugs

- Consult the BNF or BNF for Children or similar before giving any drug with which you are not thoroughly familiar.
- Check the patient's allergy status and make all reasonable attempts to qualify the reaction (table 1.2). The burden of iatrogenic hospital admission and avoidable drug-related deaths is real. Equally, do not deny life-saving treatment based on a mild and predictable reaction.
- Check drug interactions meticulously.

## Table 1.2 Drug reactions

| Type of reaction | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| True allergy | Anaphylaxis: oedema, urticaria, wheeze (p794-5) |
| Side-effect | All medications have side-effects. The most common are rash, itch, nausea, diarrhoea, lethargy, and headache |
| Increased effect/ toxicity | Due to inter-individual variance. Dosage regimen normally corrects for this but beware states of altered drug clearance such as liver and renal (p305) impairment |
| Drug interaction | Reaction due to drugs used in combination, eg azathioprine and allopurinol, erythromycin and warfarin |

Remember *primum non nocere*: first do no harm. The more minor the illness, the more weight this carries. Overall, doctors have a tendency to prescribe too much rather than too little.

Consider the following when prescribing any medication:

1. The *underlying pathology*. Do not let the amelioration of symptoms lead to failure of investigation and diagnosis.
2. Is this prescription according to *best evidence*?
3. *Drug reactions*. All medications come with risks, potential side-effects, inconvenience to the patient, and expense.
4. Is the patient taking *other medications*?
5. *Alternatives to medication*. Does the patient really need or want medication? Are you giving medication out of a sense of needing to do something, or because you genuinely feel it will help the patient? Is it more appropriate to offer information, reassurance, or lifestyle modification?
6. Is there a risk of *overdose or addiction*?
7. Can you *assist the patient*? Once per day is better than four times. How easy is it to open the bottle? Is there an intervention that can help with medicine management, eg a multi-compartment compliance aid, patient counselling, an IT solution such as a smartphone app?
8. *Future planning*. How are you going to decide whether the medication has worked? What are the indications to continue, stop, or change the prescribed regimen?

## In appreciation of pain

Pain is often seen as an unequivocally bad thing, and certainly many patients dream of a life without pain. However, without pain we are vulnerable to ourselves and our behaviours, and risk ignorance of underlying conditions.

While most children quickly learn not to touch boiling water as their own body disciplines their behaviour with the punishment of pain; children born with congenital insensitivity to pain (CIPA) can burn themselves, break bones, and tear skin without feeling any immediate ill effect. Their health is constantly at risk from unconsciously self-mutilating behaviours and unnoticed trauma. CIPA is very rare but examples of the human tendency for self-damage without the protective factor of pain are common. Have you ever bitten your tongue or cheek after a dental anaesthetic? Patients with diabetic neuropathy risk osteomyelitis and arthropathy in their pain-free feet.

If you receive a message of bad news, you do not solve the problem by hiding the message. Listen to the pain as well as making the patient comfortable.
