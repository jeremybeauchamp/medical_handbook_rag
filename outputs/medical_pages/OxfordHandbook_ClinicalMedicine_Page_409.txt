# Latent TB

Balance the risk of development of active disease with the possible side-effects of treatment. Consider treatment in all at risk of active disease: HIV, transplantation, chemotherapy, biological agents eg anti-TNFα (see p265), diabetes, CKD including dialysis, silicosis, bariatric surgery, and recent close contact with pulmonary/laryngeal TB. Offer HIV, hepatitis B and C testing prior to treatment.

Treat with 3 months of isoniazid (with pyridoxine) and rifampicin OR 6 months of isoniazid (with pyridoxine).

If concerns about hepatotoxicity then 3 months of isoniazid and rifampicin may be preferred. In severe liver disease, seek specialist advice. If interactions with rifamycins are a concern (eg HIV, transplant) then 6 months of isoniazid may be preferred.

## Active TB

All forms of active TB are statutorily notifiable in UK. This includes both clinical and culture diagnoses. Notification is via your local public health protection team (www.gov.uk/health-protection-team). Treatment is given under the care of a specialist TB clinician/service according to table 9.10. Exceptions include:

- active CNS disease (including spinal cord involvement): continuation phase of treatment is extended from 4 to 10 months
- CNS and pericardial disease: use adjunctive high-dose steroids (with weaning and withdrawal during the intensive treatment period)
- drug-resistant TB.

Adherence is important for treatment to be effective and to prevent drug resistance. Directly observed therapy (DOT) should be considered if: previous treatment for TB, homelessness, drug/alcohol misuse, prison, psychiatric or cognitive disorder, multidrug resistant disease, patient request.

Universal access to diagnosis and treatment of TB is part of social justice. WHO has developed an 'End TB' strategy aiming to reduce TB deaths by 90% by 2030, and TB incidence by 90% by 2035 (www.who.int/tb/strategy/en).

## Drug-resistant TB

NAAT (p394) for drug resistance should be requested for all patients with risk factors for drug-resistance: previous TB treatment, contact with drug-resistant disease, birth or residence in a country where ≥5% new cases are drug resistant (fig 9.10).

Drug resistance may be:
- to any single agent in table 9.10.
- multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid.
- extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, one injectable agent (capreomycin, kanamycin or amikacin) and one fluoroquinolone.

If rifampicin resistance is detected, treat with at least six agents to which the mycobacterium is likely to be sensitive. Test for resistance to 2nd-line drugs. Remember infection control measures. Seek expert advice for all drug-resistant cases.
