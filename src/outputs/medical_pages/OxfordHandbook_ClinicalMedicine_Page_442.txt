# Gastroenteritis: an overview

Gastroenteritis = diarrhoea (± vomiting) due to enteric infection with viruses, bacteria, or parasites.

Diarrhoea can be defined as:
- acute diarrhoea: ≥3 episodes partially formed or watery stool/day for <14d
- dysentery: infectious gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhoea
- persistent diarrhoea: acutely starting diarrhoea lasting >14d
- traveller's diarrhoea: starting during, or shortly after, foreign travel
- food poisoning: disease (infection or toxin) caused by consumption of food/water.
  > Food poisoning is notifiable in the UK (www.gov.uk/health-protection-team).

Gastroenteritis can be classified according to infectious aetiology (table 9.24) or predominant clinical presentation (table 9.25, also see p259).

## Table 9.24 Gastroenteritis by infectious aetiology

| Infection | Organism | Incubation | Notes | Page |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------|------|
| Virus ~50-60% | Norovirus | 1d | Important cause of epidemic gastroenteritis. 600,000-1million cases/yr in UK. | 430 |
| | Rotavirus | 1-3d | Affects nearly all children by age 5y. Routine, childhood (live) vaccine in UK. | 430 |
| | Astrovirus | 4-5d | Often less severe than norovirus. | |
| | Adenovirus | 3-10d | Enteric adenovirus. Mainly children. | |
| | Sapovirus | 1-3d | Children. Not common in food-borne disease. | |
| | CMV | ~3-12wks | Usually asymptomatic. If immunosuppression: colitis, hepatitis, retinitis, pneumonia. | 400, 405 |
| Bacteria ~30-40% | Salmonella (non-typhoidal) | 12-72h | Under-cooked eggs, poultry, meat. | 431 |
| | Campylobacter | 2-5d | Under-cooked meat, cross-contamination, un-pasteurized milk, water. | 431 |
| | E. coli | 1-10d (usually 3-4d) | Bloody diarrhoea if Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) eg 0157. Can cause HUS. Under-cooked beef, unpasteurized milk most common. | 391, 429, 431 |
| | Shigella | 1-2d | S. sonnei most common. Deadly epidemics with S. dysenteriae in low-income countries. | 431 |
| | Staphylococcus aureus | 30min—6h | Unpasteurized milk/cheese, uncooked food. Multiplication leads to toxin production. | 388 |
| | Clostridium perfringens | 6-24h | Raw meat. Inadequately reheated food. | 430 |
| | Clostridium difficile | | Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Spore-forming therefore persists: wash your hands. | 411 |
| | Listeria | 3-70d | Cold meat, soft cheese, refrigerated pâté. Diarrhoea, fever, myalgia. †Severity in immunosuppression and pregnancy (bacteraemia, fetal loss). | 389 |
| | Vibrio cholerae | 2h-5d | Human and aquatic reservoirs. Epidemics due to inadequate environmental management. | 430 |
| | Yersinia enterocolitica | 4-7d | Main source is undercooked pork. Most infection in young children. | 431 |
| | Bacillus cereus | 30min—15h | Leftover food, rice. Emetic or diarrhoeal toxins. | |
| Parasites <2% | Giardia | 1-3wks | Intestinal parasite. Cyst transfer via infected faeces, eg contaminated water. Malabsorption. | 432 |
| | Cryptosporidium | 1-12d | Transfer via infected faeces. Symptoms and †severity with immunosuppression, eg HIV. | 400, 432 |
| | Entamoeba histolytica | 2-4wks (can be years) | Asymptomatic carrier, intestinal disease and/or extra-intestinal disease (liver, skin, lung, brain). | 432 |
| | Cyclospora cayetanensis | ~1wk | Transfer via infected faeces. May have relapsing course. | 433 |
| | Trichinella | 1-2d | Enteral at 1-2d. Parenteral at 2-8wks: larval migration, facial swelling, myocarditis, encephalitis. | 433 |
| | Trichuriasis | ~3months | Whipworm. Dysentery with heavy infection. | 433 |
| | Intestinal flukes | 4d—months | Eg Fasciolopsis buski. | |
