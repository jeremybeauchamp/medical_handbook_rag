# Anal cancer

**Incidence:** 1233 new cases of anal cancer in the UK (2013). **Risk factors:** Anoreceptive intercourse; HPV (HPV 16 associated with worse prognosis); HIV. **Histology:** Squamous cell (85%); rarely basaloid, melanoma, or adenocarcinoma. Anal margin tumours are usually well-differentiated, keratinizing lesions with a good prognosis. Anal canal tumours arise above dentate line, are poorly differentiated and non-keratinizing with a poorer prognosis. **Spread:** Tumours above the dentate line spread to pelvic lymph nodes; those below spread to the inguinal nodes. **Presentation:** Bleeding, pain, bowel habit change, pruritus ani, masses, stricture. **Î”:** Perianal warts; leucoplakia; lichen sclerosis; Bowen's disease; Crohn's disease. **Treatment:** Chemo-irradiation (radiotherapy + fluorouracil + mitomycin/cisplatin) is usually preferred to anorectal excision & colostomy; 75% retain normal anal function.

**Fig 13.43 Anatomy of the anal canal.** Perianal abscesses present as tender, inflamed, localized swellings at the anal verge. Ischiorectal abscesses are also tender but cause a diffuse, indurated swelling in the ischioanal fossa area. You will find your patient waiting anxiously for you, pacing about, or on the edge of their chair: avoiding all pressure is imperative. NB: above the dentate line = visceral nerve innervation (hence no pain sensation); below = somatic innervation (very sensitive to pain).
