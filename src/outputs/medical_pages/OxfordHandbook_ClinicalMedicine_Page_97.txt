# The breast: examination

1. **Inspection** Assess size and shape of any masses as well as overlying surface. Which quadrant (see fig 2.51)? Note skin involvement; ulceration, dimpling (peau d'orange), and nipple inversion/discharge.

2. **Palpation of the breast** Confirm size, and shape of any lump. Is it fixed/tethered to skin or underlying structures (see BOX 2 'Palpation')? Is it fluctuant/compressible/hard? Temperature? Tender? Mobile (more likely to be fibroadenoma)?

3. **Palpation of the axilla for lymph nodes** Metastatic spread? Ipsilateral/bilateral? Matted? Fixed?

4. **Further examination** Examine abdomen for hepatomegaly, spine for tenderness, lungs (metastatic spread).

## 1 General inspection
> Always have a chaperone present when examining the breast.

Introduction, consent, position patient sitting at edge of bed with hands by her side, expose to waist. Inspect both breasts for obvious masses, contour anomalies, asymmetry, scars, ulceration, skin changes, eg peau d'orange (orange peel appearance resulting from oedema). Look for nipple inversion and nipple discharge. Ask her to 'press hands on hips' and then 'hands on head' to accentuate any asymmetrical changes. While patient has her hands raised inspect axillae for any masses as well as inspecting under the breasts.

## 2 Palpation of the breast
Position patient sitting back at 45° with hand behind head (ie right hand behind head when examining the right breast—see fig 2.50). Ask patient if she has any pain or discharge. Examine painful areas last and then ask her to express any discharge. Examine each breast with the 'normal' side first. Examine each quadrant in turn as well as the axillary tail of Spence (fig 2.51) or use a concentric spiral method (fig 2.52) using a flat hand to roll breast against underlying chest wall. Define any lumps/lumpy areas. If you discover a lump, to examine for fixity to the pectoral muscles ask the patient to push against your hand with her arm outstretched.

## 3 Palpation of the axilla
Examine both axillae. When examining right axilla, hold the patient's right arm with your right hand and examine axilla with left hand.

Five sets of axillary nodes:
i) apical (palpate against glenohumeral joint)
ii) anterior (palpate against pectoralis major)
iii) central (palpate against lateral chest wall)
iv) posterior (palpate against latissimus dorsi)
v) medial (palpate against humerus).

## 4 Further examination
Complete examination by palpating down spine for tenderness, examining abdomen for hepatomegaly, and lungs for signs of metastases. Thank patient and wash hands.
