# Localizing features

## Temporal lobe:
- Dysphasia (p86).
- Contralateral homonymous hemianopia (or upper quadrantanopia if only Meyer's loop affected).
- Amnesia.
- Many odd or seemingly inexplicable phenomena, p491.

## Frontal lobe:
- Hemiparesis.
- Personality change (indecent, indolent, indiscreet, facetious, tendency to pun).
- Release phenomena such as the grasp reflex (fingers drawn across palm are grasped), significant only if unilateral.
- Broca's dysphasia (p86), or more subtle difficulty with initiating and planning speech with intact repetition and no anomia—but loss of coherence.
- Unilateral anosmia (loss of smell).
- Perseveration (unable to switch from one line of thinking to another).
- Executive dysfunction (unable to plan tasks).
- Verbal fluency.

## Parietal lobe:
- Hemisensory loss.
- 2-point discrimination.
- Astereognosis (unable to recognize an object by touch alone).
- Sensory inattention.
- Dysphasia (p86).
- Gerstmann's syndrome (p700).

## Occipital lobe:
- Contralateral visual field defects.
- Palinopsia (persisting images once the stimulus has left the field of view).
- Polyopia (seeing multiple images).

## Cerebellum:
Remember DANISH: 
- **D**ysdiadochokinesis (impaired rapidly alternating movements, p67) and 
- **D**ysmetria (past-pointing); 
- **A**taxia (limb/truncal—but if truncal ataxia is worse on eye closure, blame the dorsal columns); 
- **N**ystagmus; 
- **I**ntention tremor; 
- **S**lurred speech (dysarthria); 
- **H**ypotonia.

## Cerebellopontine angle:
(Eg acoustic neuroma/vestibular Schwannoma; p462.)
Ipsilateral deafness, nystagmus, corneal reflex, facial weakness (rare), ipsilateral cerebellar signs (above), papilloedema, VIth nerve palsy (p70).

## Midbrain:
(Eg pineal tumours or midbrain infarction.) Failure of up or down gaze; light-near dissociated pupil responses (p72), nystagmus on convergent gaze.
