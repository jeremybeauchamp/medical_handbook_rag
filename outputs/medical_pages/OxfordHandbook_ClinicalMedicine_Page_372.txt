# Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)

CML is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid cells (fig 8.54). It accounts for 15% of leukaemias. It is a myeloproliferative disorder (p366) having features in common with these diseases, eg splenomegaly. It occurs most often between 40-60yrs, with a slight male predominance, and is rare in childhood.

**Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)** Present in >80% of those with CML. It is a hybrid chromosome comprising reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosome 9 and the long arm of chromosome 22—t(9;22)—forming a fusion gene BCR/ABL on chromosome 22, which has tyrosine kinase activity. Those without Ph have a worse prognosis. Some patients have a masked translocation—cytogenetics do not show the Ph, but the rearrangement is detectable by molecular techniques.

**Symptoms** Mostly chronic and insidious: ↓weight, tiredness, fever, sweats. There may be features of gout (due to purine breakdown), bleeding (platelet dysfunction), and abdominal discomfort (splenic enlargement). ~30% are detected by chance.

**Signs** Splenomegaly (>75%)—often massive. Hepatomegaly, anaemia, bruising (fig 8.55).

**Tests** ↑↑WBC (often >100×10⁹/L) with whole spectrum of myeloid cells, ie neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils. Hb ↓ or →, platelets variable. ↑Urate, ↑B₁₂. Bone marrow hypercellular. Cytogenetic analysis of blood or bone marrow for Ph.

**Natural history** Variable, median survival 5-6yrs. There are three phases: Chronic, lasting months or years of few, if any, symptoms. • Accelerated phase, with increasing symptoms, spleen size, and difficulty in controlling counts. • Blast transformation, with features of acute leukaemia ± death. Treatment See BOX.

## Treating CML

CML is the first example of a cancer where knowledge of the genotype has led to a specifically targeted drug—imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This has transformed therapy over the last 10yrs. Side effects are usually mild: nausea, cramps, oedema, rash, headache, arthralgia. May cause myelosuppression.

More potent 2nd-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors: dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. Dasatinib and nilotinib allow more patients to achieve deeper, more rapid responses associated with improved outcomes, and dasatinib has been used in imatinib-resistant blast crises (though NICE says that it is often not cost-effective). Hydroxycarbamide is also used.

Those with lymphoblastic transformation may benefit from treatment as for ALL. Treatment of myeloblastic transformation with chemotherapy rarely achieves lasting remission, and allogeneic transplantation offers the best hope.

Stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor offers the only cure, but carries significant morbidity and mortality. Guidelines suggest that this approach should be only rarely used 1st line in young patients (where mortality rates are lower). Other patients should be offered a BCR-ABL inhibitor. Patients are then reviewed annually to decide whether to continue, to offer combination therapy or stem cell transplantation.
