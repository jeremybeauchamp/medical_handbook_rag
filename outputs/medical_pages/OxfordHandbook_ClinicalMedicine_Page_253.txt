## Signs of acromegaly

- Growth of hands (fig 5.29b; may be spade-like), jaw (fig 5.29a) and feet (sole may encroach on the dorsum).
- Coarsening face; wide nose.
- Big supraorbital ridges.
- Macroglossia (big tongue).
- Widely spaced teeth.
- Puffy lips, eyelids, and skin (oily and large-pored); also skin tags.
- Scalp folds (cutis verticis gyrata; due to expanding but tethered skin).
- Skin darkening (fig 5.29).
- Acanthosis nigricans (fig 12.28, p563).
- Laryngeal dyspnoea (fixed cords).
- Obstructive sleep apnoea.
- Goitre (thyroid vascularity).
- Proximal weakness + arthropathy.
- Carpal tunnel signs in 50%, p503.
- Signs from any pituitary mass: hypopituitarism Â± local mass effect (p232; vision; hemianopia); fits.

## Dysmorphia, personal identity, and acromegaly

We might have devoted this box to a grotesque homunculus depicting the signs of acromegaly: all disconnected lips, hands, feet, brows, and noses. But our integrative ethics disallow this, and ask us instead to see if acromegaly can reveal something universal about our patients and ourselves. What is it like to feel in the grip of some 'alien puberty' or 'empty pregnancy'? These analogies are physiological as well as metaphorical.[^14][^15] The changes of acromegaly are not so insidious that the patient thinks all is fine: there is often partial knowledge and a few dark thoughts on looking into the mirror. Even when we lay our lives end-to-end for inspection (fig 5.28), changes are subtle. It can take the observations of others to force us to come face-to-face with the truth of our new unfolding self. In one patient the comment was 'So are you pregnant again?' 'Why do you ask?' 'Because your nose is as big as it was when you were last pregnant'. So here we have the well-known 'physiological acromegaly of pregnancy'[^14] predating the pathological, as the carnival of personal identity moves from helter-skelter to roller-coaster.

[^14]: GH variants made by the placenta rise exponentially until 37wks' gestation; pituitary GH gradually drops to near-undetectable levels. 'Gestational acromegaly' probably develops to foster fetoplacental growth; its side-effects include facial oedema, carpal tunnel symptoms, and nose enlargement.

[^15]: Puberty sees GH- and gonad-mediated rises in bone and muscle mass + other 'acromegalic' effects.
