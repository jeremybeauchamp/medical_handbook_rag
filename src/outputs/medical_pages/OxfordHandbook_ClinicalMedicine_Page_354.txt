# 340 Sickle-cell anaemia

Sickle-cell anaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder in which production of abnormal haemoglobin results in vaso-occlusive crises. It is most commonly seen in people of African origin, and arises from an amino acid substitution in the gene coding for the β chain (Glu → Val at position 6) which leads to production of HbS rather than HbA (HbA2 and HbF are still produced). Homozygotes (SS) have sickle-cell anaemia (HbSS), and heterozygotes (HbAS) have sickle-cell trait, which causes no disability (and protects from falciparum malaria). Heterozygotes may still, however, experience symptomatic sickling in hypoxia, eg in unpressurized aircraft or anaesthesia (so all those of African descent need a pre-op sickle-cell test).

## Pathogenesis
HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing RBCs to deform, producing sickle cells, which are fragile and haemolyse, and also block small vessels.

## Prevalence
1:700 people of African descent.

## Tests
Haemolysis is variable. Hb ≈ 60-90g/L, ↑reticulocytes 10-20%, ↑bilirubin. Film: sickle cells and target cells (fig 8.37). Sickle solubility test: +ve, but does not distinguish between HbSS and HbAS. Hb electrophoresis: Confirms the diagnosis and distinguishes SS, AS states, and other Hb variants. ▶Aim for diagnosis at birth (cord blood) to aid prompt pneumococcal prophylaxis (vaccine, p167 ± penicillin V).

## Signs/symptoms
Chronic haemolysis is usually well tolerated (except in crises; see BOX 'Managing sickle-cell crises').

Vaso-occlusive 'painful' crisis: Common, due to microvascular occlusion. Often affects the marrow, causing severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or hypoxia. Hands and feet are affected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may cause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen. CNS infarction occurs in ~10% of children, leading to stroke, seizures, or cognitive defects. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography indicates risk of impending stroke, and blood transfusions can prevent this by reducing HbS. Also avascular necrosis (eg of femoral head), leg ulcers (fig 8.38) and low-flow priapism (also seen in CML, may respond to hydration, α-agonists, eg phenylephrine, or aspiration of blood + irrigation with saline; if for >12h prompt cavernosus-spongiosum shunting can prevent later impotence).

Aplastic crisis: This is due to parvovirus B19, with sudden reduction in marrow production, especially RBCs. Usually self-limiting <2wks; transfusion may be needed.

Sequestration crisis: Mainly affects children as in adults the spleen becomes atrophic. There is pooling of blood in the spleen ± liver, with organomegaly, severe anaemia, and shock. Urgent transfusion is needed.

## Complications
- Splenic infarction occurs before 2yrs old, due to microvascular occlusion, leading to ↑susceptibility to infection (40% of childhood sickle deaths are caused this way).
- Poor growth.
- Chronic renal failure.
- Gallstones.
- Retinal disease.
- Iron overload (see BOX 'A 7-year-old ...').
- Lung damage: hypoxia→fibrosis→pulmonary hypertension.

## Management of chronic disease
▶Get help from a haematologist.
- Hydroxycarbamide if frequent crises (↑production of fetal haemoglobin, HbF). Dose example: 20mg/kg/d if eGFR >60mL/min.
- Splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism and immunocompromise. Prophylaxis, in terms of antibiotics and immunization, should be given (p373).
- Febrile children risk septicaemia: repeated admission may be avoided by early rescue out-patient antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (eg 2 doses, 50mg/kg IV on day 0 and 1). Consider admission if Hb <50g/L, WCC <5 or >30 × 10⁹/L, T° >40°C, severe pain, dehydration, lung infiltration. Seek expert advice.
- Bone marrow transplant can be curative but remains controversial.

## Prevention
Genetic counselling; prenatal tests (OHCS pp154-5). Parental education can help prevent 90% of deaths from sequestration crises.
