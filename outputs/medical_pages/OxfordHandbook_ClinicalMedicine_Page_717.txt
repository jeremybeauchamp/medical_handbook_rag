# Guillain-Barré polyneuritis

## Table 15.2 Diagnostic criteria

| Features required for | Features supporting diagnosis |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Progressive weakness of >1 limb | • Progression over days, up to 4wks |
| Areflexia | • Near symmetry of sytoms |
| **Features making diagnosis doubtful** | • Sensory symptoms/signs only mild |
| • Sensory level | • CN involvement (eg bilateral facial weakness) |
| • Marked, persistent asymmetry of weakness | • Recovery starts ~2wks after the period of progression has finished |
| • Severe bowel and bladder dysfunction | • Autonomic dysfunction |
| • CSF WCC >50 | • Absence of fever at onset |
|  | • CSF protein ↑ with CSF WCC <10×10⁶/L |
|  | • Typical electrophysiological tests |

Variants of Guillain-Barré syndrome include:

**Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (CIDP)**: Characterized by a slower onset and recovery.

**Miller Fisher syndrome**: Comprises of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies in the serum.
