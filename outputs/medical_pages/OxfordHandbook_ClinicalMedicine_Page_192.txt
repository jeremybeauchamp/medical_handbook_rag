# Asthma

Asthma affects 5-8% of the population. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of dyspnoea, cough, and wheeze caused by reversible airways obstruction. Three factors contribute to airway narrowing: bronchial muscle contraction, triggered by a variety of stimuli; mucosal swelling/inflammation, caused by mast cell and basophil degranulation resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators; and increased mucus production.

**Symptoms** Intermittent dyspnoea, wheeze, cough (often nocturnal), and sputum (see table 4.5).

**Precipitants:** Cold air, exercise, emotion, allergens (house dust mite, pollen, fur), infection, smoking and passive smoking, pollution, NSAIDs, β-blockers.

**Diurnal variation** Symptoms or peak flow may vary over the day. Marked morning dipping of peak flow is common and can tip the balance into a serious attack, despite having normal peak flow (fig 4.12) at other times.

**Exercise:** Quantify the exercise tolerance.

**Disturbed sleep:** Quantify as nights per week (a sign of severe asthma).

**Acid reflux:** 40-60% of those with asthma have reflux; treating it improves spirometry, but not necessarily symptoms.

**Other atopic disease:** Eczema, hay fever, allergy, or family history?

**The home (especially the bedroom):** Pets? Carpet? Feather pillows or duvet? Floor cushions and other 'soft furnishings'?

**Job:** If symptoms remit at weekends or holidays, work may provide the trigger (15% of cases are work-related—more for paint sprayers, food processors, welders, and animal handlers). Ask the patient to measure their peak flow at intervals at work and at home (at the same time of day) to confirm this (see fig 4.13).

**Days per week off work or school.**

**Signs** Tachypnoea; audible wheeze; hyperinflated chest; hyper-resonant percussion note; ↓air entry; widespread, polyphonic wheeze. Severe attack: Inability to complete sentences; pulse >110bpm; respiratory rate >25/min; PEF 33-50% predicted. Life-threatening attack: Silent chest; confusion; exhaustion; cyanosis (PaO₂ <8kPa but PaCO₂ 4.6-6.0, SpO₂ <92%); bradycardia; PEF <33% predicted. Near fatal: ↑PaCO₂.

**Tests Initial diagnosis:** See figs 4.10, 4.11. Acute attack: PEF, sputum culture, FBC, U&E, CRP, blood cultures. ABG analysis usually shows a normal or slightly ↓PaO₂ but ↓PaCO₂ (hyperventilation). If PaO₂ is normal but the patient is hyperventilating, watch carefully and repeat the ABG a little later. ►If PaCO₂ is normal or raised, transfer to high-dependency unit or ITU for ventilation, as this signifies failing respiratory effort. CXR (to exclude infection or pneumothorax). Chronic asthma: PEF monitoring (p162): a diurnal variation of >20% on ≥3d a wk for 2wks. Spirometry: obstructive defect (↓FEV₁/FVC, ↑RV p162); usually ≥15% improvement in FEV₁ following β₂ agonists or steroid trial. CXR: hyperinflation. Skin-prick tests may help to identify allergens. Histamine or methacholine challenge. Aspergillus serology.

**Differential diagnosis** Pulmonary oedema ('cardiac asthma'); COPD (may co-exist); large airway obstruction (eg foreign body, tumour); SVC obstruction (wheeze/dyspnoea not episodic); pneumothorax; PE; bronchiectasis; obliterative bronchiolitis (suspect in elderly).

**Treatment** Chronic asthma (p182). Emergency treatment (p810).

**Associated diseases** Acid reflux; polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, p556); Churg-Strauss syndrome (p696); ABPA (p177).

**Natural history** Most childhood asthmatics (see OHCS p164) either grow out of asthma in adolescence or suffer much less as adults. A significant number of people develop chronic asthma late in life.

**Mortality** ~900 asthma deaths in the UK in 2012, 50% were >65yrs old.
