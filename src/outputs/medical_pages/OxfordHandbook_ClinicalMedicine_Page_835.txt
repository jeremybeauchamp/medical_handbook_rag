# Immediate management if shocked

1. Protect airway and keep NBM
   Insert two large-bore cannulae (14-16G)

2. Urgent bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, glucose, clotting
   screen, crossmatch 4-6 units

3. Rapid IV crystalloid infusion up to 1L

4. If signs of grade III or IV shock (p790) give blood
   Group specific or O Rh-ve until crossmatch done

5. Otherwise continue IV fluids to
   maintain BP and transfuse if eg Hb <7

6. Correct clotting abnormalities
   Vitamin K, FFP, platelet concentrate

7. If risk of varices (eg known liver disease or
   alcohol excess), give terlipressin IV 1-2mg/6h and
   broad-spectrum IV antibiotics

8. Consider referral to ICU or HDU, and consider CVP
   line to guide fluid replacement. Aim for >5cmH2O
   CVP may mislead if there is ascites or CCF

9. Catheterize and monitor urine output. Aim for >30mL/h

10. Monitor vital signs every 15min until stable, then hourly

11. Notify surgeons of all severe bleeds

12. Urgent endoscopy for diagnosis Â± control of bleeding
    at the earliest possible point after adequate resuscitation
