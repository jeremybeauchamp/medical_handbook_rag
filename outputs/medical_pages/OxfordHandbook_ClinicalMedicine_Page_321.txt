## When a patient on dialysis presents... 307

1. Do they need dialysis now? Examine for fluid overload and check K+. If on PD are they well enough to perform it themselves? Refer urgently to renal on-call.

2. When will they need dialysis? When are they due to dialyse next? Weigh them. All patients on dialysis have a target weight at which they are considered euvolaemic. How much are they above it? Do they have any useful urine output (ie that may help them lose volume/K+)? Refer to renal in a timely manner.

3. What is your diagnosis? History and examination as for any other patient. Do not measure BP on fistula arm. Remember risk for CVD but troponin has specificity in ESRF.

4. Treat. Remember to dose adjust for renal failure—includes antibiotics, opiates, insulin, and low-molecular-weight heparin (see www.renaldrugdatabase.com, p305). Care with fluid replacement in sepsis: be guided by clinical examination and target weight. If unsure get expert help. If volume depleted give a 250mL bolus of (non-K+ containing) crystalloid over 15min with close observation. Avoid maintenance fluids in those who normally have a fluid restriction. Do not use a dialysis line or fistula for IV access—if a cannula is necessary, preferentially use the back of the hand, save other vessels for future fistulas.

5. Surgery needs senior anaesthetic and renal input. Aim for pre-op K+ <5.5mmol/L (<5.0mmol/L if major surgery with risk of tissue breakdown/ haemolysis). Check K+ urgently post-op (venous gas in recovery). In elective surgery, plan dialysis provision pre- and post-op.

## Warning: there is no normal

Ten years is a long time. For those ten years, or just over 3,560 times, I attached myself to a peritoneal dialysis machine and underwent nine hours and fifty minutes of nightly therapy. I subsequently learned to do a lot of crosswords and read a ridiculous amount of books. In ten years I had just three incidents: an inguinal hernia due to thinking that I could move a sofa (I could not), a parathyroidectomy (my knees were much happier afterwards), and one unfortunate bout of peritonitis (once was enough). Statistically speaking, I am an anomaly: the 'average' life span of a peritoneal dialysis patient is four years.

Admittedly, I did not initially cope well with needing to be on dialysis. After having lived successfully with a transplant, a return to dialysis felt like failure. I did not want the hassle of treatment. I did not want piles of boxes cluttering up our home. Mostly, I did not want a PD catheter jutting out of my belly. But what I originally believed to be unacceptable, gradually became tolerable. This took time. It took care and support. It took experiencing relative health, and seeing that dialysis life, although different to existing with a transplant, could be lived well.

## The man in a red canoe who saved a million lives

Mostly we commute to work each day driven by motives we would rather not look at too deeply. But one renal physician used a red canoe to commute each day from his houseboat to the hospital. He could have been a very rich man but instead Belding Scribner gave his invention away, and continued his modest existence.

He invented the Scribner shunt—a U of teflon connecting an artery to a vein, allowing haemodialysis to be something that could be repeated as often as needed. Before Scribner, glass tubes had to be painfully inserted into blood vessels, which would be damaged by the procedure so that haemodialysis could be done for only a few cycles. Clyde Shields was his first patient in 1960, and said that his first treatment 'took so much of the waste I'd stored up out of me that it was just like turning on the light from darkness'. Scribner took something that was 100% fatal and turned it into a condition with a 90% survival.

On 19 June 2003, his canoe was found afloat but empty. And like those ancient Indian burial canoes found at Wiskam which have been polished to an unimaginable lustre by the action of the shifting sands around the Island of the Dead, so we polish and cherish the image of this man who gave everything away to help others.
