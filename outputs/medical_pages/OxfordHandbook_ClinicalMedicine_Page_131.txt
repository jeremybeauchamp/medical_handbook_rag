# Investigating patients with ? stable angina

Investigations for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) include:
• Exercise ECG—assess for ischaemic ECG changes.
• Angiography—either using cardiac CT with contrast, or transcatheter angiography (more invasive but can be combined with stenting, p112).
• Functional imaging (see p108): myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echo (echo whilst undergoing exercise or receiving dobutamine), cardiac MRI.

NICE recommend the following investigations when considering stable angina:

## Typical angina in a patient with previously proven IHD:
Treat as stable angina; if further confirmation is required, use non-invasive testing, eg exercise ECG.

## Typical and atypical angina:
CT angiography, fig 3.20. If inconclusive, use functional imaging as 2nd line and transcatheter angiography as 3rd line.

## Non-anginal chest pain:
Does the patient have ischaemic changes on 12 lead ECG?
• Yes: investigate as per typical and atypical angina
• No: no further investigations for IHD at this point (unless high clinical suspicion of IHD for other reasons—discuss with a specialist). Ensure alternative chest pain diagnoses are adequately explored.

These are guidelines and must be interpreted within the clinical context.

## Further investigations:
If the patient has typical angina but few risk factors for IHD, be sure to look for possible precipitating or exacerbating factors, for example severe anaemia or cardiomyopathy.

## Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal angina)

Angina due to coronary artery spasm, which can occur even in normal coronary arteries. The pain usually occurs during rest and resolves rapidly with short-acting nitrates (eg GTN spray). ECG during pain shows ST segment elevation.

### Risks and triggers: 
Smoking increases risk but hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia do not. Probable triggers include cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, low magnesium, and artery instrumentation (eg during angiography).

### Treatment: 
Avoid triggers. Correct low magnesium. Stop smoking. PRN GTN. Calcium channel blockers ± long-acting nitrates. Avoid non-selective β-blockers, aspirin, and triptans. Prognosis is usually very good.
