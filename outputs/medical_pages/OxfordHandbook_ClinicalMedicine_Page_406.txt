# Tuberculosis (TB): presentation

## Epidemiology
- 9.6 million new cases/yr of which 37% are unreported/undiagnosed (fig 9.8).
- 3.3% of new cases, and 20% of previously treated cases are drug resistant (p395).
- Co-infection with HIV in 12% of new cases.
- Leading cause of death worldwide, 1.5 million deaths/yr.
- Effective diagnosis and treatment saved 43 million lives between 2000 and 2014.
- UK: ~8000/yr, ~12 per 100 000. 73% born outside UK, 70% in deprived areas, 30% with pulmonary disease wait >4 months from symptoms to treatment.

## Pathophysiology
Caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

**Active infection** occurs when containment by the immune system (T-cells/macrophages) is inadequate. It can arise from primary infection, or re-activation of previously latent disease. Transmission of TB is via inhalation of aerosol droplets containing bacterium. This means only pulmonary disease is communicable.

**Latent TB** is infection without disease due to persistent immune system containment (ie granuloma formation prevents bacteria growth and spread). Positive skin/blood testing (p394) shows evidence of infection but the patient is asymptomatic and non-infectious (normal sputum/CXR). ~2 billion persons worldwide (~⅓ of world's population) are estimated to have latent TB. Lifetime risk of reactivation is 5-10%. Risk factors for reactivation: new infection (<2y), HIV, organ transplantation, immunosuppression (including corticosteroids), silicosis, illicit drug use, malnutrition, high-risk settings (homeless shelter, prison), low socio-economic status, haemodialysis.

## Presentation
TB, or not TB—that is the question. Maintain a high index of suspicion. TB can affect any organ in the body (table 9.9).
