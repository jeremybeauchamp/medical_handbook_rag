Table 10.11 Clinical patterns of nerve root impingement

| Nerve root | Motor and sensory deficit | Pain pattern |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| C5 (C4/C5 disc) | Weak deltoid & supraspinatus; supinator jerks; numb elbow. | Pain in neck/shoulder that radiates down front of arm to elbow. |
| C6 (C5/C6 disc) | Weak biceps & brachioradialis; biceps jerks; numb thumb & index finger. | Pain in shoulder radiating down arm below elbow.* |
| C7 (C6/C7 disc) | Weak triceps & finger extension; triceps jerks; numb middle finger. | Pain in upper arm and dorsal fore-arm. |
