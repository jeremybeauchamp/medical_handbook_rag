## Lung function tests
PEF, FEV1, FVC (see p162). Total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) are useful in distinguishing obstructive and restrictive diseases (see fig 4.4). TLC and RV are increased in obstructive airways disease and reduced in restrictive lung diseases and musculoskeletal abnormalities. The gas transfer coefficient (KCO) represents the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) corrected for alveolar volume. It is calculated by measuring carbon monoxide uptake from a single inspiration in a standard time (usually 10s) and lung volume by helium dilution. Low in emphysema and interstitial lung disease, high in alveolar haemorrhage. Flow-volume loop (see fig 4.5) measures flow at various lung volumes. Characteristic patterns are seen with intra-thoracic airways obstruction (asthma, emphysema) and extra-thoracic airways obstruction (tracheal stenosis).

## Radiology
- **Chest x-ray:** See p722. 
- **Ultrasound:** Used in diagnosing and guiding drainage of pleural effusions (particularly loculated effusions) and empyema. 
- **Radionuclide scans:** Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q, p738) scans are occasionally used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), eg in pregnancy (unmatched perfusion defects are seen). Bone scans are used to diagnose bone metastases. PET scans to assess cancer and inflammation. 
- **Computed tomography:** (CT, p730) Used for diagnosing and staging lung cancer, imaging the hila, mediastinum, and pleura, and guiding biopsies. Thin (1-1.5mm) section high-resolution CT (HRCT) is used in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and bronchiectasis. CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used in the diagnosis of PE. 
- **Pulmonary angiography:** Now rarely used for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension.

## Fibreoptic bronchoscopy
Performed under local anaesthetic via the nose or mouth. 
- **Diagnostic indications:** Suspected lung carcinoma, slowly resolving pneumonia, pneumonia in the immunosuppressed, interstitial lung disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may be sent to the lab for microscopy, culture, and cytology. Mucosal abnormalities may be brushed (cytology) and biopsied (histopathology).
- **Therapeutic indications:** Aspiration of mucus plugs causing lobar collapse, removal of foreign bodies, stenting or treating tumours, eg laser. 
- **Pre-procedure investigations:** FBC, coagulation, CXR, CT, spirometry, pulse oximetry, and ABG (if indicated).
- **Complications:** Hypoxia, bleeding, pneumothorax (fig 16.43, p749). 
- **Diagnostic sensitivity** for cancer 50-90%, depends on tumour location; gene profiling of cell sample may improve this. May also be used to deliver an ultrasound probe (endobronchial ultrasound), and treatmentsâ€”eg stents, or cryotherapy.

## Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
Is performed at the time of bronchoscopy by instilling and aspirating a known volume of warmed, buffered 0.9% saline into the distal airway. 
- **Diagnostic indications:** Suspected malignancy, pneumonia, in the immunosuppressed (especially HIV), bronchiectasis, suspected TB (if sputum negative), interstitial lung diseases (eg sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, histiocytosis X).
- **Therapeutic indications:** alveolar proteinosis. 
- **Complications:** Hypoxia (give supplemental O2), transient fever, transient CXR shadow, infection (rare).

## Lung biopsy
May be performed in several ways. Percutaneous needle biopsy is performed under radiological guidance and is useful for peripheral lung and pleural lesions. Transbronchial biopsy performed at bronchoscopy may help in diagnosing interstitial lung diseases, eg sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
- **Alternatives:** If unsuccessful, consider open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopy.

## Surgical procedures
Are performed under general anaesthetic. 
- **Rigid bronchoscopy** provides a wide lumen, enables larger mucosal biopsies, control of bleeding, and removal of foreign bodies. 
- **Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy** enable examination and biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes/lesions. 
- **Thoracoscopy** allows examination and biopsy of pleural lesions, drainage of pleural effusions, and talc pleurodesis and pleurectomy.

1. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis causes cough, dyspnoea, and restrictive spirometry. It is caused by accumulation of surfactant-derived acidophilic phospholipid/protein compounds which fill alveoli and distal bronchioles. Diagnosis may require lung biopsy. Cause: primary genetic or antibody problem, or secondary to inflammation caused by inhaling silica, aluminium, or titanium.
