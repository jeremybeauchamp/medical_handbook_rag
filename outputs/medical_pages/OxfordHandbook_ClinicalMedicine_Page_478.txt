# Hearing loss

**Whisper test** A simple but effective crude assessment of hearing: whisper numbers in one ear while blocking the other. Ask your patient to repeat the number. Make sure that failure is not from misunderstanding.

**Tuning fork tests** *Rinne*: Hold a vibrating tuning fork (512Hz or 256Hz) on the mastoid to test bone conduction (BC). When the sound is no longer audible move it in front of the ear with the prongs perpendicular to the auditory canal to test air conduction (AC). If there is no conductive deficit (ie in normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss), AC is better than BC and the patient will be able to hear the note again. This is a 'Rinne positive' result. If BC is better than AC (Rinne negative), this indicates conductive deafness >20dB. A false-negative may occur in severe sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as the contralateral cochlea picks up the sound by bone conduction.

*Weber*: With the vibrating tuning fork on the vertex or forehead, ask the patient which ear the sound is louder in. Sound localizes to the affected ear with conductive loss (>10dB loss), to the contralateral ear in SNHL, and to the midline if both ears are normal (or if bilateral SNHL).

**Conductive deafness** *Causes*: Wax (remove, eg by syringing with warm water after softening with olive oil drops), otosclerosis, otitis media, or glue ear (OHCS p546).

**Chronic sensorineural deafness** Often due to accumulated environmental noise toxicity, presbyacusis, or inherited disorders. *Presbyacusis*: Loss of acuity for high-frequency sounds starts before 30yrs old. We do not usually notice it until hearing of speech is affected. Hearing is most affected in the presence of background noise. Hearing aids are the usual treatment.

**Sudden sensorineural deafness** ▶Get an ENT opinion today (steroids may cure)!
*Causes*: Noise exposure; gentamicin/other toxin; mumps; acoustic neuroma; MS; stroke; vasculitis; TB. *Tests*: ESR, FBC, LFT, pANCA, viral titres and TB (see BOX 'Diagnostic tests for TB', p394); evoked response audiometry; CXR; MRI; lymph node and nasopharyngeal biopsy for culture.

# Tinnitus

This ringing or buzzing in the ears is common, and may cause depression or insomnia.
▶Investigate unilateral tinnitus fully to exclude an acoustic neuroma (p462).

**Causes** Inner ear damage and hearing loss (leading to auditory cortex hyper-excitability), wax, excess noise, head injury, otitis media, post-stapedectomy, Ménière's, anaemia (if pulsatile then think of carotid artery stenosis or dissection, AV fistulae, and glomus jugulare tumours). *Drugs*: Aspirin (reversible), loop diuretics, aminoglycosides. *Mean age at onset*: 40-50yrs. ♂:♀≈1:1.

**Management** Exclude serious causes. ▶Psychological support is very important: reassure that tinnitus does not mean madness or serious disease and that it often improves in time. *Cognitive therapy* helps, as do 'tinnitus coping training' and patient support groups. *Drugs* are disappointing: anticonvulsants (eg carbamazepine) are not of benefit; misoprostol appears to help (small-scale trials only); hypnotics at night may be of some benefit. Avoid tranquillizers, particularly if depressed (use tricyclic antidepressants here). If Ménière's disease is the cause, betahistine helps only a few. *Masking* may give relief: white noise (like an off-tuned radio) is given via a noise generator worn like a post-aural hearing aid. *Hearing aids* may help by amplifying desirable sounds. *Cochlear nerve section* is a drastic option that can relieve disabling tinnitus in 25% but at the expense of deafness.
