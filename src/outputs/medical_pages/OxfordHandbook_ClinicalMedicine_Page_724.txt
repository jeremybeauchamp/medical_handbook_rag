## Eponymous syndromes

### Refsum disease
Phytanic acid accumulates in tissues and serum, due to PHYH or PEX7 gene mutation (recessive). This leads to anosmia (a universal finding) and early-onset retinitis pigmentosa, with variable combinations of neuropathy, deafness, ataxia, ichthyosis, and cardiomyopathy. 
**Tests:** Plasma phytanic acid. 
**Rx:** Restrict foods containing phytanic acid (animal fats, dairy products, green leafy vegetables); plasmapheresis is used for severe symptoms.

*Sigvald Bernhard Refsum, 1907-1991 (Norwegian physician)*

### Romano-Ward syndrome
A dominant mutation in a K+ channel subunit causes long QT syndrome ± episodic VT, VF, torsades, ± sudden death. (Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syn is similar, p702.)

*Cesarino Romano, 1924-2008 (Italian paediatrician); Owen C Ward, b1923 (Irish paediatrician)*

### Rotor syndrome
A rare, benign, autosomal recessive disorder. Primary non-haemolytic conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, with almost normal hepatic histology (no pigmentation, in contrast to DJS, p698). Typically presents in childhood with mild jaundice. Cholescintigraphy reveals an 'absent' liver.

*Arturo Belleza Rotor, 1907-1988 (Filipino physician)*

### Sister Mary Joseph nodule
An umbilical metastatic nodule from an intra-abdominal malignancy (fig 15.17).

*Sister Mary Joseph Dempsey, 1856-1939 (US catholic nun & Dr William Mayo's surgical assistant)*

### Sjögren's syndrome
A chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder, which may be primary (♀:♂≈9:1, onset 4th-5th decade) or secondary, associated with connective tissue disease (eg RA, SLE, systemic sclerosis). There is lymphocytic infiltration and fibrosis of exocrine glands, especially lacrimal and salivary glands. 
**Features:** ↓Tear production (dry eyes, keratoconjunctivitis sicca), ↓salivation (xerostomia—dry mouth, caries), parotid swelling. Other glands are affected causing vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, dry cough, and dysphagia. Systemic signs include polyarthritis/arthralgia, Raynaud's, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis, lung, liver, and kidney involvement, peripheral neuropathy, myositis, and fatigue. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases (eg thyroid disease, autoimmune hepatitis, PBC) and an ↑risk of non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma. 
**Tests:** Schirmer's test measures conjunctival dryness (<5mm in 5min is +ve). Rose Bengal staining may show keratitis (use a slit-lamp). Anti-Ro (SSA; in 40%) & anti-La (SSB; in 26%) antibodies may be present (in pregnancy, these cross the placenta and cause fetal congenital heart block in 5%). ANA is usually +ve (74%); rheumatoid factor is +ve in 38%. There may be hypergammaglobulinaemia. Biopsy shows focal lymphocytic aggregation. 
**Rx:** Treat sicca symptoms: eg hypromellose (artificial tears), frequent drinks, sugar-free pastilles/gum. NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine are used for arthralgia. Immunosuppressants may be indicated in severe systemic disease.

*Henrik Conrad Samuel Sjögren, 1899-1986 (Swedish ophthalmologist)*

### Stevens-Johnson syndrome
A severe form of erythema multiforme (p562), and a variant of toxic epidermal necrolysis. It is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction, usually to drugs (eg salicylates, sulfonamides, penicillin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin), but is also seen with infections or cancer. There is ulceration of the skin and mucosal surfaces (see fig 15.18). Typical target lesions develop, often on the palms or soles with blistering in the centre. There may be a prodromal phase with fever, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia ± vomiting and diarrhoea. 
**Rx:** Mild disease is usually self-limiting—remove any precipitant and give supportive care (eg calamine lotion for the skin). Steroid use is controversial—trials have been variable, so ask a dermatologist and ophthalmologist. IV immunoglobulin has shown benefit. Plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive agents may have a role. 
**Prognosis:** Mortality ~5%. May be severe for the first 10d before resolving over 30d. Damage to the eyes may persist and blindness can result.

*Albert M Stevens 1884-1945; Frank C Johnson, 1894-1934 (US paediatricians)*

### Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)
**Essential features:** 1 Facial cutaneous capillary malformation (port wine stain; PWS) in the ophthalmic dermatome (V1 ± V2/V3). 2 Clinical signs or radiologic evidence of a leptomeningeal vascular malformation. 75% of patients with unilateral involvement develop seizures by age 1yr (95% if bilateral)—due (in part) to the increased metabolic demand of a developing brain in the setting of vascular compromise. Early management of seizures is critical to minimize brain injury. Some patients have severe cognitive and neurologic deficits beyond simple seizure activity. Screen early for glaucoma (50%). EEG and MRI help establish early diagnosis and treatment in patients at risk for SWS. Treat the PWS early with pulsed dye laser.

*William A Sturge, 1850-1919; Frederick P Weber, 1863-1962 (British physicians)*
