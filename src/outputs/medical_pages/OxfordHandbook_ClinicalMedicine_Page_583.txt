## Special circumstances for consent

Consent is complex, but remember that it exists for the benefit of the patient and the doctor, giving you an opportunity to revisit expectations and involve the patient in their own care. There are some areas of treatment or investigation for which it may be advisable to seek specialist advice if it is not part of your regular practice²:

- Photography of a patient.
- Innovative or novel treatment.
- Living organ donation.
- Storage, use, or removal of human tissue (for any length of time).
- The storage, loss, or use of gametes.
- The use of patient records or tissue in research or teaching.
- In the presence of an advanced directive or living will, expressly refusing a particular treatment, investigation, or action.
- Consent if <16yrs (consent form 3 in NHS). In the UK, those >16yrs can give valid consent. Those <16yrs can give consent for a medical decision provided they understand what it involves—the concept of Gillick competence. It is still good practice to involve the parents in the decision, if the child is willing. If <18yrs and refusing life-saving surgery, talk to the parents and your senior; the law is unclear. You may need to contact the duty judge in the High Court.
- Consent in the incapacitated (NHS consent form 4). No one (parents, relatives, or even members of a healthcare team) is able to give consent on behalf of an adult in England, and the High Court may be required to give a ruling on the matters of lawfulness of a proposed procedure. Proceeding in a patient's best interest is decided by the clinician overseeing their care, with involvement of family members or a nominated advocate.

## The right to refuse treatment

*Theirs not to make reply,*
*Theirs not to reason why,*
*Theirs but to do and die.* Alfred, Lord Tennyson from The Charge of the Light Brigade, 1854.

The rights of a patient are something of an antithesis to this military macabre of Tennyson, and it is our responsibility to respect the legal and ethical rights of those we treat. We do this not only for the sake of the individual, but also for the sake of an enduring trust between the patient and doctor, remembering that it is the patient's right to refuse treatment (if a fully competent adult) even when this may result in the death of the patient, or even the death of an unborn child, whatever the stage of pregnancy. The only exceptions apply to treatment of mental health disorders (see eg in England and Wales the Mental Health Act 2007).
