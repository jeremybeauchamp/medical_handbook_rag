# Opioids

The amount of opioid required to relieve pain varies and should be titrated on an individual basis. Oral morphine is 1st-line. If the oral route is unavailable, use morphine or diamorphine SC (see table 11.5, and tables 11.6, 11.7, p536). Explanation and regular review are important. Prescribe anti-emetics and laxatives for all patients.

**Start low, go slow:** For an opioid-naïve patient with moderate to severe pain, consider oral morphine 5mg every 4 hours plus 5mg PRN (maximum hourly). Consider a lower starting dose if elderly, ↓BMI, or renal impairment. If pain is not controlled, ↑ dose by 30-50% every 24h.

**Convert to modified release:** When pain is controlled, calculate the total daily dose including PRN and divide into two 12h doses of a modified-release preparation (eg MST Continus® 12h). Transdermal preparations are available: seek expert help for dose, check adhesion, and rotate site.

**Use a PRN dose for breakthrough pain:** 1/10th-1/6th of the total daily dose as an immediate-release preparation, eg Oramorph® or Sevredol®.

**Side-effects:** Drowsiness, nausea/vomiting (usually ↓ after 5 days), constipation, dry mouth. If difficulty tolerating morphine, or pain plus toxicity, consider an opioid switch (eg oxycodone) and ↓ dose by 25-30%.

**Toxicity:** Sedation, respiratory depression, visual hallucinations, myoclonic jerks, delirium. Be alert: recognizing toxicity early usually means naloxone is avoided. Monitor pulse oximetry, give oxygen if required. Consider ∆∆: intracranial bleed, renal failure. ↓Opioids and sedating drugs. Consider hydration. Seek expert help if remains opioid-toxic or in pain. ►Naloxone is only indicated for life-threatening respiratory depression (see p842). In patients on regular opiates it can precipitate a pain crisis and potentially fatal acute withdrawal.

**Renal failure:** Patients with renal impairment (eGFR <30) are at risk of toxicity due to accumulation of renally excreted opioids and metabolites. Monitor closely. Fentanyl, alfentanil, and buprenorphine have predominantly hepatic metabolism —seek expert advice.

**Concerns:** Patients may shrink from using opioids. Misconceptions are common: they are addictive, for the dying, if they use morphine now it will not work when they really need it. Respiratory depression is very rare when opioids are correctly titrated but opioids often get blamed when a patient deteriorates. Reassure patients that opioids are effective and safe when used appropriately.

**Morphine-resistant pain:** Seek expert help. Consider methadone, ketamine, and adjuvants such as NSAIDs, steroids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, nerve blocks. If neuropathic pain is suspected, try amitriptyline, pregabalin, or topical lidocaine. Consider the effect of psychological and spiritual well-being on pain (see p535).

**Rapid analgesia:** Most PRN medication takes time to have an effect. If this is a problem, seek expert help regarding rapid-release preparations (eg sublingual, intranasal, or buccal fentanyl). Try to pre-empt times of high pain (eg dressing changes) and give analgesia in advance.

**Table 11.5 Opioid dose equivalents:** conversions are not exact, potency can vary. If in doubt, use a dose below your estimate. Practice is variable: always defer to local guidelines first.
