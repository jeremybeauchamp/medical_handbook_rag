# 260 Constipation

Constipation reflects pelvic dysfunction or transit time. Accepted definitions and reported rates vary, but a place to start is the passage of ≤2 bowel motions/wk, often passed with difficulty, straining, or pain, and a sense of incomplete evacuation. ♀:♂≈2:1. Doctors' chief concerns are to find pointers to major pathology, eg constipation + rectal bleeding ≈ cancer; constipation + distension + active bowel sounds ≈ stricture/GI obstruction; constipation + menorrhagia ≈ hypothyroidism.

## The patient
Ask about frequency, nature, and consistency of stools. Is there blood or mucus in/on the stools? Is there diarrhoea alternating with constipation (eg IBS, p266)? Has there been recent change in bowel habit? Is she digitating the rectum or vagina to pass stool?¹⁵ Ask about diet and drugs. ▶PR examination is essential even when referring (refer if signs of colorectal ca, eg ↓weight, pain, or anaemia).

## Tests
None in young, mildly affected patients. Threshold for investigation diminishes with age; triggers include: ↓weight, abdominal mass, +PR blood, iron deficiency anaemia. Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca²⁺, TFT. Colonoscopy: If suspected colorectal malignancy. Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung's are occasionally needed.

## Treatment
Often reassurance, drinking more, and diet/exercise advice (p245) is all that is needed. Treat causes (BOX 'Causes of constipation'). A high-fibre diet is often advised, but may cause bloating without helping constipation. ▶Only use drugs if these measures fail, and try to use them for short periods only. Often, a stimulant such as senna ± a bulking agent is more effective and cheaper than agents such as lactulose. Bulking agents: ↑Faecal mass, so stimulating peristalsis. They must be taken with plenty of fluid and may take a few days to act. CI: difficulty in swallowing; GI obstruction; colonic atony; faecal impaction. Bran powder 3.5g 2-3 times/d with food (may hinder absorption of dietary trace elements if taken with every meal). Ispaghula husk, eg 1 Fybogel® sachet after a meal, mixed in water and swallowed promptly (or else it becomes an unpleasant sludge). Methylcellulose, eg Celevac® 3-6 tablets/12h with ≥300mL water. Sterculia, eg Normacol® granules, 10mL sprinkled on food daily. Stimulant laxatives: Increase intestinal motility, so do not use in intestinal obstruction or acute colitis. Avoid prolonged use as it may cause colonic atony. Abdominal cramps are an important SE. Pure stimulant laxatives are bisacodyl tablets (5-10mg at night) or suppositories (10mg in the mornings) and senna (2-4 tablets at night). Docusate sodium and dantron¹⁶ have stimulant and softening actions. Glycerol suppositories act as a rectal stimulant. Sodium picosulfate (5-10mg at night) is a potent stimulant. Stool softeners: Particularly useful when managing painful anal conditions, eg fissure. Arachis oil enemas lubricate and soften impacted faeces. Liquid paraffin should not be used for a prolonged period (SE: anal seepage, lipoid pneumonia, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins). Osmotic laxatives: Retain fluid in the bowel. Lactulose, a semisynthetic disaccharide, produces osmotic diarrhoea of low faecal pH that discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms. It is useful in hepatic encephalopathy (initial dose: 30-50mL/12h). SE: bloating, so its role in treating constipation is limited. Macrogol (eg Movicol®) is another example. Magnesium salts (eg magnesium hydroxide; magnesium sulfate) are useful when rapid bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts (eg Microlette® and Micralax® enemas) should be avoided as they may cause sodium and water retention. Phosphate enemas are useful for rapid bowel evacuation prior to procedures.

## If these don't help
Prucalopride is an elective 5HT₄ agonist with prokinetic properties; Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal fluid secretion; Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that also increases fluid secretion and decreases visceral pain. A multidisciplinary approach with behaviour therapy, habit training ± sphincter biofeedback may help.
