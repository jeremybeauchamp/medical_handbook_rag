# 400 Complications of HIV infection

Complications of HIV can be divided into:
• complications of immune dysfunction (opportunistic infection/malignancy)
• complicating comorbidity
• complications of treatment, ie adverse drug effects (see pp402-3).

The differential diagnosis for symptoms presenting in a person with HIV is given in table 9.11. This is not exhaustive. Do not forget your usual differentials, the presentation may not relate to the patient's HIV status.

## Opportunistic disease

ART is part of the treatment regimen of all opportunistic infections (see pp402-3).

• **Pneumocystis jirovecii**: ('yee-row-vet-zee') Presentation: progressive SOB on exertion, malaise, dry cough. Haemoptysis and pleuritic pain rare. Examination: respiratory rate, often normal breath sounds. Investigation: SpO2 (compare rest and exertion). CXR: classically perihilar infiltrates (fig 9.12), but may be normal. Induced sputum or BAL with staining or nucleic acid amplification. Treatment: IV co-trimoxazole (convert to oral if favourable response). 21-day course. Steroids in moderate-severe disease (PaO2 <9.3KPa/SpO2 <92%). 2nd-line: clindamycin, pentamidine, atovaquone. Prophylaxis: co-trimoxazole if CD4 <200 cells/microlitre.

• **Candidiasis**: Oral or oesophageal. Pain in the tongue, dysphagia, odynophagia. Diagnosed clinically or endoscopically. Treated with systemic '-azole', eg fluconazole.

• **Cryptococcus neoformans**: Commonest systemic fungal infection in HIV (5-10% pre-ART). Presentation: meningitis: headache, fever, meningism variable. May be associated skin (molluscum-like papules) and lung disease. Investigation: LP with manometry, CSF stain (India ink), CSF/blood cryptococcal antigen. Treatment: induction with liposomal amphotericin B (SE: renal tubular damage and AKI). Addition of flucytosine has shown benefit in patients not on ART (SE: haematological toxicity). Maintenance treatment with fluconazole. Normalize ICP with repeat LPs/shunt.

• **Toxoplasma gondii**: Toxoplasma abscesses are commonest cause of intracranial mass lesions when CD4 <200 cells/microlitre. Presentation: focal neurological signs ± seizures. Headache and vomiting if raised ICP. Investigation: ring-enhancing lesions on MRI (∆∆ lymphoma) with associated oedema. CSF PCR for T. gondii is specific but only moderately sensitive. Blood serology is not diagnostic as most cases are a reactivation of previous infection. Treatment: consider in any brain mass lesion with CD4 <200 cell/microlitre. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid.

• **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)**: Severe primary or reactivated disease (see p405). Presentation: retinitis (blurred then loss of vision), encephalitis, GI disease (oesophagitis, colitis), hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, pneumonia. Diagnosis: serial CMV viral load, retinal lesions (p438), GI ulceration, 'owl's eye' inclusions on biopsy. Treatment: ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Side-effects: rash, diarrhoea, bone myelosuppression.

• **Cryptosporidium**: Common cause of chronic diarrhoea in HIV pre-ART. Presentation: acute or sub-acute non-bloody, watery diarrhoea. Also cholangitis, pancreatitis. Investigation: stool microscopy (multiple samples as oocyst excretion intermittent), PCR, enzyme immunoassay, direct fluorescent antibody. Treatment: supportive, ART.

• **Kaposi's sarcoma**: Most common tumour in HIV and AIDS defining. Caused by Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (human herpesvirus 8, p405). Presentation: cutaneous or mucosal lesions: patch, plaque, or nodular. Visceral disease less common. Investigation: histological confirmation. Treatment: ART. Intralesional retinoids or vinblastine. Radiotherapy for cosmesis/pain. Chemotherapy (+ART) in advanced disease.

• **Lymphoma**: Increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in HIV. Includes: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma. Presentation: dependent upon area of involvement. Includes lymphadenopathy, cytopenia, CNS symptoms. Treatment: combined ART and chemotherapy. Rituximab for non-CNS disease. Whole-brain radiotherapy for CNS disease if excess toxicity with chemotherapy.
