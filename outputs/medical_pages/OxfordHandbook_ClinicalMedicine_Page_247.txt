An artistic representation inspired by Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, showing multiple human figures in a swirling, dynamic composition. In the lower left corner, there's a small diagram of a human brain with labeled parts.

**Fig 5.22 Neuroendocrinology: emotions → thoughts → actions.** As Michelangelo foretold (in his *Creation of Adam*) 'all gods and demons that have ever existed are within us as possibilities, desires, and ways of escape'. Within the dark red vault of our skull we see human and god-like forms reaching out, as thoughts escape into actions—with legs extending into our brainstem (B) and a fist is pushing from our hypothalamus into the pituitary stalk (P). Above the pituitary we have thoughts, ideas, impulses, and neurotransmitters. Below we have hormones. Between is the realm of neuroendocrinology—the neurosecretory cells which turn emotions into the releasing factors for the pituitary hormones (fig 5.4).
