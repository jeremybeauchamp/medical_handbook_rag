## Complications

- Post-dural puncture headache. • Infection. • Bleeding. • Cerebral herniation
(rare, check for signs of ICP before proceeding). • Minor/transient neurological
symptoms, eg paraesthesia, radiculopathy.

Any change in lower body neurology after an LP (pain, weakness, sensory changes,
bladder/bowel disturbance) should be treated as cauda equina compression (hae-
matoma/abscess) until proven otherwise. Obtain an urgent MRI spine.

Post-LP brain MRI scans often show diffuse meningeal enhancement with gado-
linium. This is thought to be a reflection of increased blood flow secondary to
intracranial hypotension. Interpret these scans with caution and in the context of
the patient's clinical situation. Ensure the reason for the scan and current neuro-
logical examination are discussed with the radiologist pre procedure.

## Post-LP headache

**Risk** 10-30%, typically occurring within 24h of LP, resolution over hours to 2wks
(mean: 3-4d). Patients describe a constant, dull ache, more frontal than occipi-
tal. The most characteristic symptom is of positional exacerbation—worse when
upright. There may be mild meningism or nausea. The pathology is thought to
be continued leakage of CSF from the puncture site and intracranial hypotension,
though there may be other mechanisms involved.

**Prevention** Use the smallest spinal needle that is practical (22G) and keep the
bevel aligned as described on p768. Blunt needles (more expensive) can reduce risk
and are recommended (ask an anaesthetist about supply); however, collection of
CSF takes too long (>6min) if needles smaller than 22G are used. Before withdraw-
ing the needle, reinsert the stilette.

**Treatment** Despite years of anecdotal advice to the contrary, none of the follow-
ing has ever been shown to be a risk factor: position during or after the procedure;
hydration status before, during, or after; amount of CSF removed; immediate activ-
ity or rest post-LP. Time is a consistent healer. For severe or prolonged headaches,
ask an anaesthetist about a blood patch. This is a careful injection of 20mL of
autologous venous blood into the adjacent epidural space (said to 'clog up the
hole'). Immediate relief occurs in 95%.
