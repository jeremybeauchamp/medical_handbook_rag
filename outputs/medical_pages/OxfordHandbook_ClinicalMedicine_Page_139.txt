# Continuous ECG monitoring

A simple 12-lead ECG only gives a snapshot of the heart's electrical activities. Many disorders, particularly the arrhythmias, come and go and so may be missed at the time of the ECG recording. If you feel you are missing a paroxysmal arrhythmia, there are many ways of recording the electrical activity over a longer period:

**Telemetry:** An inpatient wears ECG leads and the signals are shown on screens being watched by staff. Thus, if a dangerous arrhythmia occurs, help is immediately available. This is very resource intensive so reserved for those at high risk of dangerous arrhythmias, eg immediately post-STEMI.

**Exercise ECGs:** The patient exercises according to a standardized protocol (eg Bruce on a treadmill) and the BP and ECG are monitored, looking for ischaemic changes, arrhythmias, and features suggestive of arrhythmia risk, such as delta waves.

**Holter monitors:** The patient wears an ECG monitor which records their rhythm for 24h-7d whilst they go about their normal life, this is later analysed. These can also be used to pick up ST changes suggestive of ischaemia.

**Loop recorders:** These record only when activated by the patient— they cleverly save a small amount of ECG data before the event—useful if the arrhythmia causes loss of consciousness: the patient can press the button when they wake up. Loop recorders may be implanted just under the skin (eg Reveal® or the newer, injectable LINQ device), and are especially useful in patients with infrequent episodes as they can continually monitor for months or years awaiting an event (Fig 3.25).

**Pacemakers and ICDs:** These record details of cardiac electrical activity and device activity. This information can be useful for establishing an arrhythmic origin for symptoms.

Fig 3.25 This is a recording from a loop recorder, each line follows on from the one above. This tracing was recorded at the time of a syncopal episode, it shows cardiac slowing then a 15sec pause: quite long enough to cause syncope! But not long enough to arrange a standard ECG, even if the patient were in hospital.

# Sick sinus syndrome

Sick sinus syndrome is usually caused by sinus node fibrosis, typically in elderly patients. The sinus node becomes dysfunctional, in some cases slowing to the point of sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses, in others generating tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia.

**Symptoms:** Syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations, breathlessness.

**Management:**
- Thromboembolism prophylaxis if episodes of AF are detected.
- Permanent pacemakers for patients with symptomatic bradycardia or sinus pauses.

Some patients develop a 'tachy brady syndrome', suffering from alternating tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms. This can prove difficult to treat medically as treating one circumstance (eg tachycardia) increases the risk from the other. Pacing for bradycardic episodes in combination with rate-slowing medications for tachycardic episodes may be required if the patient is symptomatic or unstable.
