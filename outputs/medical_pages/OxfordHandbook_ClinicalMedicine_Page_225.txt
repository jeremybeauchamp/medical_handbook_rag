# Controlling blood pressure in diabetes

## Type 1 DM:
Treat BP if >135/85mmHg, unless albuminuria or two or more features of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130/80mmHg (NICE 2015). Use an ACE-i 1st line or angiotensin receptor antagonist if intolerant. If hypertensive and underlying renal involvement, see local guidance, p304.

## Type 2 DM:
Target BP <140/80mmHg or <130/80mmHg if kidney, eye, or cerebrovascular damage. 1st-line drug treatment should be an ACE-i, except in those of African or Caribbean origin, where ACE-i plus diuretic or a calcium-channel antagonist (CCA) should be started. For pregnant women offer CCA. Do not offer aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease to adults with type 1 DM (NICE 2015). Don't combine an ACE-i with an angiotensin receptor antagonist.

## Improving quality of life: going beyond the pleasures of the flesh

'I cannot eat what I want because of your pitiful diet. Sex is out because diabetes has made me impotent. Smoking is banned, so what's left? I'd shoot myself if only I could see straight.' Start by acknowledging your patient's distress. Don't shrug it off—but don't take it at face value either. Life may be transformed by cataract surgery, sildenafil (unless contraindicated, p230), dietary negotiation, and sport (it needn't be shooting). Take steps to simplify care. Stop blood glucose self-monitoring if it's achieving nothing (known to ↓ quality of life). Even if all these interventions fail, you have one trump card up your sleeve: 'Let's both try to find one new thing of value before we next meet—and compare notes'. This opens the way to vicarious pleasure: a whole new world.
