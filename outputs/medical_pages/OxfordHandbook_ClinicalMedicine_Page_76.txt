## The gastrointestinal system: examination

### Inspection
Does your patient appear comfortable or in distress? Look for abnormal contours/distension. Tattoos? Cushingoid appearance may suggest steroid use post-transplant or IBD. Inspect (and smell) for signs of chronic liver disease:

- Hepatic fetor on breath (p274).
- Purpura (purple-stained skin, p344).
- Spider naevi (fig 2.27, p60).
- Asterixis.
- Gynaecomastia.
- Scratch marks.
- Palmar erythema.
- Clubbing (rare).
- Muscle wasting.
- Jaundice.

Look for signs of malignancy (cachexia, masses), anaemia, jaundice, Virchow's node.
From the end of the bed inspect the abdomen for:

- Visible pulsation (aneurysm, p654).
- Striae (stretch marks, eg pregnancy).
- Peristalsis.
- Distension.
- Scars.
- Genitalia.
- Masses.
- Herniae.

If abdominal wall veins look dilated, assess direction of flow. In inferior vena caval (IVC) obstruction, below the umbilicus blood flows up; in portal hypertension (caput medusae), flow radiates out from the umbilicus.

The cough test: While looking at the face, ask the patient to cough. If this causes abdominal pain, flinching, or a protective movement of hands towards the abdomen, suspect peritonitis.

### Hands
Clubbing, leuconychia (whitening of the nails due to hypoalbuminaemia), koilonychia ('spooning' of the nails due to iron, B12, or folate deficiency), Muehrcke's lines (transverse white lines due to hypoalbuminaemia), blue lunulae (bluish discolouration seen in Wilson's disease). Palmar erythema (chronic liver disease, pregnancy), Dupuytren's contracture (thickening and fibrous contraction of palmar fascia (see fig 2.26, p60; alcoholic liver disease)). Hepatic flap/asterixis (hepatic encephalopathy, uraemia from renal disease), check pulse and respiratory rate (infection/sepsis?), palpate for AV fistulae in the forearm (haemodialysis access in renal failure).

### Face
Assess for jaundice, anaemia, xanthelasma (PBC, chronic obstruction), Kayser-Fleischer rings (green-yellow ring at corneal margin seen in Wilson's disease). Inspect mouth for angular stomatitis (thiamine, B12, iron deficiency), pigmentation (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, p709, fig 15.14), telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome/hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, p709, fig 15.12), ulcers (IBD), glossitis (iron, B12, or folate deficiency).

### Cervical lymph nodes
Palpate for enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node/Troisier's sign) (gastric carcinoma?).

### Abdomen
Inspect: Look around to the flanks for nephrectomy scars.

Palpate: Note any masses, tenderness, guarding (involuntary tensing of abdominal muscles—pain or fear of it), or rebound tenderness (greater pain on removing hand than on gently depressing abdomen—peritoneal inflammation); Rovsing's sign (appendicitis, p608); Murphy's sign (cholecystitis, p634). Palpating the liver: Assess size (see BOX 'Causes of hepatomegaly'), regularity, smoothness, and tenderness. Pulsatile (tricuspid regurgitation)? The scratch test is another way to find the lower liver edge (if it is below the costal margin): start with diaphragm of stethoscope at right costal margin. Gently scratch the abdominal wall, starting in the right lower quadrant, working towards the liver edge. A sharp increase in transmission of the scratch is heard when the border of the liver is reached. Palpating the spleen: If suspect splenomegaly but cannot detect it, assess patient in the right lateral position with your left hand pulling forwards from behind the rib cage. Palpating the kidneys: See fig 2.30, p61. May be non palpable unless slim. Enlarged? Nodular? Palpating the aorta: Normally palpable transmitted pulsation in thin individuals.
