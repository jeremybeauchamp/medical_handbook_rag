Table 12.4 Criteria for diagnosing RA22

When to suspect RA? Those with ≥1 swollen joint and a suggestive clinical history, which is not better explained by another disease. Scores ≥6 are diagnostic.

| A | Joint involvement (swelling or tenderness ± imaging evidence) |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 large joint =0 | 2-10 large joints =1 | 1-3 small* joints† =2 |
| 4-10 small* joints† =3 | > 10 joints (at least 1 small joint) =5 |

| B | Serology (at least 1 test result needed) |
|---|------------------------------------------|
| Negative RF and negative anti-CCP =0 | Low +ve RF or low +ve anti-CCP =2 |
| High +ve RF or high +ve anti-CCP =3 |

| C | Acute phase reactants (at least 1 test result needed) |
|---|------------------------------------------------------|
| Normal CRP and normal ESR =0 | Abnormal CRP or abnormal ESR =1 |

| D | Duration of symptoms: <6 weeks =0 ≥6 weeks =1 |
|---|----------------------------------------------|

*= MCPJ, PIPJ, 2nd-5th MTPJ, wrists, and thumb IPJ; †= with or without involvement of large joints.

## Quality of life

Depression, disability, and pain are important quality of life predictors. Be mindful of the impact of disease on relationships, work, and hobbies and acknowledge and explore this with your patients. Patients may wish to investigate complementary therapies and may find benefit from support groups.

## Influencing biological events in RA

The chief biological event is inflammation. Over-produced cytokines and cellular processes erode cartilage and bone, and produce the systemic effects seen in RA. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are 1st line and should ideally be started within 3 months of persistent symptoms. They can take 6-12 weeks for symptomatic benefit. Best results are often achieved with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.23 Leflunomide is another option.

Immunosuppression is a potentially fatal SE of treatment (especially in combination with methotrexate) which can result in pancytopenia, susceptibility to infection (including atypical organisms), and neutropenic sepsis (p352). Regular FBC, LFT monitoring.24

Other SE:
- Methotrexate—pneumonitis (pre treatment CXR), oral ulcers, hepatotoxicity, teratogenic.
- Sulfasalazine—rash, ↓sperm count, oral ulcers, GI upset.
- Leflunomide—teratogenicity (♂ and ♀), oral ulcers, ↑BP, hepatotoxicity.
- Hydroxychloroquine—can cause retinopathy; pre treatment and annual eye screen required.

### Biological agents and NICE guidance
Initiated by specialists, for patients with active disease despite adequate trial of at least 2 DMARDs. Pre treatment screening for TB, hepatitis B/C, HIV essential.

1. TNFα inhibitors: Eg infliximab (p265), etanercept, adalimumab, are approved by NICE as 1st-line agents. Where methotrexate is contraindicated, can be used as monotherapy. Clinical response can be striking, with improved function and health outcomes, although response may be inadequate/unsustained.25

2. B-cell depletion: Eg rituximab, used in combination with methotrexate and approved by NICE for severe active RA where DMARDs and a TNFα blocker have failed.26

3. IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition: Eg tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker), approved by NICE in combination with methotrexate where TNFα blocker has failed (or is contraindicated).27 Monitor for hypercholesterolaemia.

4. Inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation: Eg abatacept—licensed for active RA where patients have not responded to DMARDs or TNFα blocker.28

Side effects of biological agents: Serious infection, reactivation of TB (∴ screen and consider prophylaxis) and hepatitis B; worsening heart failure; hypersensitivity; injection-site reactions and blood disorders. ANA and reversible SLE-type illness may evolve. Data suggests there is no increased risk of solid organ tumours but skin cancers may be more common.29 TNF inhibitors do not appear to be associated with a further increase in the already elevated lymphoma occurrence in RA.30
