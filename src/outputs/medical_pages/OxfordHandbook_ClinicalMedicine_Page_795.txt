The image shows a mostly blank page with the following elements:

1. The number "781" in the top right corner.

2. A vertical red bar on the right side of the page containing the word "Emergencies" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. A small red triangle with an exclamation mark inside it at the bottom right corner of the page.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter heading page for an "Emergencies" section in a larger document or manual, likely related to safety procedures or emergency protocols.
