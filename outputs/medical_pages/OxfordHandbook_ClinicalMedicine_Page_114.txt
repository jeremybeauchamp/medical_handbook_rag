# ECG—additional points

## Where to place the chest leads (See fig 3.6.)

| Lead | Placement |
|------|-----------|
| V1   | Right sternal edge, 4th intercostal space. |
| V2   | Left sternal edge, 4th intercostal space. |
| V3   | Half-way between V2 and V4. |
| V4   | 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line; all subsequent leads are in the same horizontal plane as V4. |
| V5   | Anterior axillary line. |
| V6   | Mid-axillary line (V7: posterior axillary line). |

Good skin preparation (clean with non-alcoholic wipe, shave if hairy, etc.) will improve ECG quality. Finish 12-lead ECGs with a long rhythm strip in lead II.

## QRS complexes: the long and the short

QRS complexes represent ventricular depolarization, and width represents time, so a broader QRS complex means depolarization of the ventricles is taking longer. Normally, a wave of depolarization reaches the ventricles via the specialist conduction pathways—the bundles of His. This delivers the electrical activity to certain points of the ventricles, meaning the waves of depolarization need travel as short a distance as possible to depolarize all the ventricular myocardium. This allows rapid spread of depolarization and thus an efficient contraction action as both ventricles contract from apex to outflow tracts together. Hence, the QRS complex is narrow (<120ms).

Ventricular depolarization takes longer when depolarization is not initiated in this pattern. For example, if it originates in the ventricles (eg ventricular ectopics, VT) or if one or more branches of the bundles of His are blocked—bundle branch blocks —meaning depolarization is initiated in one ventricle but not the other, so it has to travel the long (in time and space) path from one ventricle to the other.

Ventricular depolarization also takes longer if all conduction is slowed. This may happen in some electrolyte imbalances, eg hyperkalaemia.

### Right bundle branch block: 
(p102, fig 3.8) QRS >0.12s, 'RSR' pattern in V1; dominant R in V1; inverted T waves in V1–V3 or V4; wide, slurred S wave in V6. Causes: normal variant (isolated RBBB), pulmonary embolism, cor pulmonale.

### Left bundle branch block: 
(p101, fig 3.7) QRS >0.12s, 'M' pattern in V5, dominant S in V1, inverted T waves in I, aVL, V5–V6. Causes: IHD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, idiopathic fibrosis. NB: if there is LBBB, no comment can be made on the ST segment or T wave. New LBBB may represent a STEMI, see p798.

### Bifascicular block: 
The combination of RBBB and left bundle hemiblock, manifest as an axis deviation, eg left axis deviation in the case of left anterior hemiblock.

### Trifascicular block: 
Bifascicular block plus 1st-degree HB. May need pacing (p132).

Suspect left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if the R wave in V6 is >25mm or the sum of the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V6 is >35mm (see fig 3.41).

Suspect right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) if dominant R wave in V1, T wave inversion in V1–V3 or V4, deep S wave in V6, right axis deviation.

Other causes of dominant R wave in V1: RBBB, posterior MI, type A WPW syndrome (p133).

### Causes of low-voltage QRS complex: 
(QRS <5mm in all limb leads.) Hypothyroidism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), haematocrit (intracardiac blood resistivity is related to haematocrit), changes in chest wall impedance (eg in renal failure & subcutaneous emphysema but not obesity), pulmonary embolism, bundle branch block, carcinoid heart disease, myocarditis, cardiac amyloid, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and other heart muscle diseases, pericardial effusion, pericarditis.
