# Features of skin ulceration to note on examination

## Site
Above the medial malleolus ('gaiter' area) is the favourite place for venous ulcers (fig 13.56; mostly related to superficial venous disease, but may reflect venous hypertension via damage to the valves of the deep venous system, eg 2° to DVT). Venous hypertension leads to the development of superficial varicosities and skin changes (lipodermatosclerosis = induration, pigmentation, and inflammation of the skin). Minimal trauma to the leg leads to ulceration which often takes many months to heal. Ulcers on the sacrum, greater trochanter, or heel suggest pressure sores (OHCS p604), particularly if the patient is bed-bound with suboptimal nutrition.

## Temperature
The ulcer and surrounding tissues are cold in an ischaemic ulcer. If the skin is warm and well perfused then local factors are more likely.

## Surface area
Draw a map of the area to quantify and time any healing (a wound >4wks old is a chronic ulcer as distinguished from an acute wound).

## Shape
Oval, circular (cigarette burns), serpiginous (Klebsiella granulomatis, p412); unusual morphology can be secondary to mycobacterial infection, eg cutaneous tuberculosis or scrofuloderma (tuberculosis colliquativa cutis, where an infected lymph node ulcerates through to the skin).

## Edge
Shelved/sloping ≈ healing; punched-out ≈ ischaemic or syphilis; rolled/everted ≈ malignant; undermined ≈ TB.

## Base
Any muscle, bone, or tendon destruction (malignancy; pressure sores; ischaemia)? There may be a grey-yellow slough, beneath which is a pale pink base. Slough is a mixture of fibrin, cell breakdown products, serous exudate, leucocytes, and bacteria—it need not imply infection, and can be part of the normal wound healing process. Granulation tissue is a deep pink gel-like matrix contained within a fibrous collagen network and is evidence of a healing wound.

## Depth
If not uncomfortable for the patient (eg in neuropathic ulceration), a probe can be used to gauge how deep the ulceration extends.

## Discharge
Culture before starting any antibiotics (which usually don't work). A watery discharge is said to favour TB; bleeding can ≈ malignancy.

## Associated lymphadenopathy
Suggests infection or malignancy.

## Sensation
Decreased sensation around the ulcer implies neuropathy.

## Position in phases of extension/healing
Healing is heralded by granulation, scar formation, and epithelialization. Inflamed margins ≈ extension.

The image shows a venous ulcer in the gaiter area of a leg. The ulcer appears as a large, irregular-shaped lesion with a reddish-brown appearance. The surrounding skin shows signs of discoloration and swelling, consistent with venous disease. The leg is positioned on a blue medical drape.
