## On being busy: Corrigan's secret door

Dr Corrigan of Dublin was:
> 'tall, erect, of commanding figure...He had the countenance of an intellectual... and his face "beamed with kindness"...In temperament his distinguishing traits were kindness and tenderness towards the sick, and the ability to make a bold decision.'

Was he busy? At the start of his professional life he was advised that the best way to get business was to pretend to have it. It was suggested that a note marked 'Immediate and pressing' should be ostentatiously handed to him at the dinner table, but always at a suitable time so as not to miss the best food. Such advice was not taken. Corrigan aspired to hard work and taught his students the value of 'never doing nothing'. The city in which he practised had a 'degree of filth, stench and darkness, inconceivable by those who have not experienced them', and 'not enough hospital beds to care for the great numbers in need.' And so the story of a secret door, made in his consulting room, to escape the ever growing queue of eager patients.

In times of chaos, filled with competing, urgent, simultaneous demands, excessive paperwork, too few beds, effort-reward imbalance, personal sacrifice, and despair; we all need Corrigan to take us by the shadow of our hand, and walk with us through a secret door into a calm inner world. Our metaphorical door has five parts:

1. However lonely you feel, you are not usually alone. Do not pride yourself on not asking for help. If a decision is a hard one, share it with a colleague.

2. Take any chance you get to sit down and rest. Have a cup of tea with other members of staff, or with a friendly patient (patients are sources of renewal, not just devourers of your energies).

3. Do not miss meals. If there is no time to go to the canteen, ensure that food is put aside for you to eat when you can: hard work and sleeplessness are twice as bad when you are hungry.

4. Avoid making work for yourself. It is too easy for doctors, trapped in their image of excessive work, and blackmailed by misplaced guilt, to remain on the wards re-clerking patients, re-writing notes, or re-checking results at an hour when the priority should be caring for themselves.

5. Look to the future. Plan for a good time after a bad rota.

The origins of the story of Corrigan's secret door are unknown. It may never have existed other than in these hallowed pages. But when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.^7

### Resilience and coping

'Burnout' is common in clinical medicine. It is a syndrome of lost enthusiasm, reduced empathy, increased cynicism, and a decrease in the meaningfulness of work. Coping styles and resilience can protect doctors and better equip them to meet, and learn from, the challenges of clinical practice:^12

- Self-directedness correlates strongly with resilience. A personal sense of responsibility allows learning from mistakes and moving on.
- Cooperativeness is the ability to work with opinions and behaviours different to your own, preventing them becoming a source of stress.
- Clinicians who are low in harm avoidance are better able to accept uncertainty and a degree of risk. This facilitates decision-making as it is unclouded by anxiety and pessimism about potential problems. Supervised experience outside your comfort zone may help you deal better with uncertainty.
- Be persistent but set realistic goals. Perfectionism can be detrimental.
- Task-orientated coping occurs when a situation is seen as changeable. This is associated with less burnout than emotion-orientated coping when situations are considered unchangeable: don't just do something, stand there.
- Be self-aware. Development or modification of your personality traits may reduce your vulnerability.
