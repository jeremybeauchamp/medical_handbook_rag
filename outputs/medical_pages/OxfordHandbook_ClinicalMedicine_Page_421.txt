# Immunization

*Passive immunity* uses pre-formed antibody to protect against infection. It offers immediate but short-lived protection. Natural passive immunity occurs in the placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus; acquired passive immunity includes treatment with immunoglobulin eg hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, varicella-zoster.

*Active immunity* follows exposure to an antigen, which generates an adaptive immune response. Natural active immunity occurs following infection. Acquired active immunity is provided by vaccination. Routine vaccinations in the UK are shown in table 9.13. Additional vaccines are offered to specific vulnerable groups (table 9.14).

*Immunosuppression* is a contraindication to live vaccines due to the risk of disseminated disease. Includes immunodeficiency, immunosuppressive treatment, HIV. Inactivated vaccines can be given but the antibody response may be less: aim to give >2wks prior to immunosuppressive therapy when possible (or vaccinate whilst on treatment and considered repeat re-immunization when/if treatment complete).

## Travel

Travel advice (food/drink, insect repellent, malaria prophylaxis, condoms) is more important than vaccination. Check routine vaccinations are up to date. Vaccination depends upon area of travel and planned activities: BCG (live), rabies, yellow fever (live), hepatitis A/B, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, typhoid.
