# The jugular venous pressure (JVP)

The internal jugular vein acts as a capricious manometer of right atrial pressure. Observe the height and the waveform of the pulse. JVP observations are often difficult, so do not be downhearted if the skill seems to elude you. Examine necks, and the patterns you see may slowly start to make sense—see fig 2.11 for the local venous anatomy. Concomitantly palpate the arterial pulse to help decipher patterns.

## The height

Observe the patient at 45°, with their head turned slightly to the left and neck relaxed. Good lighting and correct positioning are key. Look for the right internal jugular vein as it passes just medial to the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid up behind the angle of the jaw to the earlobes. The JVP is assessed by measuring the vertical height from the manubriosternal angle (not the sternal notch) to the top of the pulse. Pressure at zero (at the sternal angle) is 5cm, so add the height of the JVP with 5cm to obtain the right heart filling pressure in cm of water. A pressure above 9cm (4cm above the sternal angle at 45°) is elevated.

## Is the pulse venous (and not arterial)?

- Usually impalpable, and obliterated by finger pressure on the vessel.
- Rises transiently with pressure on abdomen (abdominojugular reflux)² or on liver (hepatojugular reflux), and alters with posture and respiration (disappears when patient sits from lying flat).
- Usually has a double pulse for every arterial pulse. See fig 2.12.

## Abnormalities of the JVP

- Raised JVP with normal waveform: Fluid overload, right heart failure.
- Fixed raised JVP with absent pulsation: SVC obstruction (p528).
- Large a wave: Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis.
- Cannon a wave: When the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve, large 'cannon' a waves result. Causes—complete heart block, single chamber ventricular pacing, ventricular arrhythmias/ectopics.
- Absent a wave: Atrial fibrillation.
- Large v waves: Tricuspid regurgitation—look for earlobe movement.
- Constrictive pericarditis: High plateau of JVP (which rises on inspiration—Kussmaul's sign) with deep x and y descents.
- Absent JVP: When lying flat, the jugular vein should be filled. If there is reduced circulatory volume (eg dehydration, haemorrhage) the JVP may be absent.

| Fig 2.12 The jugular venous pressure wave |
|------------------------------------------|
| a wave: atrial systole                    |
| c wave: closure of tricuspid valve, not normally visible |
| x descent: fall in atrial pressure during ventricular systole |
| v wave: atrial filling against a closed tricuspid valve |
| y descent: opening of tricuspid valve     |

The JVP drops as the x descent during ventricular systole because the right atrium is no longer contracting. This means that the pressure in the right atrium is dropping and this is reflected by the JVP.
