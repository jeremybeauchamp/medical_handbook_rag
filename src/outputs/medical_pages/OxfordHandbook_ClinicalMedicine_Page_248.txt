# Pituitary tumours

Pituitary tumours (almost always benign adenomas) account for 10% of intracranial tumours (see figs 5.23, 5.24). They may be divided by size: a microadenoma is a tumour <1cm across, and a macroadenoma is >1cm. There are three histological types (table 5.4):

1. **Chromophobe** 70%. Many are non-secretory;10 some cause hypopituitarism. Half produce prolactin (PRL); a few produce ACTH or GH. Local pressure effect in 30%.
2. **Acidophil** 15%. Secrete GH or PRL. Local pressure effect in 10%.
3. **Basophil** 15%. Secrete ACTH. Local pressure effect rare.

Symptoms are caused by pressure, hormones (eg galactorrhoea), or hypopituitarism (p232). FSH-secreting tumours can cause macro-orchidism in men, but are rare.

## Features of local pressure
Headache, visual field defects (bilateral temporal hemianopia, due to compression of the optic chiasm), palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, VI (pressure or invasion of the cavernous sinus; fig 5.25). Also, diabetes insipidus (DI) (p240; more likely from hypothalamic disease); disturbance of hypothalamic centres of T°, sleep, and appetite; erosion through floor of sella leading to CSF rhinorrhoea.

## Tests
MRI defines intra- and supra-sellar extension; accurate assessment of visual fields; screening tests: PRL, IGF-1 (p238), ACTH, cortisol, TFTs, LH/FSH, testosterone in ♂, short Synacthen® test. Glucose tolerance test if acromegaly suspected (p238). If Cushing's suspected, see p225. Water deprivation test if DI is suspected (p240).

## Treatment
Start hormone replacement as needed (p232). Ensure steroids are given before levothyroxine, as thyroxine may precipitate an adrenal crisis. For Cushing's disease see p225, prolactinoma p236, acromegaly p238.

- **Surgery**: (fig 5.26) Most pituitary surgery is trans-sphenoidal, but if there is supra-sellar extension, a trans-frontal approach may be used. For prolactinoma, 1st-line treatment is medical with a dopamine agonist, p236. Pre-op: ensure hydrocortisone 100mg IV/IM. Subsequent cortisol replacement and reassessment varies with local protocols: get advice. Post-op: retest pituitary function (p232) to assess replacement needs. Repeating dynamic tests for adrenal function ≥6 weeks post-op.
- **Radiotherapy**: (Eg stereotactic.) Good for residual or recurrent adenomas (good rates of tumour control and normalization of excess hormone secretion).27

## Post-op
Recurrence may occur late after surgery, so life-long follow-up is required. Fertility should be discussed: this may be reduced post-op due to gonadotropins.

## Pituitary apoplexy
Rapid pituitary enlargement from a bleed into a tumour may cause mass effects, cardiovascular collapse due to acute hypopituitarism, and death. Suspect if acute onset of headache, meningism, ↓GCS, ophthalmoplegia/visual field defect, especially if there is a known tumour (may present like subarachnoid haemorrhage). ℞: Urgent steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg IV) and meticulous fluid balance ± cabergoline (dopamine agonist, if prolactinoma) ± surgery; find the cause, eg a predisposition to thrombosis, from antiphospholipid syndrome.

## Craniopharyngioma
Not strictly a pituitary tumour: it originates from Rathke's pouch so is situated between the pituitary and 3rd ventricle floor. They are rare, but are the commonest childhood intracranial tumour. Over 50% present in childhood with growth failure; adults may present with amenorrhoea, ↓libido, hypothalamic symptoms (eg DI, hyperphagia, sleep disturbance) or tumour mass effect. Tests: CT/MRI (calcification in 50%, may also be seen on skull x-ray). Treatment: Surgery ± post-op radiation; test pituitary function post-op.

## Table 5.4 Frequency of hormones secreted by pituitary adenomas based on immunohistochemistry

| Hormone | % | Hormone | % |
|---------|---|---------|---|
| PRL only (≈prolactinoma) | 35% | ACTH (≈Cushing's disease) | 7% |
| GH only (≈acromegaly) | 20% | LH/FSH/TSH | ≥1%* |
| PRL and GH | 7% | No obvious hormone | 30% |

*Sensitive methods of TSH measurement have improved recognition of TSH-secreting tumours. These are now more frequently found at microadenoma stage, medially located, and without associated hormone hypersecretion. In these tumours, somatostatin analogues (p238) are very helpful. See also Socin et al. Eur J Endocrinol. 2003;148:433-42.

10 If <1cm, usually 'incidentaloma'; most non-functioning macroadenomas are revealed by mass effect and/or hypopituitarism. Here, recurrence after surgery is common, so follow carefully with MRIs.
