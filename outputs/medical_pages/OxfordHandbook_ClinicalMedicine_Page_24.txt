# Surviving life on the wards

## The ward round
- All entries on the patient record must have: date, time, the name of the clinician leading the interaction, the clinical findings and plan, your signature, printed name, and contact details. Make sure the patient details are at the top of every side of paper. Write legibly—this may save more than the patient.
- A problem list will help you structure your thoughts and guide others.
- BODEX: Blood results, Observations, Drug chart, ECG, X-rays. Look at these. If you think there is something of concern, make sure someone else looks at them too.
- Document what information has been given to the patient and relatives.

## Handover
- Make sure you know when and where to attend.
- Make sure you understand what you need to do and why. 'Check blood results' or 'Review warning score' is not enough. Better to: 'Check potassium in 4 hours and discuss with a senior if it remains >6.0mmol/L'.

## On call
- Write it down.
- The ABCDE approach (p779) to a sick patient is never wrong.
- Try and establish the clinical context of tasks you are asked to do. Prioritize and let staff know when you are likely to get to them.
- Learn the national early warning score (NEWS) (p892, fig A1).
- Smile, even when talking by phone. Be polite.
- Eat and drink, preferably with your team.

## Making a referral
- Have the clinical notes, observation chart, drug chart, and investigation results to hand. Read them before you call.
- Use SBAR: Situation (who you are, who the patient is, the reason for the call), Background, Assessment of the patient now, Request.
- Anticipate: urine dip for the nephrologist, PR exam for the gastroenterologist.

## Living with blood spattered armour

With the going down of the sun we can momentarily cheer ourselves up by the thought that we are one day nearer to the end of life on earth—and our responsibility for the unending tide of illness that floods into our corridors, and seeps into our wards and consulting rooms. Of course you may have many other quiet satisfactions, but if not, read on and wink with us as we hear some fool telling us that our aim should be to produce the greatest health and happiness for the greatest number. When we hear this, we don't expect cheering from the tattered ranks of on-call doctors; rather, our ears detect a decimated groan, because these men and women know that there is something at stake in on-call doctoring far more elemental than health or happiness: namely survival.

Within the first weeks, however brightly your armour shone, it will now be smeared and spattered, if not with blood, then with the fallout from the many decisions that were taken without sufficient care and attention. Force majeure on the part of Nature and the exigencies of ward life have, we are suddenly stunned to realize, taught us to be second-rate; for to insist on being first-rate in all areas is to sign a death warrant for ourselves and our patients. Don't keep re-polishing your armour, for perfectionism does not survive untarnished in our clinical world. Rather, to flourish, furnish your mind and nourish your body. Regular food makes midnight groans less intrusive. Drink plenty: doctors are more likely to be oliguric than their patients. And do not voluntarily deny yourself the restorative power of sleep, for it is our natural state, in which we were first created, and we only wake to feed our dreams.

We cannot prepare you for finding out that you are not at ease with the person you are becoming, and neither would we dream of imposing a specific regimen of exercise, diet, and mental fitness. Finding out what can lead you through adversity is the art of living.
