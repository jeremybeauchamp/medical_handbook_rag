| Normal | >80% predicted | >80% predicted | 75-80% |
| Restrictive | <80% predicted | <80% predicted | >70% normal |
| Obstructive | <80% predicted | Normal or low | <70% predicted |

| FEV₁ = 4.0 | FEV₁ = 1.3 | FEV₁ = 2.8 |

The image shows three graphs representing spirograms for normal, obstructive, and restrictive lung conditions. Each graph plots volume (in liters) over time, with characteristic curves for each condition. The normal graph shows a rapid rise to peak volume, while the obstructive graph shows a slower rise and lower peak. The restrictive graph shows a rapid rise but to a lower overall volume compared to normal.
