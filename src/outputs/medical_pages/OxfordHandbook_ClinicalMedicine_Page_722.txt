## Eponymous syndromes

### Ortner's cardiovocal syndrome
Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy from a large left atrium (eg from mitral stenosis) or aortic dissection.
*Norbert Ortner, 1865–1935 (Austrian physician)*

### Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (Hereditary telangiectasia.)
Autosomal dominant telangiectasia of skin & mucous membranes (causing epistaxis and GI bleeds), see fig 15.12. Associated with pulmonary, hepatic, and cerebral arteriovenous malformations.
*William Osler, 1849-1919 (Canadian); Frederick Weber, 1863-1962 (British); Henri Rendu, 1844-1902 (French)—physicians*

### Paget's disease of the breast (PDB)
Intra-epidermal spread of an intraduct cancer, which can look just like eczema. ▶Any red, scaly lesion at the nipple (see fig 15.13) must suggest PDB: do a biopsy. ℞: Breast-conserving surgery + radiotherapy. Sentinel node biopsy should be performed.
*Sir James Paget, 1814-1899 (British surgeon)*

### Pancoast's syndrome
Apical lung ca invades the sympathetic plexus in the neck (→ipsilateral Horner's, p702) ± brachial plexus (→arm pain ± weakness) ± recurrent laryngeal nerve (→hoarse voice/bovine cough).
*Henry Pancoast, 1875-1939 (US radiologist)*

### Parinaud's syndrome (Dorsal midbrain syndrome.)
Upward gaze palsy + pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils (p72) ± bilateral papilloedema. Causes: Pineal or midbrain tumours; upper brainstem stroke; MS.
*Henry Parinaud, 1844-1905 (French neuro-ophthalmologist)*

### Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome
Dominant germline mutations of tumour suppressor gene STK11 (in 66-94%) cause mucocutaneous dark freckles on lips (fig 15.14), oral mucosa, palms and soles, + multiple GI polyps (hamartomas), causing obstruction, intussusception, or bleeds. There is a 15-fold risk of developing GI cancer: perform colonoscopy (from age 18yrs) and OGD (from age 25yrs) every 3yrs. NB: hamartomas are excessive focal overgrowths of normal cells in an organ composed of the same cell type.
*Johannes LA Peutz, 1886-1957 (Dutch physician); Harold J Jeghers, 1904-1990 (US physician)*

### Peyronie's disease (Penile angulation.)
Pathogenesis: A poorly understood connective tissue disorder most commonly attributed to repetitive microvascular trauma during sexual intercourse, resulting in penile curvature and painful erectile dysfunction (in 50%; p230). Prevalence: 3-9%. Typical age: >40yrs. Associations: Dupuytren's (p698); atheroma; radical prostatectomy. ∆∆: Haemangioma. Tests: Ultrasound/MRI. ℞: Oral potassium para-aminobenzoate (Potaba®), intralesional verapamil, clostridial collagenase, or interferon α2B; topical verapamil 15% gel; iontophoresis with verapamil and dexamethasone. All have various success. Surgery: (If disease stable for >3 months) tunica plication ± penile prostheses. Manage associated depression (seen in 48%). Penile rehabilitation can help (p230).
*Francois Gigot de la Peyronie, 1678-1747 (French surgeon)*

### Pott's syndrome (Spinal TB.)
Rare in the West, this is usually from an extra-spinal source, eg lungs. Features: Backache, and stiffness of all back movements. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss occur. Progressive bone destruction leads to vertebral collapse and gibbus (sharply angled spinal curvature). Abscess formation may lead to cord compression, causing paraplegia, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (p466). X-rays: (fig 15.15) Narrow disc spaces and vertebral osteoporosis, leading to destruction with wedging of vertebrae. Lesions in the thoracic spine often lead to kyphosis. Abscess formation in the lumbar spine may track down to the psoas muscle, and erode through the skin. ℞: Anti-TB drugs (p394).
*Sir Percival Pott, 1714-1788 (British surgeon)*

### Prinzmetal (variant) angina
Angina from coronary artery spasm, which may lead to MI, ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death. Severe chest pain occurs without physical exertion. Triggers include hyperventilation, cocaine and tobacco use. ECG: ST elevation. ℞: Establish the diagnosis. GTN treats angina. Use Ca²⁺-channel blockers (p114) and long-acting nitrates as prophylaxis.
*Myron Prinzmetal, 1908-1987 (US cardiologist)*

### Raynaud's syndrome
This is peripheral digital ischaemia due to paroxysmal vasospasm, precipitated by cold or emotion. Fingers or toes ache and change colour: pale (ischaemia) →blue (deoxygenation) →red (reactive hyperaemia). It may be idiopathic (Raynaud's disease—prevalence: 3-20%; ♀:♂ >1:1) or have an underlying cause (Raynaud's phenomenon; fig 15.16). Tests: Exclude an underlying cause (see BOX 'Conditions in which Raynaud's phenomenon may be exhibited'). ℞: Keep warm (eg hand warmers); stop smoking. Nifedipine 5-20mg/8h PO helps, as may evening primrose oil, sildenafil, and epoprostenol (for severe attacks/digital gangrene). Relapse is common. Chemical or surgical (lumbar or digital) sympathectomy may help in those with severe disease.
*AG Maurice Raynaud, 1834-1881 (French physician)*
