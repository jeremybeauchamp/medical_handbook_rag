# Complications of pneumonia

## Respiratory failure
(See p188.) Type I respiratory failure (PaO2 <8kPa) is relatively common. Treatment is with high-flow (60%) oxygen. Transfer the patient to ITU if hypoxia does not improve with O2 therapy or PaCO2 rises to >6kPa. Be careful with O2 in COPD patients; check ABGs frequently, and consider elective ventilation if rising PaCO2 or worsening acidosis. Aim to keep SaO2 at 94-98%, PaO2 ≥8kPa.

## Hypotension
May be due to a combination of dehydration and vasodilation due to sepsis. If systolic BP is <90mmHg, give an intravenous fluid challenge of 250mL colloid/crystalloid over 15min. If BP does not rise, consider a central line and give IV fluids to maintain the systolic BP >90mmHg. If systolic BP remains <90mmHg despite fluid therapy, request ITU assessment for inotropic support.

## Atrial fibrillation
(p130.) Common in the elderly. It usually resolves with treatment of the pneumonia. β-blocker or digoxin may be required to slow the ventricular response rate in the short term.

## Pleural effusion
Inflammation of the pleura by adjacent pneumonia may cause fluid exudation into the pleural space. If this accumulates faster than it is reabsorbed, a pleural effusion develops. If small, it may be of no consequence. If larger and patient symptomatic, or infected (empyema), drainage is required (p192, p766).

## Empyema
Pus in the pleural space. It should be suspected if a patient with a resolving pneumonia develops a recurrent fever. Clinical features: CXR indicates a pleural effusion. The aspirated pleural fluid is typically yellow and turbid with a pH <7.2, glucose, and LDH. The empyema should be drained using a chest drain, inserted under radiological guidance. Adhesions and loculation can make this difficult.

## Lung abscess
A cavitating area of localized, suppurative infection within the lung (see fig 4.6).

### Causes:
- Inadequately treated pneumonia.
- Aspiration (eg alcoholism, oesophageal obstruction, bulbar palsy).
- Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body).
- Pulmonary infarction.
- Septic emboli (septicaemia, right heart endocarditis, IV drug use).
- Subphrenic or hepatic abscess.

### Clinical features:
Swinging fever; cough; purulent, foul-smelling sputum; pleuritic chest pain; haemoptysis; malaise; weight loss. Look for: finger clubbing; anaemia; crepitations. Empyema develops in 20-30%.

### Tests:
Blood: FBC (anaemia, neutrophilia), ESR, CRP, blood cultures. Sputum microscopy, culture, and cytology. CXR: walled cavity, often with a fluid level. Consider CT scan to exclude obstruction, and bronchoscopy to obtain diagnostic specimens.

### Treatment:
Antibiotics as indicated by sensitivities; continue until healed (4-6 wks). Postural drainage. Repeated aspiration, antibiotic instillation, or surgical excision may be required.

## Septicaemia
May occur as a result of bacterial spread from the lung parenchyma into the bloodstream. This may cause metastatic infection, eg infective endocarditis, meningitis. Treat with IV antibiotic according to sensitivities.

## Pericarditis and myocarditis
May also complicate pneumonia.

## Jaundice
This is usually cholestatic, and may be due to sepsis or secondary to antibiotic therapy (particularly flucloxacillin and co-amoxiclav).
