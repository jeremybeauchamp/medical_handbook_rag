## The role of rituximab in untreated follicular lymphoma

Rituximab kills CD20+ve cells by antibody-directed cytotoxicity ± apoptosis induction. It also sensitizes cells to CHOP. It is cost-effective when used with:

- cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP)
- cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP)
- cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisolone, and interferon alfa (CHVPi)
- mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP)
- chlorambucil.

It also has a role in maintaining remission, and in relapsed disease.
