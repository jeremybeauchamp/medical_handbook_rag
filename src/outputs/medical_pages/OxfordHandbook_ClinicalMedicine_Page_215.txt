# Industrial dust diseases

## Coal worker's pneumoconiosis (CWP)
A common dust disease in countries that have or have had underground coal-mines. It results from inhalation of coal dust particles (1-3Î¼m in diameter) over 15-20yrs. These are ingested by macrophages which die, releasing their enzymes and causing fibrosis.

**Clinical features:** Asymptomatic, but coexisting chronic bronchitis is common. CXR: many round opacities (1-10mm), especially in upper zone.

**Management:** Avoid exposure to coal dust; treat co-existing chronic bronchitis; claim compensation (in the UK, via the Industrial Injuries Act).

## Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF)
Due to progression of CWP, which causes progressive dyspnoea, fibrosis, and, eventually, cor pulmonale. CXR: usually bilateral, upper-mid zone fibrotic masses (1-10cm), develop from periphery towards hilum.

**Management:** Avoid exposure to coal dust; claim compensation (as for CWP).

## Caplan's syndrome
The association between rheumatoid arthritis, pneumoconiosis, and pulmonary rheumatoid nodules.

## Silicosis
(See fig 4.21.) Caused by inhalation of silica particles, which are very fibrogenic. A number of jobs may be associated with exposure, eg metal mining, stone quarrying, sandblasting, and pottery/ceramic manufacture.

**Clinical features:** Progressive dyspnoea, incidence of TB, CXR shows diffuse miliary or nodular pattern in upper and mid-zones and egg-shell calcification of hilar nodes. Spirometry: restrictive ventilatory defect.

**Management:** Avoid exposure to silica; claim compensation (as for CWP).

## Asbestosis
Caused by inhalation of asbestos fibres. Asbestos was commonly used in the building trade for fire proofing, pipe lagging, electrical wire insulation, and roofing felt. Degree of asbestos exposure is related to degree of pulmonary fibrosis.

**Clinical features:** Similar to other fibrotic lung diseases with progressive dyspnoea, clubbing, and fine end-inspiratory crackles. Also causes pleural plaques, risk of bronchial adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma.

**Management:** Symptomatic. Patients are often eligible for compensation through the UK Industrial Injuries Act.

## Mesothelioma
