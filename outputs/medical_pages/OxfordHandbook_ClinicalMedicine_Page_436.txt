# Vector-borne disease

Vector borne diseases are infections transmitted by the bite of infected arthropod species including mosquitoes, ticks, flies, and bugs (table 9.21).

## Table 9.21 Vector-borne disease

| Vector/arthropod | Disease | Page |
|------------------|---------|------|
| Mosquito Anopheles | Malaria | 416-9 |
| Aedes | Dengue, Chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika | 420-1 |
| Culex | Lymphatic filariasis, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile | 421,436-7 |
| Ticks | Lyme disease, rickettsial disease, relapsing fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever | 422-3, 426-7 |
| Bugs/Flies | Leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis, loiasis | 423, 439 |
| Snails | Schistosomiasis | 434 |

## Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis)

Tick-borne multisystem disease caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi (or related Borrelia spp). ~All cases limited to northern hemisphere (mainly Europe and US). ~2000-3000 cases/yr in UK. Risk of infection from tick bite is 3-12% in Europe. Presentation: ≥75% remember the tick bite. Peak infection with 48-72h of attachment. Disease stages:

- Early localized (3-30d after bite): erythema migrans (fig 9.31), pain/pruritus, lymphadenopathy, ± constitutional symptoms: fever, malaise, headache. ⅓ do not see a rash.
- Early disseminated (wks-months): borrelial lymphocytoma = bluish-red plaque/nodule: check earlobes, nipples, genitals. Neuroborreliosis: lymphocytic meningitis, ataxia, amnesia, facial/cranial nerve palsies, neuropathy (severe pain, worse at night), encephalomyelitis. Carditis: acute onset 2nd/3rd-degree heart-block, myocarditis.
- Late disseminated (months-yr): acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans = focal inflammation then atrophic skin; Lyme arthritis.

Diagnosis: Clinical: erythema migrans with known exposure or evidence of infection. Borrelia culture (sensitivity: 40-70% for erythema migrans, <20% for CSF), PCR.⁴ Two-tier serology due to false-positive reaction with other spirochaete infection: enzyme immunoassay/immunofluorescence + immunoblot. Sensitivity ↓ due to slow seroconversion: IgM 1-2wks (and may persist), IgG 4-6wks and background positivity 3-15%.

Treatment: Erythema migrans: doxycycline 100mg BD PO for 10-21d (CI <8y, pregnant). Alternatives: amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, azithromycin. Neuroborreliosis: ceftriaxone or IV benzylpenicillin or doxycycline for 10-30d. Arthritis/carditis: doxycyline or amoxicillin or ceftriaxone for 14-30d.¹⁵ Prevention: Keep limbs covered; use insect repellent (DEET); inspect skin and remove ticks (use tweezers, hold close to head/mouth).

## Rickettsial disease

Rickettsiae are obligate, intracellular coccobacillary forms lying between bacteria and viruses. Mammals and arthropods are natural hosts. Risk with rural activities eg camping, hiking, hunting. Divided into:

- Spotted fevers: eg Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Americas); rickettsialpox (∆∆ chicken-pox).
- Typhus: scrub typhus in Asia-Pacific regions; endemic (flea-borne) typhus in tropical areas; epidemic (louse-borne) typhus in homeless populations, eg refugees.
- Other emerging illnesses: eg ehrlichia, anaplasma.

Presentation: Incubation ~1-2wks. Fever, headache, malaise, rash (maculopapular, vesicular or petechial), N&V, myalgia. Check for local lymphadenopathy and an eschar at the site of the bite (scrub typhus). Wide variation in severity depending on aetiology. Fulminant, life-threatening infection possible with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, louse-borne typhus, scrub typhus. Diagnosis: Clinical: fever + rash + travel to an endemic area. Serology, culture/PCR of blood/skin biopsy. Treatment: Antibiotics in severe cases: doxycycline, azithromycin, chloramphenicol.
