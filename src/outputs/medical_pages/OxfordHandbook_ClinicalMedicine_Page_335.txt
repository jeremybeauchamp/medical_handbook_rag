## Cystinuria

1 in 17000. Autosomal recessive defect prevents reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids in proximal tubule. Leads to cystinuria and cystine stone formation. Treatment: diet, fluid intake, and urine alkalinization. Current drugs which increase cystine solubility have adverse side-effect profiles.

## Cystinosis

1 in 100000-200000. Autosomal recessive. Lysosomal storage disorder with accumulation of cystine. In nephropathic forms causes proximal tubule dysfunction, Fanconi syndrome (p316), and progressive renal impairment. Also visual impairment, myopathy, hypothyroidism. Oral cysteamine â†“intralysosomal cystine, and delays ESRF, but is poorly tolerated (GI symptoms, skin deposits, fever, seizures).

The progressive increase in size can lead to abdominal discomfort. There may be
haemorrhage into a cyst causing haematuria, or infection.
