# Acute management of sepsis in adults

## Recognize the need to assess for sepsis
- Consider possibility of sepsis in any patient with signs or symptoms that are suggestive of infection (eg productive cough or offensive oozing wound)
- Consider non-specific signs (patient/carer concern; altered mental state; feeling generally unwell), particularly when there is reason to have low threshold for sepsis assessment (see BOX)

## Gather information
**History:** Full medical history: take time to clarify the time course of symptoms and any travel history

**Examination:**
- General: capillary refill time, mottled/ashen skin, conscious level
- Localize source of infection: don't forget to assess wounds/ulcers which may be hidden by dressings

**Bedside tests:** Blood gas for lactate, observations incl. HR, BP, RR, sats, temperature; ECG; urine dip and urine output monitoring

## Assess risk (see BOX)

| High risk | Moderate to high risk | Low risk |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| Request immediate senior review | Clinician review within 1h. Senior review within 3h if cause not identified | Manage according to clinical judgement |

## Investigations
**Blood tests:** Serial ABGs, or VBGs for lactate; blood cultures; U&E, CRP, FBC, LFT, clotting screen

**Micro samples:** Sputum and urine for MC&S; swab any wounds; consider LP; send fluid from drains and lines; joint aspirates; ascitic tap

**Imaging:** CXR, consider CT/USS/MRI/echo of suspected source

## Treatment
- Antibiotics Â± other antimicrobials
- Fluids
- Oxygen
- Liaise with other teams
  - Critical care, surgeons, medical specialties
- Manage acute complications

## Review
Immediately alert a consultant if, after 1h of antibiotics and fluids:
- SBP <90
- RR >30
- Reduced GCS
- Raised lactate not reduced by >20%
- Consider critical care referral.
