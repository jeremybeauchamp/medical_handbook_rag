*Milder disease may present as diarrhoea without blood.

## Traveller's diarrhoea

Diarrhoea affects 20-60% of travellers. High-risk areas: South Asia, Central and South America, Africa. Major cause = enterotoxigenic E. coli.

### Prevention:
Boil water, cook thoroughly, peel fruit and vegetables. Avoid ice, salads, shellfish. Drink with a straw. Hand washing with soap may ↓ risk.

### Presentation:
Most diarrhoea is during first week of travel. Symptoms are often unreliable indicators of aetiology but the following may be indicative:
- Enterotoxigenic E. coli: watery diarrhoea preceded by cramps and nausea.
- Giardia lamblia: upper GI symptoms, eg bloating, belching.
- Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella: colitic symptoms, urgency, cramps.

Duration of diarrhoea: most <1wk, 10%>1wk, 5% >2wks, 1%>30d.

### Treatment:
- Oral rehydration. Clear fluid or oral rehydration salts. Home-made oral rehydration recipe: 6 level teaspoons of sugar + half level teaspoon salt in 1L clean, drinking water.
- Antimotility agents, eg loperamide, bismuth subsalicylates. Avoid if severe pain or bloody diarrhoea as may indicate invasive colitis.
- Antibiotics: usually not indicated. Considered if rapid cessation of diarrhoea needed and/or limited access to sanitation/healthcare. Reduce diarrhoea from ~3 to ~1.5 days. Choice depends on allergy, comorbidity, concomitant medication, and destination of travel: ciprofloxacin 500mg BD for 3d (care quinolone resistance, eg SE Asia), rifaximin 200mg TDS for 3d, azithromycin 1g single dose or 500mg OD for 3d.

### Prophylaxis:
Not recommended as severe disease and long-term sequelae rare, risk of C. difficile. Consider in immunosuppressed (transplant, HIV, chemotherapy), GI pathology (IBD, ileostomy, short-bowel), ↑risk with dehydration (sickle cell, CKD). Care with interactions with usual medications.
- Ciprofloxacin 500mg OD (80-100% protection).
- Norfloxacin 400mg OD (75-95% protection).
- Rifaximin 200mg every 12-24h (72-77% protection).
- Bismuth subsalicylate 2 tablets QDS (62-65% protection, 1st line in US).

### Persistent diarrhoea:
Investigate if >14d or dysentery: FBC, U&E, LFT, inflammatory markers, stool microscopy for ova/cysts/parasites (historically 3 samples but may not actually improve diagnostic yield, time intensive), molecular testing for (pre-defined) microbes. ∆∆ of persistent diarrhoea = Giardia (most common diagnosis, send PCR), Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella. Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion (in up to 30%).

Do not forget: malaria, HIV.
