*Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP): autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves (distal onset of weakness/sensory loss in limbs + nerve enlargement + ↑CSF protein)

## Autonomic neuropathy

Sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathies may be isolated or part of a generalized sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.

**Causes** DM, amyloidosis, Guillain-Barré and Sjögren's syndromes, HIV, leprosy, SLE, toxic, genetic (eg porphyria), or paraneoplastic, eg paraneoplastic encephalomyeloneuropathies and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS, p512).

**Signs** *Sympathetic:* Postural hypotension, ↓sweating, ejaculatory failure, Horner's syndrome (p702). *Parasympathetic:* Constipation, nocturnal diarrhoea, urine retention, erectile dysfunction, Holmes-Adie pupil (p72).

**Autonomic function tests**
• BP: Postural drop of >20/10mmHg is abnormal.
• ECG: A variation of <10bpm with respiration is abnormal (check R-R interval).
• Cystometry: Bladder pressure studies.
• Pupils: Instil 0.1% adrenaline (dilates if post-ganglionic sympathetic denervation, not if normal); 2.5% cocaine (dilates if normal; not if sympathetic denervation); 2.5% methacholine (constricts if parasympathetic lesion)—rarely used.
• Paraneoplastic antibodies: Anti-HU, anti-YO, anti-RI, anti-amphiphysin, anti-CV2, anti-MA2. Other Ab: Antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody presence shows that the cause may be autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.

**Primary autonomic failure** Occurs alone (autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy), as part of multisystem atrophy (MSA, p494), or with Parkinson's disease, typically in a middle-aged/elderly man. Onset: insidious; symptoms as listed previously.
