## Jaundice

Jaundice refers to yellowing of skin, sclerae, and mucosae from ↑plasma bilirubin (visible at ≥60μmol/L fig 6.24). Jaundice is classified by the site of the problem (pre-hepatic, hepatocellular, or cholestatic/obstructive) or by the type of circulating bilirubin (conjugated or unconjugated, fig 6.25).

### Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
As unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble, it does not enter urine, resulting in unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.

- **Overproduction:** Haemolysis (p338, eg malaria/DIC, etc); ineffective erythropoiesis.
- **Impaired hepatic uptake:** Drugs (paracetamol, rifampicin), ischaemic hepatitis.
- **Impaired conjugation:** Eponymous syndromes: Gilbert's, p700; Crigler-Najjar, p696.
- **Physiological neonatal jaundice:** Caused by a combination of the above, OHCS p115.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
As conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble, it is excreted in urine, making it dark. Less conjugated bilirubin enters the gut and the faeces become pale. When severe, it can be associated with an intractable pruritus which is best treated by relief of the obstruction.

#### Hepatocellular dysfunction:
There is hepatocyte damage, usually with some cholestasis. **Causes:** Viruses: hepatitis (p278), CMV (p405), EBV (p405); drugs (see table 6.10); alcohol; cirrhosis (see BOX 'Causes of jaundice'); liver metastases/abscess; haemochromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); septicaemia; leptospirosis; syphilis; α1-antitrypsin deficiency (p290); Budd-Chiari (p696); Wilson's disease (p285); failure to excrete conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson & Rotor syndromes, p698, p710); right heart failure; toxins, eg carbon tetrachloride; fungi (fig 6.26).

#### Impaired hepatic excretion (cholestasis):
Primary biliary cholangitis; primary sclerosing cholangitis; drugs (see table 6.10); common bile duct gallstones; pancreatic cancer; compression of the bile duct, eg lymph nodes at the porta hepatis; cholangiocarcinoma; choledochal cyst; Caroli's disease;²³ Mirrizi's syndrome (obstructive jaundice from common bile duct compression by a gallstone impacted in the cystic duct, often associated with cholangitis).

### The patient
**Ask:** About blood transfusions, IV drug use, body piercing, tattoos, sexual activity, travel abroad, jaundiced contacts, family history, alcohol use, and all medications (eg old drug charts; GP records). **Examine:** For signs of chronic liver disease (p276), hepatic encephalopathy (p275), lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, and a palpable gallbladder (if seen with painless jaundice the cause is not gallstones—Courvoisier's 'law').²⁴ Pale stools + dark urine ≈ cholestatic jaundice.

### Tests
See p276 for screening tests in suspected liver disease. **Urine:** Bilirubin is absent in pre-hepatic causes; in obstructive jaundice, urobilinogen is absent. **Haematology:** FBC, clotting, film, reticulocyte count, Coombs' test and haptoglobins for haemolysis (p336), malaria parasites (eg if unconjugated bilirubin/fever); Paul-Bunnell (EBV). **Chemistry:** U&E, LFT, γ-GT, total protein, albumin.²⁵ Paracetamol levels. **Microbiology:** Blood and other cultures; hepatitis serology. **Ultrasound:** Are the bile ducts dilated? Are there gallstones, hepatic metastases, or a pancreatic mass? **ERCP:** (See p742.) If bile ducts are dilated and LFT not improving. **MRCP:** (See p742.) Or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if conventional ultrasound shows gallstones but no definite common bile duct stones. **Liver biopsy:** (See p248.) If bile ducts are normal. Consider abdominal CT/MRI if abdominal malignancy is suspected.

### What to do?
▶ Treat the cause promptly. Ensure adequate hydration; broad-spectrum antibiotics if obstruction. Monitor for ascites, encephalopathy; call a hepatologist.

²³ Multiple segmental cystic or saccular dilatations of intrahepatic bile ducts with congenital hepatic fibrosis. It may present in 20yr-olds, with portal hypertension ± recurrent cholangitis/cholelithiasis.

²⁴ Pancreatic or gallbladder cancer is more likely, as stones lead to a fibrotic, unexpandable gallbladder.

²⁵ Albumin & INR are the best indicators of hepatic synthetic function. Transaminases (ALT, AST) indicate hepatocyte damage. ALP suggests obstructive jaundice, but also occurs in hepatocellular jaundice, malignant infiltration, pregnancy (placental isoenzyme), Paget's disease, and childhood (bone isoenzyme).
