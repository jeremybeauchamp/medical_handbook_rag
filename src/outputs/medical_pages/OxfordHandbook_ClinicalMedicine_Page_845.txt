    A[ABC]
    B[Correct hypotension, maintain MAP >90mmHg and treat seizures]
    C[Brief examination; history if available:<br>Any clues, eg meningococcal rash, previous carcinoma]
    D[Elevate the head of the bed to 30-40°]
    E[If intubated, hyperventilate to ↓PaCO2 (aim 3.5-4kPa):<br>This causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP almost<br>immediately. Maintain PaO2 >12kPa]
    F[Osmotic agents (eg mannitol) can be useful but<br>may lead to rebound ICP after prolonged use (~12-24h):<br>Give 20% solution 0.25-0.5g/kg IV over 10-20min (eg 5mL/kg).<br>Effect is seen after ~20min and lasts for 2-6h. Follow serum<br>osmolality—aim for about 300mosmol/kg but don't exceed 310]
    G[Corticosteroids are not effective in reducing ICP<br>except for oedema surrounding tumours:<br>Eg dexamethasone 10mg IV and follow with 4mg/6h IV/PO]
    H[Consider other measures,<br>eg sedation, anti-epileptics, therapeutic hypothermia]
    I[Restrict fluid to <1.5L/d]
    J[Monitor the patient closely; consider monitoring ICP]
    K[Aim to make a diagnosis]
    L[Treat cause or exacerbating factors,<br>eg hyperglycaemia, hyponatraemia]
    M[Definitive treatment if possible]
