## Pneumothorax

### Causes
- Spontaneous: (Especially in young thin men) due to rupture of a subpleural bulla.
- Chronic lung disease: Asthma; COPD; cystic fibrosis; lung fibrosis; sarcoidosis.
- Infection: TB; pneumonia; lung abscess.
- Traumatic: Including iatrogenic (CVP line insertion, pleural aspiration or biopsy, percutaneous liver biopsy, positive pressure ventilation).
- Carcinoma.
- Connective tissue disorders: Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Clinical features
**Symptoms:** Can be asymptomatic (especially in fit young people with small pneumothoraces) or sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Patients with asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically ventilated patients can suddenly develop hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures.

**Signs:** Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the affected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be deviated away from the affected side and the patient will be very unwell.

### Tests
A CXR should not be performed if a tension pneumothorax is suspected, as it will delay immediate necessary treatment. Otherwise, request an expiratory film, and look for an area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to the edge of the collapsed lung (see p725). Ensure the suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous bulla. Check ABG in dyspnoeic/hypoxic patients and those with chronic lung disease.

### Management
See fig 19.14. Depends on whether it is a primary pneumothorax or secondary (=underlying lung disease or smoker >50yrs old), size, and symptoms.
- Size is measured from the visible lung margin to chest wall at level of the hilum.
- Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires a chest drain.
- Aspiration of a pneumothorax, see p767.
- Insertion and management of a chest drain, see p766. Use a small tube (10-14F) unless blood/pus is also present. Tubes may be removed 24h after the lung has re-expanded and air leak has stopped (ie the tube stops bubbling). This is done during expiration or a Valsalva manoeuvre.

**Surgical advice:** Arrange if: bilateral pneumothoraces; lung fails to expand within 48h of intercostal drain insertion; persistent air leak; two or more previous pneumothoraces on the same side; or history of pneumothorax on the opposite side.

## Tension pneumothorax

This is a medical emergency. (See fig 16.43, p749.)

### Essence
Air drawn into the pleural space with each inspiration has no route of escape during expiration. The mediastinum is pushed over into the contralateral hemithorax, kinking and compressing the great veins. Unless the air is rapidly removed, cardiorespiratory arrest will occur.

### Signs
Respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, trachea deviated away from side of pneumothorax. Increased percussion note, reduced air entry/breath sounds on the affected side.

### Treatment
To remove the air, insert a large-bore (14-16G) needle with a syringe, partially filled with 0.9% saline, into the 2nd intercostal interspace in the midclavicular line on the side of the suspected pneumothorax. Remove plunger to allow the trapped air to bubble through the syringe (with saline as a water seal) until a chest tube can be placed. Alternatively, insert a large-bore Venflon in the same location.

Do this before requesting a CXR.

Then insert a chest drain. See p766.
