# 510 Myopathy

Primary disorder of muscle with gradual-onset symmetrical weakness; it may be confused clinically with neuropathy. In favour of myopathy:
- Gradual onset of symmetric proximal weakness—difficulty combing hair and climbing stairs (NB: weakness is also distal in myotonic dystrophy).
- Specific muscle groups affected (ie selective weakness on first presentation).
- Preserved tendon reflexes.
- No paraesthesiae or bladder problems.
- No fasciculation (suggests anterior horn cell or root disease).

Rapid onset suggests a toxic, drug, or metabolic myopathy (or a neuropathy). Excess fatigability (weakness with exercise) suggests myasthenia (p512). Spontaneous pain at rest and local tenderness occurs in inflammatory myopathies. Pain on exercise suggests ischaemia or metabolic myopathy (eg McArdle's disease). Oddly firm muscles (due to infiltrations with fat or connective tissue) suggest pseudo-hypertrophic muscular dystrophies (eg Duchenne's).

## Tests
ESR, CK, AST, and LDH may be raised. Do EMG and tests relevant to systemic causes (eg TSH, p216). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing may help reach a diagnosis.

## Muscular dystrophies
A group of genetic diseases (see table 10.12) with progressive degeneration and weakness of specific muscle groups. The primary abnormality may be in the muscle membrane. There may be unusually firm muscles due to infiltration by fat or connective tissue, and marked variation in size of individual muscle fibres on histology.

- **Duchenne's muscular dystrophy**: The commonest (3/1000 male live births). Presents at ~4yrs old with clumsy walking, then difficulty in standing, and respiratory failure. Pseudohypertrophy is seen, especially in the calves. Serum creatine kinase ↑ >40-fold. There is no specific treatment. Some survive beyond 20yrs. Home ventilation improves prognosis. Genetic counselling is vital.
- **Becker's muscular dystrophy**: (~0.3/1000 ♂ births.) Presents similarly to Duchenne's but with milder symptoms, at a later age, and with a better prognosis.
- **Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy**: (FSHD, Landouzy-Dejerine.) Almost as common as Duchenne's. Onset is ~12-14yrs old, with inability to puff out the cheeks and difficulty raising the arms above the head. Signs: weakness of face ('ironed out' expression), shoulders, and upper arms (often asymmetric with deltoids spared), foot-drop, scapular winging (fig 10.31), scoliosis, anterior axillary folds, and horizontal clavicles. ≤20% need a wheelchair by 40yrs.

## Myotonic disorders
Cause tonic muscle spasm (myotonia), and demonstrate long chains of central nuclei within muscle fibres on histology. The commonest is myotonic dystrophy which is, in fact, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with two major forms (DM1 and DM2—see table 10.12), both showing abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansions in regulatory (non-coding) genetic regions. DM1 is the commoner, more severe, and typically presents between 20-40 yrs old with distal weakness (hand/foot drop), weak sternomastoids, and myotonia. Facial weakness and muscle wasting give a long, haggard appearance. Also: cataracts, male frontal baldness, diabetes, testis/ovary atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and ↓cognition. Most DM1 patients die in late middle age of respiratory or cardiac complications. Mexiletine may help with disabling myotonia. Genetic counselling is important.

## Inflammatory myopathies
There may be spontaneous muscle pain at rest and local tenderness on palpation. Inclusion body myositis is the chief example if aged >50yrs. Weakness starts with quadriceps, finger flexors, or pharyngeal muscles. Ventral extremity muscle groups are more affected than dorsal or girdle groups. Response to therapy is poor and patients typically progress over a decade to require assistance with activities of daily living. Histology shows ringed vacuoles + intranuclear inclusions. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis, see p552.

## Metabolic myopathies
Eg McArdle's disease (glycogen storage disorder). Presents with muscle pain and weakness after exercise.

## Acquired myopathies of late onset
Often part of systemic disease—eg hyperthyroidism, malignancy, Cushing's, hypo- and hypercalcaemia.

## Drug causes
Alcohol; statins; steroids; chloroquine; zidovudine; vincristine; cocaine.
