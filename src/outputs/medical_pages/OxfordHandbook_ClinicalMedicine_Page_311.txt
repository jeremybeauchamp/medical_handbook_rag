# Managing UTI

> Do not use antibiotics for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-pregnant women, men, and adults with catheters.

## Non-pregnant women:
- If three or more symptoms (or one severe) of cystitis, and no vaginal discharge, treat empirically with 3-day course of trimethoprim, or nitrofurantoin (if eGFR >30).
- If first-line empirical treatment fails, culture urine and treat according to antibiotic sensitivity.
- In upper UTI, take a urine culture and treat initially with a broad-spectrum antibiotic according to local guidelines/sensitivities, eg co-amoxiclav. Hospitalization should be considered due to risk of antibiotic resistance. Avoid nitrofurantoin as it does not achieve effective concentrations in the blood.

## Pregnant women:
Get expert help: UTI in pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be confirmed on a second sample. Treat with an antibiotic. Refer to local guidance advice for antibiotic choice (avoid ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim in 1st trimester, nitrofurantoin in 3rd trimester). Confirm eradication.

## Men:
- Treat lower UTI with a 7-day course of trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin (if eGFR >30).
- If symptoms suggest prostatitis (pain in pelvis, genitals, lower back, buttocks) consider a longer (4-week) course of a fluoroquinolone (eg ciprofloxacin) due to ability to penetrate prostatic fluid.
- If upper or recurrent UTI, refer for urological investigation.

## Catheterized patients:
- All catheterized patients are bacteriuric. Send MSU only if symptomatic. Symptoms of UTI may be non-specific/atypical. Possible symptoms include fever, flank/suprapubic pain, change in voiding pattern, vomiting, confusion, sepsis.
- Change long-term catheter before starting an antibiotic.
- Refer to local guidelines for initial antibiotic choice. Where possible use a narrow-spectrum antibiotic according to culture sensitivity.

## Urinary tract tuberculosis
- A cause of sterile pyuria: dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain but negative standard culture. Ask about malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, back/flank pain, visible haematuria (p393).
- Can also cause an interstitial nephritis (p318) and renal amyloidosis (p315). Glomerulonephritis is rare.
- Diagnose by microscopy with acid-fast techniques and mycobacterial culture of an early morning MSU and/or urinary tract tissue.
- Treat with rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months in conjunction with pyrazinamide and ethambutol for 2 months (see p394).

## The 'Piss Prophets'

*Beware the fallacies, deceit and juggling of the piss-pot science used by all those who pretend knowledge of diseases by the urine.* Thomas Brian, 1655.

Medieval texts¹ give the following maxims regarding urinary change and disease:
- White or straw coloured urine = weak and cold liver and stomach
- Foamy urine = eructation (belching)
- Light coloured, turbid urine = mucus
- Lead circle on thin urine = pathological melancholy
- Bubbles on the surface = disease of the head
- Watery urine = love sickness
- Swampy, black, stinking urine = fatal
- Lead coloured urine = a disintegrating uterus
- Reddish, cloudy urine with bubbles = asthma or an irregular heart beat.
