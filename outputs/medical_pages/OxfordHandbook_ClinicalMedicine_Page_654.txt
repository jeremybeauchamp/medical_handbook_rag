640 Urinary tract obstruction

Urinary tract obstruction is common and should be considered in any patient with impaired renal function. Damage can be permanent if the obstruction is not treated promptly. Obstruction may occur anywhere from the renal calyces to the urethral meatus, and may be partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Obstructing lesions are luminal (stones, blood clot, sloughed papilla, tumour: renal, ureteric, or bladder), mural (eg congenital or acquired stricture, neuromuscular dysfunction, schistosomiasis), or extra-mural (abdominal or pelvic mass/tumour, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or iatrogenic—eg post surgery). Unilateral obstruction may be clinically silent (normal urine output and U&E) if the other kidney is functioning. Bilateral obstruction or obstruction with infection requires urgent treatment. See p641.

## Clinical features
- **Acute upper tract obstruction:** Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be superimposed infection ± loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney.
- **Chronic upper tract obstruction:** Flank pain, renal failure, superimposed infection. Polyuria may occur due to impaired urinary concentration.
- **Acute lower tract obstruction:** Acute urinary retention typically presents with severe suprapubic pain ± acute confusion (elderly); often acute on chronic (hence preceded by chronic symptoms, see next bullet point). Clinically: distended, palpable bladder containing ~600mL, dull to percussion. Causes include prostatic obstruction (usual cause in older ♂), urethral strictures, anticholinergics, blood clots eg from bladder lesion ('clot retention'), alcohol, constipation, post-op (pain/inflammation/ anaesthetics), infection (p296), neurological (cauda equina syndrome, see p466).
- **Chronic lower tract obstruction:** Symptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, poor stream, terminal dribbling, overflow incontinence. Signs: distended, palpable bladder (capacity may be >1.5L) ± large prostate on PR. Complications: UTI, urinary retention, renal failure (eg bilateral obstructive uropathy—see BOX 'Obstructive uropathy'). Causes include prostatic enlargement (common); pelvic malignancy; rectal surgery; DM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2–S4).

## Tests 
Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA, p530).¹² Urine: Dipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p744) is the imaging modality of choice for investigating upper tract obstruction: If there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter (distension of the renal pelvis and calyces or ureter), arrange a CT scan. This will determine the level of obstruction. NB: in ~5% of cases of obstruction, no distension is seen on US. Radionuclide imaging enables functional assessment of the kidneys.

## Treatment
**Upper tract obstruction:** Nephrostomy or ureteric stent. NB: stents may cause significant discomfort and patients should be warned of this and other risks (see BOX 'Problems of ureteric stenting'). α-blockers help reduce stent-related pain (ureteric spasm). Pyeloplasty, to widen the PUJ, may be performed for idiopathic PUJ obstruction.

**Lower tract obstruction:** Insert a urethral or suprapubic catheter (p762) to relieve acute retention. In chronic obstruction only catheterize patient if there is pain, urinary infection, or renal impairment; intermittent self-catheterization is sometimes required (p763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and bladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diuresis (see BOX 'Obstructive uropathy'). Monitor weight, fluid balance, and U&E closely. Treat the underlying cause if possible, eg if prostatic obstruction, start an α-blocker (see p642). After 2-3 days, trial without catheter (TWOC, p763) may work (especially if <75yrs old and <1L drained or retention was triggered by a passing event, eg GA).

¹² Do venepuncture for PSA before PR, as PR can ↑ total PSA by ~1ng/mL (free PSA ↑ by 10%). It's difficult to know if acute retention raises PSA, but relieving obstruction does cause it to drop.
