# 166 Pneumonia

An acute lower respiratory tract infection associated with fever, symptoms and signs in the chest, and abnormalities on the chest x-ray—fig 16.2, p723. Incidence: 5-11/1000, ↑ if very young or old (30% are under 65yrs). Mortality: ~21% in hospital.

## Classification and causes

### Community-acquired pneumonia: 
(CAP) May be primary or secondary to underlying disease. Typical organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae (commonest), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Atypicals: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, and Chlamydia. Gram-negative bacilli, Coxiella burnetii and anaerobes are rarer (?aspiration). Viruses account for up to 15%. Flu may be complicated by community-acquired MRSA pneumonia.

### Hospital-acquired: 
Defined as >48h after hospital admission. Most commonly Gram-negative enterobacteria or Staph. aureus. Also Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, and Clostridia.

### Aspiration: 
Those with stroke, myasthenia, bulbar palsies, ↓consciousness (eg post-ictal or intoxicated), oesophageal disease (achalasia, reflux), or poor dental hygiene risk aspirating oropharyngeal anaerobes.

### Immunocompromised patient: 
Strep. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Staph. aureus, M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, Gram -ve bacilli and Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly named P. carinii, pp400-1). Other fungi, viruses (CMV, HSV), and mycobacteria.

## Clinical features 
**Symptoms:** Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, purulent sputum, haemoptysis, and pleuritic pain. **Signs:** Pyrexia, cyanosis, confusion (can be the only sign in the elderly—may also be hypothermic), tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (reduced expansion, dull percussion, ↑tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), and a pleural rub.

## Tests 
Assess oxygenation: oxygen saturation, p162 (ABGs if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia) and BP. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP (GPs should consider a point of care CRP to guide antibiotic prescribing where LRTI is suspected, NICE 2014⁴).

CXR (fig 16.2, p723): lobar or multilobar infiltrates, cavitation, or pleural effusion. Sputum for microscopy and culture. Urine: check for Legionella/Pneumococcal urinary antigens. Atypical organism/viral serology (PCR sputum/BAL, complement fixation tests acutely, paired serology). Pleural fluid may be aspirated for culture. Respiratory physicians may consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if patient is immunocompromised or on ITU.

## Severity 
'CURB-65' is a simple, validated severity scoring system.⁵,⁶ 1 point for each of:

- Confusion (abbreviated mental test ≤8)
- Urea >7mmol/L
- Respiratory rate ≥30/min
- BP <90 systolic and/or 60mmHg diastolic)
- Age ≥65.

0-1, PO antibiotic/home treatment; 2, hospital therapy; ≥3, severe pneumonia indicates mortality 15-40%—consider ITU. It may 'underscore' the young—use clinical judgement. Other features increasing the risk of death are: comorbidity; bilateral/multilobar; PaO2 <8kPa.

## Management 
▶p816. Antibiotics—refer to your local hospital antibiotic policy. When none exists, consult table 4.2. If pneumonia not severe and not vomiting (CURB-65 1-2) give PO antibiotic; severe (CURB-65 >2) give IV. Oxygen: keep PaO2 >8.0 and/or saturation ≥94%. IV fluids (anorexia, dehydration, shock) and VTE prophylaxis. Analgesia if pleurisy. Consider ITU if shock, hypercapnia, or remains hypoxic. Follow-up: at 6 weeks (±CXR).

## Complications 
(See p170.) Pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, respiratory failure, septicaemia, brain abscess, pericarditis, myocarditis, cholestatic jaundice. Repeat CRP and CXR in patients not improving to look for progression/complications.
