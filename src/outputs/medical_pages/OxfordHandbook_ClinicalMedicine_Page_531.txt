# Retroviruses and neurology

HIV and AIDS (p398.) Can have multiple neurological manifestations; these conditions are part of the differential diagnosis of meningitis, intracranial mass lesions, dementia, encephalomyelitis, cord problems, and peripheral neuropathies.

**Acute infection:** May be associated with transient aseptic meningoencephalitis (typically self-limiting), myelopathy, and neuropathy.

**Opportunistic infections:** Arise during low CD4 counts, which allow unusual or atypical organisms to infect the nervous system:
• *Toxoplasma gondii* (p400) is the main CNS pathogen in AIDS, causing cerebral abscesses which present with focal signs, eg seizures, hemiparesis. CT/MRI shows ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions. Treat with pyrimethamine (+folinic acid) + sulfadiazine or clindamycin for 6 months. Continue secondary prophylaxis until CD4 count >200. Pneumocystis prophylaxis also protects against toxoplasmosis.
• *Cryptococcus neoformans* (fig 10.36) causes a chronic meningitis with fever and headache (neck stiffness may be absent). Cognition alters slowly, seizures and coma may follow. Treat with amphotericin followed by fluconazole.
• *Cytomegalovirus* (CMV) can cause encephalopathy.
• *Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy* (PML) is caused by the JC virus. There is progressive white matter inflammation. Mortality even with antiretroviral therapy is around 50% at 1yr.
• Syphilis and TB may also cause meningitis.

**Tumours:** Affecting the CNS include primary cerebral lymphoma (associated with EBV) and B-cell lymphoma. CSF JC virus PCR is useful in distinguishing PML from lymphoma.

**Neuropathies:** Common in HIV, and may be a result of the disease itself or antiretroviral therapy. Up to 30% of patients have a peripheral neuropathy, which is painful and predominantly sensory. Other clinical pictures include polyradiculopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and proximal myopathy.

**Chronic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND):** While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased the incidence of CNS complications in HIV/AIDS, people are living longer with the disease, and chronic complications such as HIV-associated dementia are increasing. This occurs in 7-15%, late in the disease, and usually when the CD4 count is <200. Progressive behavioural changes are seen along with subcortical features: memory loss, poor attention, and bradykinesia. Various encephalopathies may also contribute to this, eg PML.

**Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1)** Is another retrovirus with neurological manifestations, though much more rarely than HIV (~0.5%). It causes: *Tropical spastic paraplegia*, a slowly progressing myelopathy, typically affecting the thoracic area. There may be paraesthesiae, sensory loss, and disorders of micturition. *Demyelinating polyneuropathy* and *ataxia* may also occur.
