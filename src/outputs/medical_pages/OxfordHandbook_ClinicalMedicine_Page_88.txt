## Musculoskeletal hand examination 1

Begin by introducing yourself, obtaining consent to examine and position the patient appropriately. Expose the arms, then ask the patient to rest their hands on a pillow. Start by examining the dorsal surface and then turn the hands over. Always ask about pain or tender areas. Follow the 'look, ask the patient to move, then feel' to avoid causing pain.

### Skin

On both the palm and the dorsum start by inspecting the skin for:
1. Colour—pigmentation of creases, jaundice, palmar erythema (fig 2.44).
2. Consistency—tight (sclerodactyly), thick (DM, acromegaly) (fig 2.39).
3. Characteristic lesions—pulp infarcts, rashes, purpura, spider naevi, telangiectasia, tophi (fig 2.35), scars (eg carpal tunnel release).

### Nails

Look for the same skin changes as the palm, plus tendon xanthomata, plaques, and joint replacement scars, and examine the nails for:
- Pitting and onycholysis (p76).
- Clubbing (p77).
- Nail fold infarcts and splinter haemorrhages.
- Other lesions, eg Beau's lines (fig 2.41, p76), koilonychia, leuconychia (fig 2.36).

### Muscles

Examine the muscles for wasting and fasciculations; on the dorsal surface look for wasting, particularly of dorsal interossei. On the palm look particularly at the thenar and hypothenar eminences.
- Thenar wasting (fig 2.37) = median nerve lesion.
- Generalized wasting, particularly of the interossei on the dorsum, but sparing of the thenar eminence = ulnar nerve lesion.

Also look for Dupuytren's contracture and perform Tinel's test (percuss over the distal skin crease of the wrist). Phalen's test (patient holds dorsal surfaces of both hands together for 60 seconds). Both tests are positive if tingling reported, suggesting carpal tunnel syndrome.
