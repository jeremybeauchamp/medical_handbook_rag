# Electrolyte physiology and the kidney

## The kidney
Controls the homeostasis of a number of serum electrolytes (including Na+, K+, Ca2+, and PO43-), helps to maintain acid-base balance, and is responsible for the excretion of many substances. It also makes erythropoietin and renin, and hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (see p676 for Ca2+ and PO43- physiology). All of these functions can be affected in chronic kidney disease (p302), but it is the biochemical effects of kidney failure that are used to monitor disease progression.

## The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
Plasma is filtered by the glomeruli, and Na+, K+, H+, and water are reabsorbed from this filtrate under the control of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus (fig 7.13, p316) in response to low renal flow and raised sympathetic tone, and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen (a peptide made by the liver) to angiotensin I. This is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is located throughout the vascular tree, to angiotensin II. The latter has several important actions including efferent renal arteriolar constriction (thus ↑perfusion pressure), peripheral vasoconstriction, and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, which activates the Na+/K+ pump in the distal renal tubule leading to reabsorption of Na+ and water from the urine, in exchange for K+ and H+. Glucose spills over into the urine when the plasma concentration > renal threshold for reabsorption (≈10mmol/L, but this varies between people, and is ↓ in pregnancy).

## Control of sodium
Control is through the action of aldosterone on the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct to increase Na+ reabsorption from the urine. The natriuretic peptides ANP, BNP, and CNP (p137) contribute to Na+ homeostasis by reducing Na+ reabsorption from the DCT and inhibiting renin. A high GFR (see later in this topic) results in increased Na+ loss, and high renal tubular flow and haemodilution decrease Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

## Control of potassium
Most K+ is intracellular, and thus serum K+ levels are a poor reflection of total body potassium. The concentrations of K+ and H+ in extracellular fluid tend to vary together. This is because these ions compete with each other in the exchange with Na+ that occurs across most cell membranes and in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney, where Na+ is reabsorbed from the urine. Thus, if the H+ concentration is high, less K+ will be excreted into the urine. Similarly, K+ will compete with H+ for exchange across cell membranes and extracellular K+ will accumulate. Insulin and catecholamines both stimulate K+ uptake into cells by stimulating the Na+/K+ pump.

## Serum osmolality
A laboratory measurement of the number of osmoles per kilogram of solvent. It is approximated by serum osmolarity (the number of osmoles per litre of solution) using the equation 2(Na+ + K+) + Urea + Glucose, since these are the predominant serum electrolytes. Normal serum osmolarity is 280-300mmol/L, which will always be a little less than the laboratory-measured osmolality—the osmolar gap. However, if the osmolar gap is greater than 10mmol/L, this indicates the presence of additional solutes: consider diabetes mellitus or high blood ethanol, methanol, mannitol, or ethylene glycol.

## Control of water
Control is mainly via serum Na+ concentration, since water intake and loss are regulated to hold the extracellular concentration of Na+ constant. Raised plasma osmolality (eg dehydration or ↑glucose in diabetes mellitus) causes thirst through the hypothalamic thirst centre and the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. ADH increases the passive water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct by opening water channels to allow water to flow from the hypotonic luminal fluid into the hypertonic renal interstitium. Low plasma osmolality inhibits ADH secretion, thus reducing renal water reabsorption.

## Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
Defined as the volume of fluid filtered by the glomeruli per minute (units mL/min), and is one of the primary measures of disease progression in chronic kidney disease. It can be estimated in a number of different ways (see BOX).
