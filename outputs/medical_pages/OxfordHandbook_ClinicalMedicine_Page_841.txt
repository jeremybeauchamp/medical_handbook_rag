# Management of convulsive status epilepticus

1. Open and secure the airway (adjuncts as necessary)
   Remove false teeth if poorly fitting

2. Oxygen, 100% + suction (as required)

3. IV access and take blood:
   U&E, LFT, FBC, glucose, Ca2+
   Toxicology screen if indicated
   Anticonvulsant levels

4. IV bolusâ€”to stop seizures: eg lorazepam 4mg
   Give 2nd dose of lorazepam if no response after 10-20min

5. Thiamine 250mg IV over 30min if alcoholism or
   malnourishment suspected
   Glucose 50mL 50% IV, unless glucose known to be normal
   Treat acidosis if severe (contact ICU)

6. Correct hypotension with fluids

7. IV infusion: If seizures continue, start phenytoin,
   15-18mg/kg IVI, at a rate of 50mg/min. Monitor ECG and BP.
   100mg/6-8h is a maintenance dose (check levels)

8. General anaesthesia: Continuing seizures after 60-90mins of above
   therapies require expert help with paralysis (eg propofol infusion) and
   ventilation with continuous EEG monitoring in ICU. NB: never spend longer
   than 20min on someone with status epilepticus without having help at the
   bedside from an anaesthetist
