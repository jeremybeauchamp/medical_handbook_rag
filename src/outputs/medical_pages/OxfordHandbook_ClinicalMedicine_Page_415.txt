## Complicating comorbidity

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of CVD in HIV. Includes individuals where risk traditionally lower: younger age, normotensive, no DM, non-obese. Contributing factors: dyslipidaemia caused by ART, acceleration of pro-atherosclerotic inflammatory processes by HIV. Management of CV risk factors although no outcome data to guide specific lipid and BP targets in HIV.
- **Bone disease**: Increased risk of low bone-mineral density and fragility fractures in HIV. Contributing factors: side effect of ART, increased prevalence of risk factors, eg poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol, low vitamin D levels. Risk assess and consider bisphosphonate.
- **TB**: All patients with TB and HIV need ART (as soon as TB treatment tolerated and within 2 weeks if CD4 <100 cells/microlitre). Seek expert advice and refer to local guidelines. Consider Truvada® plus efavirenz as 1st line in UK (serum levels of integrase inhibitors are decreased by rifampicin). See ART, pp402-3, TB, pp394-5.
- **Hepatitis B (HBV)**: Co-infection requires an ART regimen including antivirals with anti-HBV activity, eg tenofovir plus emtricitabine (not lamivudine or emtricitabine as a single agent due to potential for emergence of HBV resistance).
- **Hepatitis C (HCV)**: Assess all with HIV for HCV treatment. Pegylated interferon efficacy is less with lower CD4 count. Aim for CD4 >500 cells/microlitre with ART first.

### Table 9.11 Differential diagnoses in HIV

| Presentation | Differential diagnosis |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Fever | Intraoral abscess, sinusitis, pneumonia, TB, endocarditis, meningitis, encephalitis, pyomyositis, lymphoma, immune-reconstitution after commencement of ART, any non-HIV cause. |
| Lymphadenopathy | Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (p399), TB, syphilis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcus, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, local infection. |
| Rash | Drug reaction, herpes zoster, scabies, cutaneous cryptococcus or histoplasmosis, Kaposi's sarcoma, seborrhoeic dermatitis. |
| Cough/SOB | Community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, TB, bronchial compression (TB, lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma), pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (uncommon), cardiac failure (HIV cardiomyopathy, infective pericardial effusion, HIV vasculopathy). |
| Diarrhoea | Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium difficile, amoebiasis, Giardia, Cryptosporidia, CMV, HIV enteropathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. |
| Abdominal pain | TB, CMV colitis, pancreatitis (CMV, TB or secondary to ART).<br>▶Do not forget a pregnancy test. |
| Dysphagia | Candidiasis, HSV. |
| ↑Liver enzymes | Viral hepatitis (A, B, C, CMV, HSV, EBV), drug-induced liver injury (anti-TB or ART), HIV cholangiopathy, lymphoma, congestion due to cardiac disease (pericardial effusion?). |
| AKI | Pre-renal due to sepsis/dehydration, interstitial nephritis secondary to medication, HIV-associated nephropathy (proteinuria, CKD). |
| Headache/ seizures/focal neurology | Meningitis (bacterial, TB, cryptococcal, syphilis), empyema, space-occupying lesion (toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, tuberculoma), adverse drug reaction, HIV encephalopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), stroke (HIV vasculopathy). See p517. |
| Eye disease | Herpes zoster, CMV retinitis. See pp438-9. |
| Peripheral neuropathy | ART, CMV, HIV neuropathy, nutritional deficiency. |
