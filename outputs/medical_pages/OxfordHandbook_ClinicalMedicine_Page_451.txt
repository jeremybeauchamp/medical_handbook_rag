## Rabies

Rhabdovirus transmitted through saliva or CNS tissue, usually from the bite of an infected mammal, eg bat (in UK), dog (95% of transmissions to humans), cat, fox. Disease is fatal once symptoms appear. Worldwide distribution. ~50 000 deaths/yr, most in Africa/Asia. 

**Presentation:** Incubation ~9-90d. Prodrome: headache, malaise, odd behaviour, agitation, fever, paraesthesia at bite/wound site. Progresses to one of two disease forms:
- 'Furious rabies': hyperactivity and terror (hydrophobia, aerophobia)
- 'Paralytic rabies': flaccid paralysis in the bitten limb→coma→death.

**Diagnosis:** Clinical: potential exposure + signs of myelitis/encephalitis (non-progressive disease and disease >3wk are negative indicators). Viral PCR (saliva, brain, nerve tissue) or CSF antibodies may offer later (post-mortem) confirmation. 

**Treatment:** If bitten, or lick to broken skin, wash (>15min) with soap and seek urgent help. Post-exposure prophylaxis: vaccination ± rabies immunoglobulin. Experimental treatments: ribavirin, interferon alfa, ketamine. Preventable and elimination feasible with pre-exposure vaccination of all at risk. Vaccination of dogs can ↓ human cases.

## Japanese encephalitis virus

Flavivirus spread by mosquitoes. Endemic transmission (~3 billion at risk) and common cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and west Pacific. Severe disease is rare (1 in 250) but leads to neurological or psychiatric sequelae in up to 50%, mortality up to 30%. 

**Presentation:** Incubation 5-15d. Most asymptomatic, or mild fever and headache only. Severe disease: high fever, headache, meningism, altered mental status, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, death. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical in endemic area. Serum/CSF serology, PCR.

**Treatment:** Supportive. Vaccination.

## West Nile virus

Mosquito-borne flavivirus with transmission in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Australia, and Americas. 

**Presentation:** Incubation 2-14d. Asymptomatic in ~80%. West Nile fever in ~20%: fever, headache, N&V, lymphadenopathy. Neuroinvasive in ~1%: encephalitis, meningitis, flaccid paralysis, mortality ~10%. 

**Diagnosis:** Serum/CSF IgM, viral PCR. 

**Treatment:** Supportive. Vaccine awaited (2016).

## Neurocysticercosis

Most common helminthic disease of the CNS and most frequent cause of preventable epilepsy (~50% of epilepsy in endemic areas, fig 9.46). Caused by pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Consumption of infected pork leads to intestinal infection (taeniasis) and the shedding of T. solium eggs in stool. Invasive disease occurs when the shed eggs are ingested via faeco-oral transmission. Neurocysticercosis is due to larval cysts infecting the CNS. 

**Presentation:** Determined by site and number of lesions (cysticerci) within the brain/spinal cord. Epilepsy in 70%. Focal neurology in ~20%: motor/sensory loss, language disturbance, involuntary movements. Also headache, visual loss, meningitis, hydrocephalus, cognitive impairment.

**Diagnosis:** CT/MRI imaging plus serology. 

**Treatment:** Seizure control (evidence on drug choice, length of treatment or prophylaxis). Neurosurgical advice if hydrocephalus/↑ICP. Albendazole for non-calcified lesions (better penetration of CNS than praziquantel). Beware inflammatory response provoked by treatment—consider dexamethasone.
