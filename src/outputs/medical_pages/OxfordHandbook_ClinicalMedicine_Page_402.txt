# Gram-positive bacteria

## Gram-positive cocci

### Staphylococci:
Staphylococci are skin/nasal commensals in ~80% of adults. They can also cause infectious disease. This produces a diagnostic challenge: are the detected organisms causing infection or a contaminating commensal? The answer may lie in the presence or absence of coagulase, an enzyme which coagulates plasma.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci: eg Staphylococcus epidermidis are less virulent. Pathogenicity is likely only if there is underlying immune system dysfunction or foreign material (prosthetic valve/joint, IV line, PD catheter, pacemaker).

Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase positive. Presentation:
1. Toxin release causes disease distant from infection. Includes:
   - scalded skin syndrome—bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins (no mucosal disease, ↓skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis)
   - preformed toxin in food—sudden D&V (p428)
   - toxic shock—fever, confusion, rash, diarrhoea, ↓BP, AKI, multiorgan dysfunction. Tampon associated or occurs with (minor) local infection.
2. Local tissue destruction: impetigo, cellulitis, mastitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, abscess, pneumonia, UTI.
3. Haematogenous spread: bacteraemia, endocarditis, 'metastatic' seeding.

Diagnosis: positive culture from relevant site of infection. Treatment: ▶▶Sepsis, see p792. Drain infected foci, antibiotic (topical/oral/IV) based on illness severity and risk factors. Consider local epidemiology of resistance. If systemic treatment indicated, use β-lactam whenever possible (may need to cover resistant strains until sensitivity available). Preformed toxin in food: supportive, antibiotics not usually indicated.

### Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: MRSA, VISA, VRSA

Staph. aureus which produces β-lactamase, or an altered enzyme responsible for cell wall formation, will be resistant to β-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, see p385). Resistance is usually defined by stability to meticillin, ie meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin resistance also exists and is classified according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit bacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA). Resistant staphylococci cause ↑ morbidity and mortality compared to sensitive strains. Risk factors for colonization include: antibiotic exposure, hospital stay, surgery, nursing home residence. Treatment of infection (not colonization): vancomycin (for MRSA), teicoplanin. Oral agents with activity against MRSA include clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, linezolid. Prevention: surveillance, barrier precautions, hand-hygiene, decolonization (mupirocin 2%, chlorhexidine, tea tree oil), antimicrobial stewardship. See p384, pp410–11.

### Streptococci:
Classification based on Lancefield group persists in terminology (fig 9.5). Includes:
- Streptococcus pyogenes (β-haemolytic group A): colonizes throat, skin, anogenital tract. Range of infection: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, pneumonia, peripartum sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis. All can→streptococcal toxic shock = sudden-onset ↓BP, multiorgan failure. Post-infectious complications rare: rheumatic fever (p142), glomerulonephritis (p310). Treatment: penicillin.
- Streptococcus agalactiae (β-haemolytic group B): neonatal and peurperal infection, skin, soft tissue. Invasive disease (bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: DM, malignancy, chronic disease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol.
- Streptococcus milleri: if found in blood culture look for an abscess—mouth, liver, lung, brain. Treatment: penicillin.
- Streptococcus pneumoniae: pneumonia (pp166–8), otitis media, meningitis, septicaemia. Treatment: penicillin. Vaccination: childhood, hyposplenism, >65y (p407).
- Viridans streptococci: commonest cause of oral/dental origin endocarditis (p150).
- Streptococcus bovis: bacteraemia→endocarditis. Look for colon/liver disease.
