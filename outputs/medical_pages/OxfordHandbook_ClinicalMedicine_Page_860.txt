# 846 Burns

## Assessment
Burn size is important to assess as it influences the size of the inflammatory response (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability) and thus fluid shift from the intravascular volume. Use Lund and Browder charts (see fig 19.27) or the 'rule of nines' (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk 18%; perineum 1%). Ignore erythema. Burn depth determines healing time/scarring; assessing this can be hard, even for the experienced. The big distinction is whether the burn is partial thickness (painful, red, and blistered) or full thickness (insensate/painless; grey-white). NB: burns can evolve, particularly over the first 48h.

## Resuscitation
Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major burns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and depth of burn (fig 19.27, to help calculate fluid requirements). Referral is still warranted in cases of full thickness burns >5%, partial thickness burns >10% in adults or >5% in children or the elderly, burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns, and burns with inhalational injury.

- **Airway:** Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if hot gases inhaled. Suspect if history of fire in enclosed space, soot in oral/nasal cavity, singed nasal hairs or hoarse voice. A flexible laryngo/bronchoscopy is useful. Involve anaesthetists early and consider early intubation. Obstruction can develop in the first 24h.

- **Breathing:** Exclude life-threatening chest injuries (eg tension pneumothorax) and constricting burns—consider escharotomy if chest burns are impairing thorax excursion (OHCS p766). Give 100% O₂. Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning (p842) from history, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhaemoglobin level (COHb). With 100% O₂ t½ of COHb falls from 250min to 40min (consider hyperbaric O₂ if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; >25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO₂ (oximetry) is unreliable in CO poisoning.

- **Circulation:** Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require IV fluid resuscitation. Put up 2 large-bore (14G or 16G) IV lines. Do not worry if you have to put these through burned skin; intraosseous access is valuable in infants and can be used in adults (see OHCS p236). Secure them well: they are literally lifelines.

Use a burns calculator flow chart or a formula, eg: Parkland formula (popular): 4 × weight (kg) × % burn = mL Hartmann's solution in 24h, half given in 1st 8h. Replace fluid from the time of burn, not from the time first seen in hospital. Formulae are only guides: adjust IVI according to clinical response and urine output; aim for 0.5mL/kg/h (1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury. Monitor T° (core and surface); catheterize the bladder. Beware of over-resuscitation ('fluid creep') which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.

## Treatment
'Cool the burn, warm the patient.' Do not apply cold water to extensive burns for long periods: this may intensify shock. Take care with circumferential full-thickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particularly after fluid resuscitation. Decompress (escharotomy and fasciotomy) as needed. If transferring to a burns unit, do not burst blisters or apply any special creams as this can hinder assessment. Simple saline gauze or paraffin gauze is suitable; cling film is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. Titrate morphine IV for good analgesia. Ensure tetanus immunity. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used.

## Definitive dressings
There are many dressings for partial thickness burns, eg biological (pigskin, cadaveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadiazine cream alone or with cerium nitrate as Flammacerium®; it forms a leathery eschar which resists infection. Major full-thickness burns benefit from early tangential excision and split-skin grafts as the burn is a major source of inflammatory cytokines and forms a rich medium for bacterial growth.
