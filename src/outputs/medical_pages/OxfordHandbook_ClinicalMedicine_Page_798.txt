# 784 Chest pain: differential diagnosis

First exclude any potentially life-threatening causes, by virtue of history, brief examination, and limited investigations. Then consider other potential causes. For the full assessment of cardiac pain, see pp94, 118.

## Life-threatening
- Acute myocardial infarction (pp796-9).
- Angina/acute coronary syndrome (pp796-9).
- Aortic dissection (p655).
- Tension pneumothorax (p814).
- Pulmonary embolism (p818).
- Oesophageal rupture (p820).

## Others
- Pneumonia (p816).
- Chest wall pain:
  - Muscular.
  - Rib fractures.
  - Bony metastases.
  - Costochondritis.
- Gastro-oesophageal reflux (p254).
- Pleurisy (p166).
- Empyema (p170).
- Pericarditis (p154).
- Oesophageal spasm (p250).
- Herpes zoster (p404).
- Cervical spondylosis (p508).
- Intra-abdominal:
  - Cholecystitis (p634).
  - Peptic ulceration (p252).
  - Pancreatitis (p270).
- Sickle-cell crisis (p340).

Before discharging patients with undiagnosed chest pain, be sure in your own mind that the pain is not cardiac (this pain is usually dull, may radiate to jaw, arm, or epigastrium, and is usually associated with exertion). Carry out key investigations and discuss options with a colleague, and the patient. Safety-net, telling the patient to return or seek advice if they develop worrying features (specify these) or the pain does not settle.

## Key investigations
- CXR.
- ECG.
- FBC, U&E, and troponin (p118). Consider D-dimer only if low probability of venous thromboembolism. See 'Modified Wells' score for PE, p191.

Just because the patient's chest wall is tender to palpation, this doesn't mean the cause of the chest pain is musculoskeletal. Even if palpation reproduces the same type of pain, ensure that you exclude all potential life-threatening causes. Although chest wall tenderness has discriminatory value against cardiac pain, it may be a feature of a pulmonary embolism.
