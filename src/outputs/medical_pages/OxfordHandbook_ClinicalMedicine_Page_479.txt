# Bittersweet symphony

German composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) began to lose his hearing from his early 30s—first high-frequency sounds were lost, associated with debilitating tinnitus: 'My ears sing and buzz continually, day and night. I can truly say that I am living a wretched life...in my profession it is a frightful state.' However, despite becoming profoundly deaf by the age of 44, he continued to compose and perform throughout his auditory decline. As deafness crept into the ears of the French composer, Gabriel Fauré (1845-1924), he composed less, but only after losing his hearing did he manage to overcome his previous fear of writing a string quartet, telling his wife 'This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made famous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrified of it'. They are not the only masters of their field to overcome auditory impairment; so did cardiologist Helen Taussig (see p92).
