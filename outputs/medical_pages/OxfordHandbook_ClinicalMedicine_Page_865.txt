# Blast injuries

These may be caused by domestic (eg gas explosion) or industrial (eg mining) accidents, or by terrorist bombs. Death may occur without any obvious external injury. Injury occurs in a number of ways:

1. **Blast wave:** A transient (milliseconds) wave of overpressure expands rapidly producing cellular disruption, shearing forces along tissue planes (submucosal/subserosal haemorrhage) and re-expansion of compressed trapped gasâ€”bowel perforation, fatal air embolism.

2. **Blast wind:** This can totally disrupt a body or cause avulsive amputations. Bodies can be thrown and sustain injuries on landing.

3. **Missiles:** Penetration or laceration from missiles are by far the commonest injuries. Missiles arise from the bomb or are secondary, eg glass.

4. **Flash burns:** These are usually superficial and occur on exposed skin.

5. **Crush injuries:** Beware sudden death or acute kidney injury from rhabdomyolysis after release.

6. **Contamination:** There is increasing concern about the use of biological or radioactive material in terrorist bombs. Even domestic or industrial blasts can scatter chemicals widely and cause both superficial and penetrating contamination. Consider the location and mechanism of the blast, and seek advice.

7. **Psychological injury:** Eg post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353).

**Treatment:** Approach the same as any major trauma (OHCS p778). Rest and observe any suspected of exposure to significant blast but without other injury.

**Gun-shot injury:** see OHCS p789. Major blast injuries, whatever the cause, should be reported to the police for investigation.
