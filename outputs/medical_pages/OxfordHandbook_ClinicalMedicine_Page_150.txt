## Heart failure—management

### Acute heart failure
This is a medical emergency (p800).

### Chronic heart failure
Stop smoking. Stop drinking alcohol. Eat less salt. Optimize weight & nutrition.33

- Treat the cause (eg if dysrhythmias; valve disease).
- Treat exacerbating factors (anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, TBP).
- Avoid exacerbating factors, eg NSAIDs (fluid retention) and verapamil (-ve inotrope).
- Annual 'flu vaccine, one-off pneumococcal vaccine.
- Drugs:

1. **Diuretics**: Give loop diuretics to relieve symptoms, eg furosemide 40mg/24h PO or bumetanide 1-2mg/24h PO. Increase dose as necessary. SE: K+, renal impairment. Monitor U&E and add K+-sparing diuretic (eg spironolactone) if K+ <3.2mmol/L, predisposition to arrhythmias, concurrent digoxin therapy, or pre-existing K+-losing conditions. If refractory oedema, consider adding a thiazide, eg metolazone 5-20mg/24h PO. Diuretics improve symptoms but studies showing mortality benefit are lacking.

2. **ACE-i**: Consider in all those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD); improves symptoms and prolongs life (see p114-5). If cough is a problem, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be substituted. SE: ↑K+.

3. **β-blockers**: (eg carvedilol) ↓mortality in heart failure—benefit additional to those of ACE-i in patients with systolic dysfunction.38 Use with caution: 'start low and go slow'; if in doubt seek specialist advice first; wait ≥2weeks between each dose increment. β-blocker therapy in patients hospitalized with decompensated heart failure is associated with lower post-discharge mortality risk and improved treatment rates.39

4. **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Spironolactone (25mg/24h PO) ↓mortality by 30% when added to conventional therapy.40 Use in those still symptomatic despite optimal therapy as listed previously, and in post-MI patients with LVSD. Spironolactone is K+-sparing, but there is little risk of significant hyperkalaemia, even when given with ACE-i. Nevertheless, U&E should be monitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alternative if spironolactone is not tolerated.

5. **Digoxin**: Helps symptoms even in those with sinus rhythm, and should be considered for patients with LVSD who have signs or symptoms of heart failure while receiving standard therapy, including ACE-i and β-blockers, or in patients with AF. Dose example: 125mcg/24h PO if sinus rhythm. Monitor U&E; maintain K+ at 4-5mmol/L as ↓K+ risks digoxin toxicity, and vice versa. Digoxin levels: p756. Other inotropes are unhelpful in terms of outcome.

6. **Vasodilators**: The combination of hydralazine (SE: drug-induced lupus) and isosorbide dinitrate should be used if intolerant of ACE-i and ARBs as it reduces mortality. It also reduces mortality when added to standard therapy (including ACE-i) in black patients with heart failure.41

### Intractable heart failure
Reassess the cause. Are they taking the drugs?—at maximum dose? Switching furosemide to bumetanide (one 5mg tab≈200mg furosemide) might help. Inpatient management may include:

- Minimal exertion; Na+ & fluid restriction (1.5L/24h PO).
- Metolazone (as above) and IV furosemide (p800).
- Opiates and IV nitrates may relieve symptoms (p800).
- Weigh daily. Do frequent U&E (beware ↓K+).
- Give DVT prophylaxis: heparin + TED stockings (p578).

**In extremis**: Try IV inotropes (p802; it may be difficult to wean patients off them).

**Consider**: Cardiac resynchronization (p132), LV assist device (BOX 'Pulseless patients'), or transplantation.

### Palliative care
Treat/prevent comorbidities (eg 'flu vaccination). Good nutrition (allow alcohol!). Involve GP: continuity of care and discussion of prognosis is much appreciated.42 Dyspnoea, pain (from liver capsule stretching), nausea, constipation, and mood all need tackling.43 Opiates improve pain and dyspnoea. O2 may help.
