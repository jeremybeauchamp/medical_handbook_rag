# ABG interpretation

Normal pH is 7.35-7.45. pH <7.35 indicates acidosis and >7.45 indicates alkalosis.
If the pCO2 is in keeping with the pH, the problem is likely to be a respiratory
problem (eg high pCO2 and pH <7.35 = likely a respiratory acidosis). If the HCO3-
is in keeping with the pH, this is suggestive of a metabolic problem (eg high
HCO3- and pH > 7.45 = metabolic alkalosis).

## Table 4.7 Interpreting blood gas analysis

| | pH | PaCO2 | HCO3- |
|------------------|------|------------|------------|
| Metabolic acidosis | Low | Normal/low | Low |
| Respiratory acidosis | Low | High | Normal/high |
| Metabolic alkalosis | High | Normal/high | High |
| Respiratory alkalosis | High | Low | Normal/low |

## Steps to ABG interpretation:
1. pH: acidosis or alkalosis?
2. pCO2: high/low? Does this fit with the pH? (if yes, think respiratory problem)
3. HCO3-: high/low? Does this fit with pH? (if yes, think metabolic problem)
4. PO2: is this normal given the FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen)?
5. Is there any compensation? (i.e. changes in PCO2/HCO3- to try and correct an underlying imbalance). Is this partial (pH abnormal) or complete (pH normalized)?
6. Calculate the anion gap. Helpful in working out aetiology of metabolic acidosis.

Anion gap: (Na+ + K+) - (Cl- + HCO3-)

See p670 for causes of raised anion gap (normal 10-18mmol/L).

# Administering oxygen

Oxygen should be prescribed. Titrate the amount guided by the patient's SaO2 and
clinical condition. Humidification is only required for longer-term delivery of O2 at
high flow rates and tracheostomies, but may ↑ expectoration in bronchiectasis.

**Nasal cannulae:** Preferred by patients, but O2 delivery is relatively imprecise and
may cause nasal soreness. The flow rate (1-4L/min) roughly defines the concentration of O2 (24-40%). May be used to maintain SaO2 when nebulizers need to be run
using air, eg COPD.

**Simple face mask:** Delivers a variable amount of O2 depending on the rate of
inflow. Less precise than venturi masks—so don't use if hypercapnia or type II
respiratory failure. Risk of CO2 accumulation (within the mask and so in inspired
gas) if flow rate <5L/min. ▸Be careful in those with COPD (p812).

**Venturi mask:** Provides a precise percentage or fraction of O2 (FiO2) at high flow
rates. Start at 24-28% in COPD. Colours of masks:

BLUE = 24%, WHITE = 28%, YELLOW = 35%, RED = 40%, GREEN = 60%.

**Non-rebreathing mask:** These have a reservoir bag and deliver high concentrations of O2 (60-90%), determined by the inflow (10-15L/min) and the presence of
flap valves on the side. They are commonly used in emergencies, but are imprecise
and should be avoided in those requiring controlled O2 therapy.

**Promoting oxygenation:** Other ways to ↑ oxygenation to reach the target SaO2
(this should be given as a number on the drug chart):
• Treat anaemia (transfuse if essential).
• Improve cardiac output (treat heart failure).
• Chest physio to improve ventilation/perfusion mismatch.
