## Percussion

Confirm the lower border and define the upper border of the liver and spleen (dull in the mid-axillary line in the 10th intercostal space). Percuss all regions of abdomen. If this induces pain, there may be peritoneal inflammation below (eg an inflamed appendix). Some experts percuss first, before palpation, because even anxious patients do not expect this to hurt—so, if it does hurt, this is a very valuable sign. Percuss for the shifting dullness of ascites (p61 & p604) but ultrasound is a more reliable way of detecting ascites.

## Auscultation

Bowel sounds: absence implies ileus; they are enhanced and tinkling in bowel obstruction. Listen for bruits in the aorta, renal and femoral arteries.

## Further examination 
Check for hernias (p612), perform a PR examination see BOX 'Examination of the rectum and anus'.

### Examination of the rectum and anus

- It is necessary to have a chaperone present for the examination. Explain what you are about to do. Make sure curtains are pulled. Have the patient lie on their left side, with knees brought up towards the chest. Use gloves and lubricant. Part the buttocks and inspect the anus: 
  - A gaping anus suggests a neuropathy or megarectum. 
  - Symmetry (a tender unilateral bulge suggests an abscess). 
  - Prolapsed piles. 
  - A subanodermal clot may peep out. 
  - Prolapsed rectum (descent of >3cm when asked to strain, as if to pass a motion). 
  - Anodermatitis (from frequent soiling). 
- The anocutaneous reflex tests sensory and motor innervation—on lightly stroking the anal skin, does the external sphincter briefly contract?

Press your index finger against the side of the anus. Ask the patient to breathe deeply and insert your finger slowly. Feel for masses (haemorrhoids are not palpable) or impacted stool. Twist your arm so that the pad of your finger is feeling anteriorly. Feel for the cervix or prostate. Note consistency, size, and symmetry of the prostate. If there is faecal incontinence or concern about the spinal cord, ask the patient to squeeze your finger and note the tone. This is best done with your finger pad facing posteriorly. Note stool or blood on the glove and test for occult blood.

Wipe the anus. Consider proctoscopy (for the anus) or sigmoidoscopy (which mainly inspects the rectum).

### Causes of hepatomegaly

(For hepatosplenomegaly, see p604.)

- Malignancy: Metastatic or primary (usually craggy, irregular edge).
- Hepatic congestion: Right heart failure—may be pulsatile in tricuspid incompetence, hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome, p696).
- Anatomical: Riedel's lobe (normal variant).
- Infection: Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis viruses, malaria, schistosomiasis, amoebic abscess, hydatid cyst.
- Haematological: Leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders (eg myelofibrosis), sickle-cell disease, haemolytic anaemias.
- Others: Fatty liver, porphyria, amyloidosis, glycogen storage disorders.

### Splenomegaly

- Abnormally large spleen.
- Causes: See p604. If massive, think of: chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis, malaria (or leishmaniasis).

### Features of the spleen differentiating it from an enlarged kidney

- Cannot get above it (ribs overlie the upper border of the spleen).
- Dull to percussion (kidney is usually resonant because of overlying bowel).
- Moves towards RIF with inspiration (kidney tends to move downwards).
- May have palpable notch on its medial side.
