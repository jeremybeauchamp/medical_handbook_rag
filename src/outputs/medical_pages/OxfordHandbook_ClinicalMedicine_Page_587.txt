Fig 13.4 Principles of anaesthesia.

The conduct of anaesthesia (fig 13.4) typically involves:

- **Induction**: Either intravenous (eg propofol 1.5-2.5mg/kg IV at a rate of 20-40mg every 10s; thiopental is an alternative) or, if airway obstruction or difficult IV access, gaseous (eg sevoflurane or nitrous oxide, mixed in O2).
- **Airway control**: Either using a facemask, an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway or by intubation. The latter usually requires muscle relaxation with a depolarizing/non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (OHCS p622).
- **Maintenance of anaesthesia**: Either a volatile agent added to N2O/O2 mixture, or high-dose opiates with mechanical ventilation, or IV infusion anaesthesia (eg propofol 4-12mg/kg/h IVI).
- **Recovery**: Change inspired gases to 100% oxygen only, then discontinue any anaesthetic infusions and reverse muscle paralysis. Extubate once spontaneously breathing, place patient in recovery position, and give oxygen by facemask.
- For further details, see the Anaesthesia chapter in OHCS (p612).

## Local anaesthetic toxicity and maximum doses

Anaesthetists are masters of the drug dose by weight! It is important to remember the maximum doses for local anaesthetics, not least because we use them so frequently, but because the effects of overdose can be lethal.

Handy to remember (though it can be worked out with a pen, paper, and SI units) is that a 1% concentration is equivalent to 10mg/mL. Local anaesthetics are also basic, and so do not work well in acidic environments, eg abscesses.

| % concn | Lidocaine concn (mg/mL) | Approx. allowable volume (mL/kg) | Approx. allowable volume for 70kg adult (mL) |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 0.25%   | 2.5                     | 1.12                             | ≤80                                         |

Local anaesthetic toxicity starts with peri-oral tingling and paraesthesiae, progressing to drowsiness, seizures, coma, and cardiorespiratory arrest. If suspected (the patient feels 'funny' and develops early signs) then stop administration immediately and commence ABC resuscitation as required. Treatment is with lipid emulsion.
