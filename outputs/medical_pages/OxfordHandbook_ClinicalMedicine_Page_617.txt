# Breast lump

## 'Triple assessment'

1. Clinical examination
2. Radiology: ultrasound for <35yrs; mammography and ultrasound for >35yrs old*
3. Histology/cytology (FNA or core biopsy: US-guided core biopsy is best for new lumps)

| Cystic lump | Solid lump |
|-------------|------------|
| →aspirate   | →core biopsy |

| Residual mass | Clear fluid | Malignant | Clear fluid |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| →core biopsy   | →discard fluid and reassure | →plan ℞ | →discard fluid and reassure |

| Bloody fluid |
|--------------|
| →cytology    |

Reassurance can be more emphatic if there is no family history and biopsy shows a non-proliferative lesion.

*US is more accurate at detecting invasive breast cancer, though mammography remains most accurate at detecting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). MRI is used in the assessment of multifocal/bilateral disease and patients with cosmetic implants who are identified as high risk.

## Sentinel node biopsy

Decreases needless axillary clearances in lymph node -ve patients.
- Patent blue dye and/or radiocolloid injected into periareolar area or tumour.
- A gamma probe/visual inspection is used to identify the sentinel node.
- The sentinel node is biopsied and sent for histology ± immunohistochemistry; further clearance only if sentinel node +ve.

Sentinel node identified in 90%. False -ve rates <5% for experienced surgeons.

## Prognostic factors in breast cancer

Tumour size, grade, lymph node status, ER/PR status, presence of vascular invasion all help assess prognosis. Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) is widely used to predict survival and risk of relapse, and to help select appropriate adjuvant systemic therapy. NPI = 0.2 × tumour size (cm) + histological grade + nodal status^6

If treated with surgery alone, 10yr survival rates are: NPI <2.4: 95%; NPI 2.4-3.4: 85%; NPI 3.4-4.4: 70%; NPI 4.4-5.4: 50%; NPI >5.4: 20%.

## Benign breast disease

**Fibroadenoma:** Usually presents <30yrs but can occur up to menopause. Benign overgrowth of collagenous mesenchyme of one breast lobule. Firm, smooth, mobile lump, the 'breast mouse'. Painless. May be multiple. ⅓ regress, ⅓ stay the same, ⅓ get bigger. ℞: observation and reassurance, but if in doubt refer for USS (usually conclusive) ± FNA. Surgical excision if large.

**Breast cysts:** Common >35yrs, esp. perimenopausal. Benign, fluid-filled rounded lump. Not fixed to surrounding tissue. Occasionally painful. ℞: diagnosis confirmed on aspiration (perform only if trained).

**Infective mastitis/breast abscesses:** Infection of mammary duct often associated with lactation (usually Staph. aureus). Abscess presents as painful, hot swelling of breast segment. ℞: antibiotics. Open incision or percutaneous drainage if abscess.

**Duct ectasia:** Typically around menopause. Ducts become blocked and secretions stagnate. Present with nipple discharge (green/brown/bloody) ± nipple retraction ± lump. Refer for confirmation of diagnosis. Usually no ℞ needed. Advise to stop smoking.

**Fat necrosis:** Fibrosis and calcification after injury to breast tissue. Scarring results in a firm lump. Refer for triple assessment. No ℞ once diagnosis confirmed.

^6 Nodal status is scored 1-3: 1 = node -ve; 2 = 1-3 nodes +ve; 3 = >3 nodes +ve for breast cancer. Histological grade is also scored 1-3.
