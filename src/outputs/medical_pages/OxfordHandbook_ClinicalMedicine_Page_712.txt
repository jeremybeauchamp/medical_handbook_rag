## Eponymous syndromes

### Devic's syndrome (Neuromyelitis optica; NMO.)
Inflammatory demyelination causes attacks of optic neuritis ± myelitis.* Abnormal CSF (may mimic bacterial meningitis) and serum anti-AQP4 antibody (in 65%) help distinguish it from MS* (table 15.1).
℞: IV steroids; plasma exchange. Azathioprine and rituximab* help prevent relapses.
Prognosis: Variable; complete remission may occur.

*Eugène Devic, 1858-1930 (French neurologist)*

### Dressler's syndrome
This develops 2-10wks after an MI, heart surgery (or even pacemaker insertion). It is thought that myocardial injury stimulates formation of autoantibodies against heart muscle. Symptoms: Recurrent fever and chest pain ± pleural or pericardial rub (from serositis). Cardiac tamponade may occur, so avoid anticoagulants. ℞: Aspirin, NSAIDs, or steroids.

*William Dressler, 1890-1969 (US cardiologist)*

### Dubin-Johnson syndrome
There is defective hepatocyte excretion of conjugated bilirubin. Typically presents in late teens with intermittent jaundice ± hepatosplenomegaly (autosomal recessive). Tests: ↑Bilirubin; ALT and AST are normal; bilirubinuria on dipstick; ↑ratio of urinary coproporphyrin I to III. Liver biopsy: diagnostic pigment granules.* ℞: Usually none needed.

*Isadore N Dubin, 1913-1981; Frank B Johnson, b1919 (US pathologists)*

### Dupuytren's contracture (fig 15.3)
Progressive shortening and thickening of the palmar fascia causing finger contracture and loss of extension (often 5th finger). Prevalence: ~10% of ♂>65yrs (↑ if +ve family history). Associations: Smoking, alcohol use, heavy manual labour, trauma, DM, phenytoin, HIV. Peyronie's may coexist (p708). It is thought to be caused by local hypoxia. ℞: Collagenase injections.* Surgery may be needed.

*Baron Guillaume Dupuytren, 1777-1835 (French surgeon, famed also for treating Napoleon's haemorrhoids)*

### Ekbom's syndrome (Restless legs.)
Criteria: 1 Compelling desire to move legs. 2 Worse at night. 3 Relieved by movement. 4 Unpleasant leg sensations (eg shootings or tinglings) worse at rest. Mechanism: Endogenous opioid system fault causes altered central processing of pain. Prevalence: 1-3%. ♀:♂≈2:1. Associations: Iron deficiency, uraemia, pregnancy, DM, polyneuropathy, RA, COPD. Exclude: Cramps, positional discomfort, and local leg pathology. ℞: Dopamine agonists are commonly used; also, anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines.*

*Karl Axel Ekbom, 1907-1977 (Swedish neurologist)*

### Fabry disease
X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by abnormalities in the GLA gene, leading to a deficiency in α-galactosidase A. There is accumulation of glycosphingolipids in skin (angiokeratoma classically in a 'swimming trunk' distribution), eyes (corneal verticillata), heart (hypertrophy, mitral valve prolapse, dilated aortic root, arrhythmias, angina), kidneys (renal failure, p320), CNS (stroke) and nerves (neuropathy/acroparaesthesia). Prior to enzyme replacement, premature death in the 6th decade was due to CV and renal disease. ℞: Enzyme replacement therapy with α or β human agalsidase.*

*Johannes Fabry, 1860-1930 (German dermatologist)*

### Fanconi anaemia
Autosomal recessive, defective stem cell repair & chromosomal fragility leads to aplastic anaemia, ↑risk of AML and breast ca (BRCA2), skin pigmentation, absent radii, short stature, microcephaly, syndactyly, deafness, ↓IQ, hypopituitarism, and cryptorchidism. ℞: Stem-cell transplant.

*Guido Fanconi, 1892-1979 (Swiss paediatrician)*

### Felty's syndrome
A triad of rheumatoid arthritis + ↓WCC + splenomegaly (±hypersplenism, causing anaemia and ↓platelets), recurrent infections, skin ulcers, and lymphadenopathy. 95% are Rh factor +ve. Splenectomy may raise the WCC. ℞: DMARDs (p547) ± rituximab if refractory.*

*Augustus Roi Felty, 1895-1964 (US physician)*

### Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome
Liver capsule inflammation causing RUQ pain due to transabdominal spread of chlamydial or gonococcal infection, often with PID ± 'violin-string' adhesions. ℞: Antibiotics for PID (+ treat sexual partners) ± laparoscopic division of adhesions.

*Thomas Fitz-Hugh, 1894-1963 (US physician); Arthur H Curtis, 1881-1955 (US gynaecologist)*

### Foster Kennedy syndrome
Optic atrophy of one eye due to optic nerve compression (most commonly from an olfactory groove meningioma), with papilloedema of the other eye secondary to ↑ICP. There is also central scotoma and anosmia.

*Robert Foster Kennedy, 1884-1952 (British neurologist)*

### Friedreich's ataxia
Expansions of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the frataxin gene (recessive) causes degeneration of many nerve tracts: spinocerebellar tracts degenerate causing cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus, and dysdiadochokinesis. Loss of corticospinal tracts occurs (weakness and extensor plantar response) with peripheral
