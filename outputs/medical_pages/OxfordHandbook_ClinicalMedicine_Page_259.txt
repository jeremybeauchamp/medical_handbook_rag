## Losing weight—why and how?

### The risks of too much sugar
Excess sugar causes caries, diabetes, obesity—which itself contributes to osteoarthritis, cancer, hypertension, and increased oxidative stress—so raising cardiovascular mortality and much more.

### Losing weight
Motivational therapy. Consider referral to a dietician—a needs-specific diet may be best. In conjunction with exercise and diet strategies, targeted weight-loss can also be achieved successfully with psychotherapy.

### Drugs or surgery for obesity?
The most desirable treatment for obesity is still primary prevention, but pharmacotherapy does work. Orlistat lowers fat absorption (hence SE of oily faecal incontinence)—see OHCS p514. Surgery: Carries potential for significant weight loss in appropriately selected patients but also significant morbidity (see p626).

## Calculating body mass index

Table 6.1 BMI=(weight in kg)/(height in m)²

| BMI    | State                  | Some implications within the categories                |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <18.5  | Underweight            | Consider pathology (inc. eating disorder)              |
| 18.5-25| On target              |                                                        |
| 25-30  | Overweight             | Weight loss should be considered                       |
| 30-40  | Obesity                | >32 is unsuitable for day-case general surgery         |
| >40    | Extreme/morbid obesity | >40 is an indication for bariatric surgery             |

Caveats: BMI does not take into account the distribution of body fat, and is harder to interpret for children and adolescents. Waist circumference >94cm in men and >80cm in women reflects omental fat and correlates better with risk than does BMI. BMI is still a valid way of comparing populations: average BMI in the USA is 28.8; in Japan, 22. A nation can be lean without being poor. As nations continue to adopt the lifestyle trends of the USA, this impacts sustainability.
