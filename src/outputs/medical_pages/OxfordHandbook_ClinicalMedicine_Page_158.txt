# Mitral valve disease

## Mitral regurgitation (MR)
Backflow through the mitral valve during systole.

**Causes:** Functional (LV dilatation); annular calcification (elderly); rheumatic fever; infective endocarditis; mitral valve prolapse; ruptured chordae tendinae; papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture (eg post-MI); connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan's); cardiomyopathy; congenital (may be associated with other defects, eg ASD, AV canal); appetite suppressants (eg fenfluramine, phentermine).

**Symptoms:** Dyspnoea; fatigue; palpitations; symptoms of causative factor (eg fever).

**Signs:** AF; displaced, hyperdynamic apex; pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla; soft S₁; split S₂; loud P₂ (pulmonary hypertension). Severity: the more severe, the larger the left ventricle.

**Tests:** 
- ECG: AF; P-mitrale if in sinus rhythm (may mean ↑left atrial size); LVH. 
- CXR: big LA & LV; mitral valve calcification; pulmonary oedema.

**Echocardiogram:** To assess LV function and MR severity and aetiology (transoesophageal to assess severity and suitability for repair rather than replacement). Cardiac catheterization to confirm diagnosis, exclude other valve disease, and assess coronary artery disease (can combine CABG with valve surgery).

**Management:** Control rate if fast AF. Anticoagulate if: AF; history of embolism; prosthetic valve; additional mitral stenosis. Diuretics improve symptoms. Surgery⁴ for deteriorating symptoms; aim to repair or replace the valve before LV is irreversibly impaired.

## Mitral valve prolapse
Is the most common valvular abnormality (prevalence: ~5%). Occurs alone or with: ASD, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Turner's syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, WPW (p133). 

**Symptoms:** Usually asymptomatic. May develop atypical chest pain, palpitations, and autonomic dysfunction symptoms. 

**Signs:** Mid-systolic click and/or a late systolic murmur. 

**Complications:** MR, cerebral emboli, arrhythmias, sudden death. 

**Tests:** Echo is diagnostic. ECG may show inferior T-wave inversion. ℞: β-blockers may help palpitations and chest pain. Surgery if severe MR.

## Mitral stenosis
**Causes:** Rheumatic fever, congenital, mucopolysaccharidoses, endocardial fibroelastosis, malignant carcinoid (p271; rare), prosthetic valve.

**Presentation:** Normal mitral valve orifice area is ~4–6cm². Symptoms usually begin when the orifice becomes <2cm². Pulmonary hypertension causes dyspnoea, haemoptysis, chronic bronchitis-like picture; pressure from large left atrium on local structures causes hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia (oesophagus), bronchial obstruction; also fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, systemic emboli, infective endocarditis (rare).

**Signs:** Malar flush on cheeks (due to ↓cardiac output); low-volume pulse; AF common (due to enlarged LA); tapping, non-displaced, apex beat (palpable S₁); RV heave. On auscultation: loud S₁; opening snap (pliable valve); rumbling mid-diastolic murmur (heard best in expiration, with patient on left side). Graham Steell murmur (p46) may occur. Severity: the more severe the stenosis, the longer the diastolic murmur, and the closer the opening snap is to S₂.

**Tests:** 
- ECG: AF; P-mitrale; RVH; progressive RAD. 
- CXR: left atrial enlargement (double shadow in right cardiac silhouette); pulmonary oedema; mitral valve calcification. 
- Echo is diagnostic. Significant stenosis exists if the valve orifice is <1cm²/m² body surface area. 

**Indications for cardiac catheterization:** previous valvotomy; signs of other valve disease; angina; severe pulmonary hypertension; calcified mitral valve.

**Management:** If in AF, rate control (p130) is crucial; anticoagulate with warfarin (p350). Diuretics ↓preload and pulmonary venous congestion. If this fails to control symptoms, balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calcified valve), open mitral valvotomy, or valve replacement.

⁴ In patients with severe symptoms for whom open surgery is too dangerous, consider transcatheter valve repair, eg with MitraClip®. This is only available in specialist centres.
