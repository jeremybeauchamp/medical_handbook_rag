Table 10.1 Major neurotransmitters and associated drugs

| Drugs increasing activity (≈agonists) | Drugs decreasing activity (≈antagonists) |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dopamine** Acts on receptors D1–5; affects mood and reward-seeking behaviour. |
| Pramipexole, ropinirole, levodopa, apomorphine (Parkinson's*) | Chlorpromazine (schizophrenia, OHCS p340) |
| Cabergoline (hyperprolactinaemia; acromegaly). | Metoclopramide (nausea) |
| | Inhibition of dopamine signalling may lead to drug induced parkinsonism. |
| **Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT)** Many receptor types 5HT1–7; multiple effects. |
| Lithium (mood stabilizer) | Ondansetron (nausea) |
| Sumatriptan (migraine) | Mirtazapine (depression) |
| Buspirone (partial agonist; anxiety) | Olanzapine, clozapine (schizophrenia) |
| Fluoxetine, sertraline (reuptake inhibitors; depression). | |
| **Amino acids** Glutamate and aspartate act as excitatory transmitters on NMDA and non-NMDA receptors—relevant in epilepsy and CNS ischaemia. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is mostly inhibitory. |
| Gabapentin, valproate (GABA agonists; epilepsy and neuropathic pain) | Memantine (glutamate antagonist; dementia) |
| Benzodiazepines (GABA agonists; sedation) | |
| Baclofen (GABA agonists; spasticity) | |
| Alcohol (GABA agonist)† | |
| **Acetylcholine** Multiple receptors classed into muscarinic and nicotinic types. Peripheral agonists used in glaucoma (pilocarpine); myasthenia (anticholinesterases). Peripheral antagonists used in asthma (ipratropium); incontinence; to dry secretions pre-op; to dilate pupils; to ↑ heart rate (atropine). Centrally acting drugs include: |
| Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; dementia) | Procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl (drug-induced parkinsonism) |
| **Histamine and purines** (eg ATP) | |
| | Cyclizine (antihistamine; nausea) |
| | Purinergic receptor blockers (emerging role in chronic pain). |
| **Neuropeptides** Multiple and growing list; includes opioids and substance P |
| Exogenous opioids (wide-ranging analgesic and mood-related effects). | Aprepitant (chemotherapy-related nausea by blocking substance P receptors). |
| **Noradrenaline, adrenaline (=norepinephrine, epinephrine)** 4 receptor types: α1–2, β1–2. Noradrenaline is more specific for α-receptors but both transmitters affect all receptors. In the periphery, α-receptors drive arteriolar vasoconstriction and pupillary dilation; β1 stimulation leads to ↑ pulse and myocardial contractility; β2 stimulation leads to bronchodilatation, uterine relaxation, and arteriolar vasodilation. Centrally acting drugs include: |
| Clonidine (refractory hypertension) | |
| Tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine (5HT and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; depression) | |
| MAOIs | |

*Agonism at D3 receptor agonists may cause pathological behavioural patterns, eg hypersexuality, pathological gambling or hobbying, and disorders of impulse control in people having no history of these.

†In chronic alcohol use, GABA receptors are downregulated; acamprosate, used in alcoholism, may help to maintain GABA signalling after alcohol withdrawal.
