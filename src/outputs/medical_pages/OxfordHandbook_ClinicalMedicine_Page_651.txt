# Modified Glasgow criteria for predicting severity of pancreatitis

Three or more positive factors detected within 48h of onset suggest severe pancreatitis, and should prompt transfer to ITU/HDU. Mnemonic: PANCREAS.

## Table 13.17

| Factor | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| PaO2 | <8kPa |
| Age | >55yrs |
| Neutrophilia | WBC >15 x 10^9/L |
| Calcium | <2mmol/L |
| Renal function | Urea >16mmol/L |
| Enzymes | LDH >600iu/L; AST >200iu/L |
| Albumin | <32g/L (serum) |
| Sugar | Blood glucose >10mmol/L |

These criteria have been validated for pancreatitis caused by gallstones and alcohol; Ranson's criteria are valid for alcohol-induced pancreatitis, and can only be fully applied after 48h, which does have its disadvantages. Other criteria for assessing severity include the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination (APACHE)-II, and the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP).

## Fig 13.45 
Axial CT of the abdomen (with IV and PO contrast media) showing a pancreatic pseudocyst occupying the lesser sac of the abdomen posterior to the stomach. It is called a 'pseudocyst' because it is not a true cyst, rather a collection of fluid in the lesser sac (ie not lined by epi/endothelium). It develops at â‰¥6wks. The cyst fluid is of low attenuation compared with the stomach contents because it has not been enhanced by the contrast media.
