# Addisonian crisis

## Signs and symptoms
Patients may present in shock (↑HR; vasoconstriction; postural hypotension; oliguria; weak; confused; comatose)—often (but not always) in a patient with known Addison's (eg when oral steroid has not been increased to cover stress such as pneumonia), or someone on long-term steroids who has forgotten their tablets. Remember bilateral adrenal haemorrhage (eg meningococcaemia) as a cause. An alternative presentation is with hypoglycaemia.

## Precipitating factors
Infection, trauma, surgery, missed medication.

## Management
If suspected, treat before biochemical results.
- Bloods for cortisol and ACTH (this needs to go straight to laboratory, call ahead!), U&Es—can have ↑K+ (check ECG and give calcium gluconate if needed, see p301) and ↓Na+ (salt depletion, should resolve with rehydration and steroids).
- Hydrocortisone 100mg IV stat.
- IV fluid bolus eg 500mL 0.9% saline to support BP, repeated as necessary.
- Monitor blood glucose: the danger is hypoglycaemia.
- Blood, urine, sputum for culture, then antibiotics if concern about infection.

## Continuing treatment
- Glucose IV may be needed if hypoglycaemic.
- Give IV fluids as guided by clinical state and to correct U&E imbalance.
- Continue hydrocortisone, eg 100mg/8h IV or IM.
- Change to oral steroids after 72h if patient's condition good.
- Fludrocortisone may well be needed if the cause is adrenal disease: ask an expert.
- Search for (and vigorously treat) the underlying cause. Get endocrinological help.

# Hypopituitary coma

Think of decompensated chronic hypophyseal failure whenever hypothermia, refractory hypotension ± septic signs without fever occur with short stature or loss of axillary/pubic hair ± gonadal atrophy. Waiting for lab confirmation may be fatal. It usually develops gradually in a person with known hypopituitarism. If rapid onset due to pituitary infarction (eg postpartum, Sheehan's, p232), subarachnoid haemorrhage is often misdiagnosed as symptoms include headache and meningism.

## Presentation
Headache; ophthalmoplegia; ↓consciousness; hypotension; hypothermia; hypoglycaemia; signs of hypopituitarism (p232).

## Tests
Cortisol; T4; TSH; ACTH; glucose. Pituitary fossa CT/MRI.

## Treatment
- Hydrocortisone, eg 100mg IV/6h.
- Only after hydrocortisone begun: liothyronine (L-tri-iodothyronine sodium), eg 10mcg/12h PO or by slow IV: 5–20mcg/12h (4-hourly may be needed).
- Prompt surgery is needed if the cause is pituitary apoplexy (p234).
