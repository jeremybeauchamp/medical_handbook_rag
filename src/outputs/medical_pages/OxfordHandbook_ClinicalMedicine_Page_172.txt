# Driving and the heart

UK licences are inscribed 'You are required by law to inform Drivers Medical Branch, DVLA, Swansea SA99 1AT at once if you have any disability (physical or medical), which is, or may become likely to affect your fitness as a driver, unless you do not expect it to last more than 3 months'. It is the responsibility of drivers to inform the DVLA (the UK Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority), and that of their doctors to advise patients that medical conditions* (and drugs) may affect their ability to drive and for which conditions patients should inform the DVLA. Drivers should also inform their insurance company of any condition disclosed to the DVLA. If in doubt, ask your defence union.

The following are examples of the guidance for holders of standard licences; different rules apply for group 2 vehicle licence-holders (eg lorries, buses). More can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cardiovascular-disorders-assessing-fitness-to-drive.

**Angina** Driving must cease when symptoms occur at rest or with emotion. Driving may recommence when satisfactory symptom control is achieved. DVLA need not be notified.

**Angioplasty** Driving must cease for 1wk, and may recommence thereafter provided no other disqualifying condition. DVLA need not be notified.

**MI** If successfully treated with angioplasty, cease driving for 1 week provided urgent intervention not planned and LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) >40%, and no other disqualifying condition. Otherwise, driving must cease for 1 month. DVLA need not be notified.

**Dysrhythmias** Including sinoatrial disease, AF/flutter, atrioventricular conduction defects, and narrow or broad complex tachycardias. Driving must cease if the dysrhythmia has caused or is likely to cause incapacity. Driving may recommence 4wks after successful control provided there is no other disqualifying condition.

**Pacemaker implant** Stop driving for 1wk, the patient must notify the DVLA.

**Implanted cardioverter/defibrillator** The licence is subject to annual review. Driving may occur when these criteria can be met:

- 6 months have passed since ICD implanted for secondary prevention.
- 1 month has passed since ICD implanted for primary prophylaxis.
- The device has not administered therapy (shock and/or symptomatic antitachycardia pacing) within the last 6 months (except during testing).
- No therapy (shock) in the last 2 years has been accompanied by incapacity (whether caused by the device or arrhythmia)—unless this was a result of device malfunction which has been corrected for at least 1 month or steps have been taken to avoid recurrence (eg ablation) which have been successful for at least 6 months.
- A period of 1 month off driving must occur following any revision of the device (generator and/or electrode) or alteration of antiarrhythmics.
- The device is subject to regular review with interrogation.
- There is no other disqualifying condition.

**Syncope** Simple faint: No restriction. Unexplained syncope: With probable cardiac aetiology—4wks off driving if cause identified and treated; otherwise 6 months off. Loss of consciousness or altered awareness associated with signs of seizure requires 6 months off driving. If the patient is known to be epileptic or has had another such episode in the preceeding 5yrs, they must abstain from driving for 1yr. See driving and epilepsy (BOX). Patients who have had a single episode of loss of consciousness with no cause found despite neurological and cardiac investigations, must abstain from driving for 6 months.

**Hypertension** Driving may continue unless treatment causes unacceptable side-effects. DVLA need not be notified.
