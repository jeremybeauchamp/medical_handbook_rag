# Gram-negative bacilli
## Enterobacteriaceae:

Enterobacteriaceae family is large: >50 genera, >170 named species. In the clinical setting, 3 species make up 80-95% of isolates:

1. **Escherichia coli**: part of normal colonic flora. Pathogenic forms can cause:
   - Intestinal disease:
     - Enterotoxigenic: a major cause of traveller's diarrhoea (pp428-9).
     - Enterohaemorrhagic: diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis eg O157:H7 (p431).
     - Enteropathogenic: infants in areas of poor sanitation.
     - Enteroinvasive: dysentery-like syndrome.
     - Enteroadherent: traveller's diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea in children/HIV.
   - Extra-intestinal disease: usually patient's own flora that is not pathogenic in the intestine but causes disease elsewhere: UTI (pp296-7); neonatal meningitis; nosocomial infection: pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis. Treat according to sensitivity: trimethoprim, ampicillin, cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin, aminoglycoside.

2. **Klebsiella pneumoniae**: colonizes skin, nasopharynx, GI tract, hospitalized patients. Associated with antibiotic exposure, in-dwelling catheters, immunosuppression. Causes pneumonia (necrotizing disease and sepsis if immunosuppressed). Also UTI, nasopharyngeal inflammation. Treat according to sensitivity: aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, carbapenem, quinolone.

3. **Proteus mirabilis**: gut commensal. Causes UTI (pp296-7). Stone formation due to urease production: breaks down urea to produce ammonia, struvite stones ('infection stones') then form in the presence of magnesium, calcium, and phosphate (pp638-9).

Other Enterobacteriaceae include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia: see enteric fever (p415), gastroenteritis (pp428-31), plague (p425).

**Resistance**: widespread antibiotic use has led to the development of highly virulent, multiple resistant E. coli and Klebsiella species including:
- extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim, tetracycline, with possible extension to other antibiotic groups
- carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).

Resistance requires antimicrobial stewardship (p384), surveillance, robust infection control, research into resistance risk and transmission (p383).

## Pseudomonas aeruginosa:

Found in environment. Spread by contact/ingestion. Presentation: important cause of nosocomial infection. Infection if compromised tissue, eg wound, pneumonia with lung disease or ventilation, UTI with catheterization. Septicaemia if immunosuppressed. Treatment: options include ceftazidime/carbapenem, aminoglycoside, colistin. Combination may be needed. Impermeability of membrane and biofilm colonization lead to antibiotic resistance. Multidrug-resistance. ▶Seek expert help.

## Haemophilus influenzae:

Divided into encapsulated, typeable forms (a-f); and unencapsulated, non-typeable forms. Upper respiratory tract carriage, transmitted by droplets. H. influenzae b (Hib) causes meningitis, epiglottitis, otitis media, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic arthritis, and bacteraemia. Fatal in ~5%. Routine immunization in childhood and splenectomy/hyposplenism (p407). Non-typeable forms cause pneumonia and sinusitis. Treatment: amoxicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin.

## Whooping cough:

Bordetella pertussis. Presentation: catarrhal phase 1-2wk, then paroxysmal coughing. 'Whoop' is a breath through partially closed vocal cords, seen mainly in children. Cough is prolonged ('100 day cough'). Infants have complications/mortality. Diagnosis: PCR nasal/throat swab. Culture sensitivity 10-60%. Treatment: macrolides ↓infectivity, but may not alter disease course. Routine childhood vaccination. Vaccination in pregnancy ↑placental antibody transfer to protect neonate (p407).

## Other:

Brucellosis (p424), cholera (p430), melioidosis (p414).
