## Oncology emergencies

Emergencies[11,12] in oncology include:

### Neutropenic sepsis
Temperature >38°C and neutrophil count <0.5×10⁹/L. Suspect in all patients who are unwell and within 6wks of receiving chemotherapy. Localizing signs may be absent. Examine indwelling catheter sites. ▶Immediate treatment saves lives. Use local guidelines or treat empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam (see p352).

### Spinal cord compression
3-5% of cancer patients have spinal metastases. ~15% of those with advanced cancers develop metastatic spinal cord compression. Most commonly associated with lung, prostate, breast, myeloma, melanoma. ▶Urgent treatment is required to preserve neurological function and relieve pain.

**Causes:** Collapse or compression of a vertebral body due to metastases (common), direct extension of a tumour into vertebral column (rare).

**Signs and symptoms:** Back pain in ~95%. Ask about nocturnal pain and pain with straining. Worry if there is cervical/thoracic pain. Also limb weakness, difficulty walking, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction. Maintain a high index of suspicion.

**Management:** Admit for bed rest and arrange urgent (within 24h) MRI of the whole spine. Give dexamethasone 16mg/24h PO with prophylatic gastroprotection, eg PPI, and blood glucose monitoring. If reduced mobility consider thromboprophylaxis (compression stockings, LMWH). Refer urgently to clinical oncology/cancer MDT. Radiotherapy is the commonest treatment and should be given within 24 hours of MRI diagnosis. Decompressive surgery ± radiotherapy may be appropriate depending on prognosis. Patients with loss of motor function after >48h are unlikely to recover function. (See also p466.)

### Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome
Reduced venous return from head, neck, and upper limbs. Due to extrinsic compression (most common), or venous thrombosis (consider if current or past central venous access). ▶SVC syndrome with airway compromise requires urgent treatment.

**Causes:** >90% of SVC syndrome results from malignancy. Most common cancers: lung (~75%), lymphoma, metastatic (eg breast), thymoma, germ cell.

**Signs and symptoms:** Diagnosis is made clinically. SOB, orthopnoea, stridor, plethora/cyanosis, oedema of face and arm, cough, headache, engorged neck veins (non-pulsatile JVP), engorged chest wall veins. Pemberton's test:¹ elevation of the arms to the side of the head causes facial plethora/cyanosis.

**Management:** Prop up. Assess for hypoxia (pulse oximetry, blood gas) and give oxygen if needed. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h. CT is used to define the anatomy of the obstruction. Balloon venoplasty and SVC stenting provide the most rapid relief of symptoms (see BOX 'Interventional oncology', p527). Treat with radiotherapy or chemotherapy depending on the sensitivity of the underlying cancer.

### Malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia
Most common metabolic abnormality in cancer patients: ~10-20% of patients with cancer, ~40% of myeloma. It is a poor prognostic sign: 75% mortality within 3 months. Calcium is highly protein-bound and needs correcting to the serum albumin concentration. PTH levels should be suppressed (see pp676-7).

**Causes:** PTH-related protein produced by the tumour (see p529), local osteolysis, eg myeloma, tumour production of calcitriol.

**Signs and symptoms:** Weight loss, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, polyuria, constipation, abdominal pain, dehydration, weakness, confusion, seizure, coma.

**Management:** Aggressive rehydration. Bisphosphonates (if eGFR ≥30), eg zoledronic acid IV, usually normalize calcium within 3 days and can be given as a repeated infusion. Calcitonin produces a more rapid (2h) but short-term effect and tolerance can develop. Long-term treatment is by control of the underlying malignancy.

¹ Pemberton described this 'useful' sign of venous obstruction due to a goitre in 1946.
