# Assessing higher mental function: a practical guide

Start by reassuring the patient 'I know this may be difficult...' and try to engage in conversation; asking questions that need to phrase to answer (ie not just yes/no). This tests fluency and reception, understanding, and allows assessment of articulation, eg 'How did you travel here today?', 'I came by bus'. Then assess dysphasia by asking: 'What is this' eg pen (tests for nominal dysphasia), repeat 'British Constitution' (tests for conduction dysphasia and dysarthria). Then ask patient to follow one-, two-, and three-step commands ensuring these 'cross the midline', eg make a fist with your right hand then extend your right index finger and touch your left ear.

## Problems with classifying dysphasias

The classical model of language comprehension occurring in Wernicke's area and language expression in Broca's area is too simple. Functional MRI studies show old ideas that processing of abstract words is confined to the left hemisphere whereas concrete words are processed on the right are too simplistic. It may be better to think of a mosaic of language centres in the brain with more or less specialized functions. There is evidence that tool-naming is handled differently and in a different area to fruit-naming. There are also individual differences in the anatomy of these mosaics. This is depressing for those who want a rigid classification of aphasia, but a source of hope to those who have had a stroke: recovery may be better than neuroimaging leads us to believe.

## Movement disorders

### Symptoms of movement disorders

**Athetosis** is due to a lesion in the putamen, causing slow sinuous writhing movements in the hands, which are present at rest. **Pseudoathetosis** refers to athetoid movements in patients with severe proprioceptive loss.

**Chorea** means dance (hence 'choreography')—a flow of jerky movements, flitting from one limb to another (each seemingly a fragment of a normal movement). Distinguish from athetosis/pseudoathetosis (above-mentioned), and hemiballismus (p468). Causes: Basal ganglia lesion (stroke, Huntington's, p702); streptococci (Sydenham's chorea; St Vitus' dance, p142); SLE (p554); Wilson's (p285); neonatal kernicterus; polycythaemia (p366); neuroacanthocytosis (genetic, with acanthocytes in peripheral blood, chorea, oro-facial dyskinesia, and axonal neuropathy); hyperthyroidism (p218); drugs (levodopa, oral contraceptives/HRT, chlorpromazine, cocaine—'crack dancing'). The early stages of chorea may be detected by feeling fluctuations in muscle tension while the patient grips your finger.

℞: Dopamine antagonists, eg tetrabenazine 12.5mg/12h (/24h if elderly) PO; increase, eg to 25mg/8h PO; max 200mg/d.

**Hemiballismus** is uncontrolled unilateral flailing movements of proximal limb joints caused by contralateral subthalamic lesions. See p468.

### Cerebellar signs

**Speech**: Slurred/ataxic/staccato. **Eye movements**: Nystagmus. **Tone and power**: Hypotonia and reduced power. **Coordination**: Finger-to-nose test; test for dysdiadochokinesis, p499. **Gait**: Broad based, patients fall to the side of the lesion. **Romberg's test**: ask patient to stand with eyes closed. If he/she loses balance, the test is positive and a sign of posterior column disease. Cerebellar disease is Romberg negative.

(DASHING: Dysdiadochokinesis, Ataxia, Slurred speech, Hypotonia and reduced power, Intention tremor, Nystagmus, broad based Gait.)

7 While abstract words activate a sub-region of the left inferior frontal gyrus more strongly than concrete words, specific activity for concrete words can also be observed in the left basal temporal cortex.
