## Assessing hypovolaemia from blood loss

Treat suspected shock rather than wait for BP to fall. The most likely cause of shock in a surgical patient is hypovolaemia. Check urine output, GCS, and capillary refill (CR) as measures of renal, brain, and skin perfusion.

When there is any blood loss, assess the status of the following:

Table 13.10 Estimating blood loss based on patient's initial presentation

| Parameter | Class I | Class II | Class III | Class IV |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Blood loss | <750mL <15% | 750-1500mL 15-30% | 1500-2000mL 30-40% | >2000mL >40% |
| Pulse | <100bpm | >100bpm | >120bpm | >140bpm |
| BP | ↔ | ↔ | ↓ | ↓ |
| Pulse pressure | ↔ or ↑ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ |
| Respirations | 14-20/min | 20-30/min | 30-40/min | >35/min |
| Urine output | >30mL/h | 20-30mL/h | 5-15mL/h | Negligible |
| Mental state | Slightly anxious | Anxious | Confused → | →Lethargic |
| Fluid to give | Crystalloid | Crystalloid | Crystalloid + blood | |

Fig 13.26 Erect CXR showing air beneath the right hemidiaphragm, indicating presence of a pneumoperitoneum. Causes:
• Bowel perforation (visible only in 75%) (fig 13.25).
• Gas-forming infection, eg C. perfringens.
• Iatrogenic, eg laparoscopic surgery (detectable on CXR up to 10d post-op).
• Per vaginam (eg sexual activity).
• Interposition of bowel between liver and diaphragm (Chilaiditi sign—not true free air).
