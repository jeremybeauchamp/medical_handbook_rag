# 566 Pre-operative care

## Aims
To provide diagnostic and prognostic information. Ensures the patient understands the nature, aims, and expected outcome of surgery. To allay anxiety and pain:
- Ensure that the right patient gets the right surgery. Have the symptoms and signs changed? If so, inform the surgeon.
- Assess/balance risks of anaesthesia, and maximize fitness. Comorbidities? Drugs? Smoker? Optimizing oxygenation before major surgery improves outcome.
- Obtain informed consent (p568).
- Check proposed anaesthesia/analgesia with anaesthetist.

## Family history
May be relevant, eg in malignant hyperpyrexia (p572); dystrophia myotonica (p510); porphyria; cholinesterase problems; sickle-cell disease.

## Drugs
Any drug/plaster/antiseptic allergies? Inform the anaesthetist about all drugs even if 'over-the-counter'. Steroids: see p590; diabetes: see p588.
- Antibiotics: Tetracycline and neomycin may ↑ neuromuscular blockade.
- Anticoagulants: Tell the surgeon. Avoid epidural, spinal, and regional blocks. Aspirin should probably be continued unless there is a major risk of bleeding. Discuss stopping clopidogrel therapy with the cardiologists/neurologists. See p590.
- Anticonvulsants: Give as usual pre-op. Post-op, give drugs IV (or by NGT) until able to take orally. Valproate: give usual dose IV. Phenytoin: give IV slowly (<50mg/min, on cardiac monitor). IM phenytoin absorption is unreliable.
- β-blockers: Continue up to and including the day of surgery as this precludes a labile cardiovascular response.
- Contraceptive pill: See BNF. Stop 4wks before major/leg surgery; ensure alternative contraception is used. Restart 2wks after surgery, provided patient is mobile.
- Digoxin: Continue up to and including morning of surgery. Check for toxicity (ECG; plasma level); do plasma K+ and Ca2+ (suxamethonium can ↑K+ and lead to ventricular arrhythmias in the fully digitalized).
- Diuretics: Beware hypokalaemia, dehydration. Do U&E (and bicarbonate).
- Eye-drops: β-blockers get systemically absorbed.
- HRT: As with contraceptive pill there may be an increased risk of DVT/PE.
- Levodopa: Possible arrhythmias when patient under GA.
- Lithium: Get expert help; may potentiate neuromuscular blockade and cause arrhythmias. See OHCS p349.
- MAOIs: Get expert help as interactions may cause hypotensive/hypertensive crises.
- Thyroid medication: see p600.
- Tricyclics: These enhance adrenaline (epinephrine) and arrhythmias.

## Preparation
Starve patient; NBM ≥2h pre-op for clear fluids and ≥6h for solids.¹
- Is any bowel or skin preparation needed, or prophylactic antibiotics (p570)?
- Start DVT prophylaxis as indicated, eg graduated compression stockings (CI in peripheral arterial disease); LMWH (p350): eg moderate risk, 20mg ~2h pre-op then 20mg/24h; high risk (eg orthopaedic surgery), 40mg 12h pre-op then 40mg/24h; or heparin 5000U SC 2h pre-op, then every 8-12h SC for 7d or until ambulant.
- Ensure necessary premedications (p572), regular medications, analgesia, anti-emetics, antibiotics are all prescribed as appropriate. Confirm NBM.
- Book any pre-, intra-, or post-operative x-rays or frozen sections.
- Book post-operative physiotherapy.
- If needed, site IV cannula, catheterize (p762), and/or insert a Ryle's tube (p759).
- Meta-analyses have shown no benefit to patients from mechanical bowel cleansing before colonic surgery—this is no longer considered good practice. There is also no evidence for the use of enemas prior to rectal surgery.
