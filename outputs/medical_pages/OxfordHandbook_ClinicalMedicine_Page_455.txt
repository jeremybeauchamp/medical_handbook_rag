## Myiasis

Infection with fly larvae/maggot. Can affect living and necrotic tissue. In south and central America the human botfly lays its eggs on mosquitoes which deposit them when they bite. In sub-Sahran Africa the tumbu fly lays its eggs on clothing which then transfer to skin. 

**Presentation:** Painful swelling. May have sensation of movement within the lesion. May open to reveal larval breathing tubes (fig 9.57). 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical. Identification of larvae in lesion. 

**Treatment:** Petroleum or pork fat cause asphyxiation of the maggot causing it to protrude further out of the skin enabling removal with tweezers. Care: backward-facing spines in American disease may prevent complete removal unless done surgically. Ensure tetanus vaccination is up to date.

## Tungiasis

Infection of the skin by the sand/jigger flea Tunga penetrans. Acquired (usually walking barefoot) in sandy soil, rainforests, and banana plantations in south and central America, sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Caribbean. 

**Presentation:** Painful, itchy papule on the feet. May be visible extrusion of eggs. Black crusting when flea dies. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical. 

**Treatment:** None, self-limiting.

## Leprosy (Hansen's disease)

Caused by slow-growing, acid-fast Mycobacterium leprae which affects skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. Incubation 5-20y. Transmitted via droplets from nose/mouth during close and frequent contact. Classified as:

- Multibacillary ('lepromatous'): ↓immune response, ↑bacilli, +ve smear.
- Paucibacillary ('tuberculoid'): ↑immune response, granulomata with ↓bacilli, smears may be -ve.

Free treatment through WHO since 1995: prevalence ↓ by 99% to 176 000 in 2014 (5.2 million in 1985).

**Presentation:** Hypopigmented skin lesions (fig 9.58, less well demarcated than vitiligo), sensory loss, thickened nerves, nodules, plaques, nasal congestion, epistaxis, muscle weakness, paralysis, neuropathic ulcers. Eye involvement: chronic iritis, scleritis, episcleritis, ↓corneal sensation (V nerve palsy), ↓blinking and lagophthalmos (VII nerve palsy), trauma from eyelashes (trichiasis). 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical, +ve skin smear, skin biopsy. Serology unreliable. 

**Treatment:** WHO multidrug therapy:
- Multibacillary: Rifampicin 600mg/month, dapsone 100mg OD, clofazimine 300mg/month and 50mg OD. Duration: 1yr.
- Paucibacillary: rifampicin 600mg/month, dapsone 100mg OD. Duration: 6 months. If single lesion: rifampicin 600mg+ofloxacin 400mg+minocycline 100mg (single dose).

## Yaws

Chronic granulomatous disease caused by Treponema pertenue. Found in humid/rainforest areas in Africa, Asia, Latin American, Pacific. Associated with ↓socio-economic conditions. Transmission via direct contact. 

**Presentation:** Primary disease = papilloma. If untreated will ulcerate (fig 9.59). Secondary disease: yellow skin lesions, dactylitis. CVS and CNS complications do not occur. 

**Diagnosis:** Serology is indistinguishable from syphilis (Treponema pallidum). Dual-path platform (DPP) assay can distinguish between current and past infection. PCR. 

**Treatment:** Single-dose azithromycin PO.
