## Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (human herpesvirus 4)

Virus targets circulating B lymphocytes (lifelong latent infection) and squamous epithelial cells of oropharynx.

Presentation: Usually asymptomatic infection in childhood. Infectious mononucleosis in ~50% of primary infection in adults: sore throat, fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy (esp. posterior triangle of neck), palatal petechiae, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaundice. Malaise is prominent. Resolution of symptoms usually within 2 weeks. Chronic active infection and recurrence are rare. Oncogenicity: see BOX 'Oncogenic viruses'.

Diagnosis:
• Blood film: lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei) also occur in other viral infection (CMV, HIV, parvovirus, dengue), toxoplasmosis, typhus, leukaemia, lymphoma, drug reactions, lead poisoning.
• Heterophile antibody tests (eg Monospot®, Paul-Bunnell) detect non-EBV heterophile antibodies which are present in ~85% of infectious mononucleosis sera. False positive: pregnancy, autoimmune disease, lymphoma/leukaemia.
• Serology: IgM to EBV viral capsid antigen in acute infection. IgG if past infection.
• Reverse transcriptase viral PCR.

Treatment: Supportive. Seek expert help if severe disease/immunosuppression: observational data on the use of antivirals and steroids.

## Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (human herpesvirus 5)

50-100% of adults are seropositive depending on socioeconomic and sexual risk.
Latent infection: periodic, asymptomatic (but infectious) viral shedding in bodily fluids including blood transfusion, transplantation (CMV+ve donor to CMV-ve recipient).

Presentation: Asymptomatic in most. Symptoms mimic infectious mononucleosis (see earlier in topic) or hepatitis. Severe disease in immunosuppressed (post-transplantation, HIV): oesophagitis, gastritis, colitis, retinitis (p438), pneumonitis, hepatitis. Infection in pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormality.

Diagnosis: Primary infection in immunocompetent: IgM. Immunosuppressed: quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing (QNAT) in blood greater than a defined threshold, or rising titre. Invasive disease: tissue QNAT, histopathology.

Treatment: Given in severe infection/immunosuppression. Ganciclovir, valganciclovir (oral bioavailability). Foscarnet and cidofovir: nephrotoxicity limit use. Pre-emptive treatment in transplant patients based on QNAT results. Risk/benefit for antivirals/immunoglobulin in pregnancy remains unclear. Use CMV-ve, irradiated blood for transfusion if immunosuppressed and at risk: transplant, HIV, leukaemia.

## Other herpes viruses

Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6): Roseola infantum, febrile illness without rash.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8): Oncogenic (see BOX 'Oncogenic viruses'), Castleman's disease.

## Oncogenic viruses

~12% of human cancers are caused by viruses, >80% of these occur in low- and middle-income countries (table 9.12).

Common traits of oncoviruses:
• Virus is necessary but not sufficient to cause cancer.
• Cancers appear in context of chronic infection, taking years-decades to appear.
• Immune system has variable role: cancers are associated with both immunosuppression and chronic inflammation.
