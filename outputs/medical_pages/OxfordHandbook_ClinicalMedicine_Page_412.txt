# Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): diagnosis

HIV is a retrovirus which infects and replicates in human lymphocytes (CD4 + T-cells) and macrophages. This leads to progressive immune system dysfunction, opportunistic infection, and malignancy = Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The virus is transmitted via blood, sexual fluids, and breast milk. Virus subtypes include HIV1 (global epidemic) and HIV2 (↓ pathogenic, predominantly West Africa).

## Epidemiology

~37 million adults and children are estimated to be living with HIV worldwide (fig 9.11), with 1.2 million deaths/yr. Africa has most of the disease (~26 million), most of the mortality (790000/yr), and ~1% of the world's wealth.

UK: estimated ~100 000 living with HIV (=1.9/1000) including 5% of men who have sex with men (MSM). ~17% of those with HIV in UK are unaware of their infection.

| Prevalence (%) by WHO region |
|------------------------------|
| Western Pacific: 0.1 [<0.1-0.2] |
| Eastern Mediterranean: 0.1 [<0.1-0.2] |
| South-East Asia: 0.3 [0.3-0.4] |
| Europe: 0.4 [0.4-0.5] |
| Americas: 0.5 [0.4-0.6] |
| Africa: 4.4 [4.0-4.8] |
| Global prevalence: 0.8% [0.7-0.9] |

## Pathophysiology

HIV binds, via its GP120 envelope glycoprotein, to CD4 receptors on helper T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. These 'CD4 cells' migrate to lymphoid tissue where the virus replicates, producing billions of new virions. These are released, and in turn infect new CD4 cells. As infection progresses, depletion or impaired function of CD4 cells leads to ↓immune function. HIV is a retrovirus: it encodes reverse transcriptase, allowing DNA copies to be produced from viral RNA. This is error prone, meaning a significant mutation rate, which contributes to treatment resistance.

## Prevention

### Sexual transmission: 
Consistent and correct use of (male and female) condoms ↓transmission by ~90%. Serosorting is the restriction of (unprotected) sex depending on HIV status. It is unsafe due to inaccuracies in HIV status (which is only as reliable as a person's last test) and failure to disclose. It does not consider transfer of treatment resistance, other STIs, or hepatitis.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): 
The short-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) after potential HIV exposure (sexual or occupational) should be considered an emergency method of HIV prevention. Can be given up to 72h (ideally <24h) after exposure. Not recommended if exposure is to a person on ART with a confirmed and sustained (>6 months) undetectable (<200 copies/mL) viral load. 1st-line PEP in UK is Truvada® (tenofovir/emtricitabine) and raltegravir for 28 days (2015) (refer to local guidelines). Test for HIV 8-12 weeks after exposure.

### Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): 
The use of ART in those at high risk of acquiring HIV including serodifferent relationships without suppression of viral load, condomless anal sex in MSM. Trials (PROUD, IPERGAY) show an 86% reduction in HIV incidence. A large scale trial of PrEP provision (2017-2020) will inform future NHS funding decisions.

### Vertical transmission: 
All pregnant women with HIV should have commenced ART by 24 weeks' gestation. Caesarean delivery indicated if viral load >50 copies/mL. Neonatal PEP is given from birth to 4wks old with formula-feeding.
