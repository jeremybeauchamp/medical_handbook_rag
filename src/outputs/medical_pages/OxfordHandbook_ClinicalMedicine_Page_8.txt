# Preface to the tenth edition

This is the first edition of the book without either of the original authorsâ€”Tony Hope and Murray Longmore. Both have now moved on to do other things, and enjoy a well-earned rest from authorship. In this book, I am joined by a Nephrologist, Gastroenterologist, and trainees destined for careers in Cardiology, Dermatology, and General Practice. Five physicians, each with very different interests and approaches, yet bringing their own knowledge, expertise, and styles. When combined with that of our specialist and junior readers, I hope this creates a book that is greater than the sum of its parts, yet true to the original concept and ethos of the original authors.

Life and medicine have moved on in the 30 years since the first edition was published, but medicine and science are largely iterative; true novel 'ground-breaking' or 'practice-changing' discoveries are rare, to quote Isaac Newton: 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants'. Therefore, when we set about writing this edition we drew inspiration from the original book and its authors; updating, adding, and clarifying, but trying to retain the unique feel and perspective that the OHCM has provided to generations of trainees and clinicians.

# Preface to the first edition

We wrote this book not because we know so much, but because we know we remember so little...the problem is not simply the quantity of information, but the diversity of places from which it is dispensed. Trailing eagerly behind the surgeon, the student is admonished never to forget alcohol withdrawal as a cause of post-operative confusion. The scrap of paper on which this is written spends a month in the pocket before being lost for ever in the laundry. At different times, and in inconvenient places, a number of other causes may be presented to the student. Not only are these causes and aphorisms never brought together, but when, as a surgical house officer, the former student faces a confused patient, none is to hand.

We aim to encourage the doctor to enjoy his patients: in doing so we believe he will prosper in the practice of medicine. For a long time now, house officers have been encouraged to adopt monstrous proportions in order to straddle the diverse pinnacles of clinical science and clinical experience. We hope that this book will make this endeavour a little easier by moving a cumulative memory burden from the mind into the pocket, and by removing some of the fears that are naturally felt when starting a career in medicine, thereby freely allowing the doctor's clinical acumen to grow by the slow accretion of many, many days and nights.
