# Arterial

## 1 General inspection
Introduction, consent, patient sitting back at 45°. Inspect skin (hair loss, etc.). Look between toes and lift up heels to inspect for ulcers.

## 2 Palpation
- Temperature: Bilaterally in thighs, legs, and feet.
- Capillary refill: Press/squeeze great toe until blanches, release, and measure time for colour to return (normal <2s).
- Peripheral pulses: Radial, brachial (medial to biceps tendon), carotid, femoral (mid-inguinal point), popliteal (flex patient's knees slightly, press into centre of popliteal fossa; fig 2.48), posterior tibial (just posterior & inferior to medial malleolus) and dorsalis pedis (between bases of 1st & 2nd metatarsals, lateral to extensor hallucis longus); assess whether palpable bilaterally. Detect rate and rhythm. For brachial and carotid, determine volume and character.
- Abdominal aorta: Palpate midline above umbilicus; position fingers either side of outermost palpable margins (fig 2.49).

## 3 Auscultation
For carotid, femoral, renal iliac, and aortic bruits.

## 4 Special tests
Buerger's test: Lift both legs to 45° above the horizontal, supporting at heels. Allow a minute for legs to become pale. If they do, ask patient to sit up and swing around to lower legs to ground—observe colour change.

## 5 Complete examination
Doppler probe to detect pulses and measure ankle-brachial pressure index; conduct neurological examination of lower limbs.

# Venous

## 1 Inspection
Introduction, consent. Inspect, initially with patient standing, for varicosities and skin changes.

## 2 Palpation
- Temperature of varicosities.
- Ask patient to cough while you palpate for impulse at SFJ and SPJ.

## 3 Tap test
Percuss lower limit of varicosity and feel for impulse at SFJ.

## 4 Auscultation
Listen for bruits over any varicosities.

## 5 Doppler
Place probe over SFJ, squeeze calf and listen. Repeat with probe at SPJ.

## 6 Tourniquet test
Elevate leg and massage veins to empty varicosities. Apply tourniquet to upper thigh. Ask patient to stand. If not controlled, repeat, placing tourniquet below knee.

## 7 Finish with examinations
Of abdomen; rectum; pelvis (♀); genitals (♂).
