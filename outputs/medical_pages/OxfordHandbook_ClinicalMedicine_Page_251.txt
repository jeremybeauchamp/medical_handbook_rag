Fig 5.27

Fig 5.27 Galactorrhoea can be prolific enough to create medium-sized galaxies (bottom right). In the Birth of the Milky Way Hera is depicted by Rubens in her chariot, being drawn through the night sky by ominous black peacocks. Between journeys, she enjoyed discussing difficult endocrinological topics with her husband Zeus (who was also her brother), such as whether women or men find sexual intercourse more enjoyable. Hera inclined to the latter—and it is on this flimsy evidence, and her gorgeous galactorrhoea, that we diagnose her hyperprolactinaemia (which is known to decrease desire, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction). In the end, this issue was settled, in favour of Zeus's view, by Tiresias, who had unique insight into this intriguing question: every time this soothsayer saw two snakes entwined, (s)he changed sex, so coming to know a thing or two about gender and pleasure. This is a primordial example of an 'N of 1' trial, where the subject is his or her own control. Generalizability can be a problem with this methodology.
