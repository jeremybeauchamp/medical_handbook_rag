# Causes of haemolytic anaemia

## Acquired

### 1. Immune-mediated/direct antiglobulin test +ve: (Coombs test, p337.)
- **Drug-induced:** causing formation of RBC autoantibodies from binding to RBC membranes (eg penicillin) or production of immune complexes (eg quinine).
- **Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA; fig 8.29):** mediated by autoantibodies causing mainly extravascular haemolysis and spherocytosis. Classify according to optimal binding temperature to RBCs: 
  - Warm AIHA: IgG-mediated, bind at body T° 37°C. Rx: Steroids/immunosuppressants (± splenectomy). 
  - Cold AIHA: IgM-mediated, bind at T° (<4°C), activating cell-surface complement. Causes a chronic anaemia made worse by cold, often with Raynaud's or acrocyanosis. Rx: keep warm. Chlorambucil may help. 
  - Causes: most are idiopathic; 2° causes of warm AIHA include lymphoproliferative disease (CLL, lymphoma), drugs, autoimmune disease, eg SLE. Cold AIHA may follow infection (mycoplasma; EBV).
- **Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria:** seen with viruses/syphilis. It is caused by Donath-Landsteiner antibodies sticking to RBCs in the cold, causing self-limiting complement-mediated haemolysis on rewarming.
- **Isoimmune:** acute transfusion reaction (p349); haemolysis of the newborn.

### 2. Direct antiglobulin/Coombs -ve AIHA: 
(2% of all AIHA.) Autoimmune hepatitis; hepatitis B & C; post flu and other vaccinations; drugs (piperacillin, rituximab).

### 3. Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA): 
Mechanical damage to RBCs in circulation, causing intravascular haemolysis and schistocytes (figs 8.30, 8.31). Causes include haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS), TTP (p315), DIC, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia. Prosthetic heart valves can also cause mechanical damage.

### 4. Infection: 
Malaria (p416): RBC lysis and 'blackwater fever' (haemoglobinuria). All infections can exacerbate haemolysis.

### 5. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: 
Rare acquired stem cell disorder, with haemolysis (esp. at night→haemoglobinuria, fig 15.8, p705), marrow failure + thrombophilia. Tests: urinary haemosiderin +ve; if suspect in Coombs -ve intravascular haemolysis, seek confirmation by flow cytometry. Rx: anticoagulation; monoclonal anticomplement antibodies (eg eculizumab); stem cell transplantation.

## Hereditary

### 1. Enzyme defects:
- **Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency (X-linked):** the chief RBC enzyme defect, affects 100 million (mainly ♂) in Mediterranean, Africa, Middle/Far East. Most are asymptomatic, but may get oxidative crises due to ↓glutathione production, precipitated by drugs (eg primaquine, sulfonamides, aspirin), exposure to Vicia faba (broad beans/favism), or illness. In attacks, there is rapid anaemia and jaundice. Film: bite- and blister-cells (figs 8.32, 8.33). Tests: Enzyme assay (>8wks after crisis as young RBCs may have enough enzyme so results normal). Rx: Avoid precipitants (eg, henna, fig 8.34); transfuse if severe.
- **Pyruvate kinase deficiency (AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE):** ↓ATP production causes ↓RBC survival. Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice; later, haemolysis with splenomegaly ± jaundice. Tests: enzyme assay. Rx: often not needed; splenectomy may help.

### 2. Membrane defects: 
All are Coombs -ve; all need folate; splenectomy helps some.
- **Hereditary spherocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT):** prevalence: 1:3000. Less deformable spherical RBCs, so trapped in spleen→extravascular haemolysis. Signs: Splenomegaly, jaundice. Tests: Mild if Hb >110g/L and reticulocytes <6%; film: fig 8.35. ↑Bilirubin (→gallstones).
- **Hereditary elliptocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT):** film: fig 8.36. Mostly asymptomatic (somewhat protects from malaria). 10% display a more severe phenotype (± death in utero).
- **Hereditary ovalocytosis and stomatocytosis are rarer.** Refer to a haematologist.

### 3. Haemoglobinopathy: 
- Sickle-cell disease (p340). 
- Thalassaemia (p342).
