# Typical effective doses

The effective dose of an examination is calculated as the weighted sum of the doses to different body tissues. The weighting factor for each tissue depends on its sensitivity. The effective dose thus provides a single dose estimate related to the total radiation risk, no matter how the radiation dose is distributed around the body. This table is certainly not to be learnt; rather it serves as a reminder of the relative exposures to radiation that we prescribe in practice. Remember that US and MRI involve no radiation, would they provide the answer?

## Table 16.1 Radiation doses in common radiological investigations

| Procedure | Typical effective dose (mSv) | CXR equivalents | Approx. equivalent period of background radiation |
|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| X-ray examinations |
| Limbs and joints | <0.01 | <1 | <2 days |
| Chest (PA) | 0.015 | 1 | 2.5 days |
| Abdomen | 0.4 | 30 | 2 months |
| Lumbar spine | 0.6 | 40 | 3 months |
| CT head | 1.4 | 90 | 7.5 months |
| CT chest | 6.6 | 440 | 3 years |
| CT abdo/pelvis | 6.7 | 450 | 3 years |
| Radionuclide studies |
| Lung ventilation | 0.4 | 30 | 9 weeks |
| Lung perfusion | 1 | 70 | 6 months |
| Bone | 3 | 200 | 1.4 years |
| PET head | 7 | 460 | 3.2 years |
| PET-CT | 18 | 1200 | 8.1 years |

## Justifying exposure to ionizing radiation

The very nature of ionizing radiation that gives us vision into the human body also gives it lethal properties. In considering the decision to expose patients to radiation, the clinical benefits should outweigh the risks of genetic mutation and cancer induction. These risks can be hard to quantify (and estimates vary wildly—extrapolation of effects from doses associated with nuclear explosions are likely unreliable) but even with strict guidelines we still have a tendency to over-exposure in medical practice. Perhaps the best advice is to be certain of the importance of every dose of radiation that you sanction, and mindful of the comparative doses involved (see table 16.1).

The responsibility lies with us not to rely too heavily on radiology. Don't request examinations to comfort patients (or appease their consultants), to replace images already acquired elsewhere (or lost) simply to avoid medico-legal issues, or when the result will not affect management. To give an idea of relative doses, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis gives a typical effective dose of 500 times as much radiation as a CXR. This important factor also tells us about the preference of ultrasound over CT when investigating abdominal and pelvic complaints such as acute appendicitis, especially given the youthful demographics of this diagnosis.

Unwitting exposure of the unborn fetus to radiation is inexcusable at any stage of gestation—unless the mother's life is in immediate danger—and it is the responsibility of the referring clinician, as well as the radiographer and the radiologist, to ensure that this is avoided.
