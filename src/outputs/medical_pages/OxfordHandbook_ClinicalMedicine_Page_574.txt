# 560 Systemic conditions causing eye signs

The eye is host to many diseases: the more you look, the more you'll see, and the more you'll enjoy, not least because the eye is as beautiful as its signs are legion.

**Behçet's** (p694.) Systemic inflammatory disorder, HLA B27 association. Causes a uveitis amongst other systemic manifestations. Cause unknown.

**Granulomatous disorders** Syphilis, TB, sarcoidosis, leprosy, brucellosis, and toxoplasmosis may inflame either the front chamber (anterior uveitis/iritis) or back chamber (posterior uveitis/choroiditis). Refer to an ophthalmologist.

**Systemic inflammatory diseases** May manifest as *iritis* in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis; *uveitis* in Behçet's; *conjunctivitis* in reactive arthritis; *scleritis* or *episcleritis* in RA, vasculitis, and SLE. Scleritis in RA and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) may damage the eye. ►►Refer urgently if eye pain. GCA causes optic nerve ischaemia presenting as sudden blindness.

**Keratoconjunctivitis sicca** A reduction in tear formation, tested by the Schirmer filter paper test (<5mm in 5min). It causes a gritty feeling in the eyes, and a dry mouth (xerostomia from saliva production). It is found on its own (Sjögren's syndrome), or with other diseases, eg SLE, RA, sarcoidosis. ℞ Artificial tears/saliva.

**Hypertensive retinopathy** ↑BP damages retinal vessels. Hardened arteries are shiny ('silver wiring'; fig 12.18) and 'nip' veins where they cross (AV nipping; fig 12.19). Narrowed arterioles may become blocked, causing localized retinal infarction, seen as cotton-wool spots. Leaks from these in severe hypertension manifest as hard exudates or macular oedema. Papilloedema (fig 12.20) or flame haemorrhages suggest accelerated hypertension (p138) requiring urgent treatment.

**Vascular occlusion** Emboli passing through the retinal vasculature may cause *retinal artery occlusion* (global or segmental retinal pallor) or *amaurosis fugax* (p476). Roth spots (small retinal infarcts) occur in infective endocarditis. In dermatomyositis, there is orbital oedema with retinopathy showing cotton-wool spots (micro-infarcts). *Retinal vein occlusion* is caused by ↑BP, age, or hyperviscosity (p372). Suspect in any acute fall in acuity. If it is the central vein, the fundus is like a stormy sunset (those angry red clouds are haemorrhages). In branch vein occlusion, changes are confined to a wedge of retina. Get expert help.

**Haematological disorders** Retinal haemorrhages occur in leukaemia; comma-shaped conjunctival haemorrhages and retinal new vessel formation may occur in sickle-cell disease. Optic atrophy is seen in pernicious anaemia (and also MS).

**Metabolic disease** Diabetes mellitus: p210. Hyperthyroid exophthalmos: p219. Lens opacities are seen in hypoparathyroidism. Conjunctival and corneal calcification can occur in hypercalcaemia. In gout, conjunctival urate deposits may cause sore eyes.

**Systemic infections** Septicaemia may seed to the vitreous causing endophthalmitis. Syphilis can cause iritis (+ pigmented retinopathy if congenital). Systemic fungal infections may affect the eye, eg in the immunocompromised or in IV drug users, requiring intra-vitreal antibiotics. AIDS and HIV CMV retinitis (pizza-pie fundus—a mixture of cotton-wool spots, infiltrates, and haemorrhages, p438) may be asymptomatic but can cause sudden visual loss. If present, it implies AIDS (CD4 count <100 × 106/L; p398). Cotton-wool spots on their own indicate HIV retinopathy and may occur in early disease. Kaposi's sarcoma may affect the lids (non-tender purple nodule) or conjunctiva (red fleshy mass).
