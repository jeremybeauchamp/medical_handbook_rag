(b) shows stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). In (c), the same patient has had their LAD stented, allowing contrast to flow freely through to the distal vessel. The stenting is a type of angioplasty (a procedure to widen the lumen of a blood vessel); in the context of coronary arteries, it is called PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention). PPCI (primary PCI) is PCI performed acutely for a patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), see p120.
