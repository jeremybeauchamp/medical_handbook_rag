# Gallstones

Bile contains cholesterol, bile pigments (from broken down Hb), and phospholipids. If the concentrations vary, different stones may form. *Pigment stones*: Small, friable, and irregular. Causes: haemolysis. *Cholesterol stones*: Large, often solitary. Causes: ♀, age, obesity (Admirand's triangle: ↑risk of stone if ↓lecithin, ↓bile salts, ↑cholesterol). *Mixed stones*: Faceted (calcium salts, pigment, and cholesterol). *Gallstone prevalence*: 8% of those over 40yrs. 90% remain asymptomatic. Risk factors for stones becoming symptomatic: smoking; parity.

## Biliary colic
Gallstones are symptomatic with cystic duct obstruction or if passed into the common bile duct (CBD¹⁰). RUQ pain (radiates → back) ± jaundice. Rx: Analgesia (see p636), rehydrate, NBM. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see BOX 'Early or delayed cholecystectomy?'). Do urinalysis, CXR, and ECG.

## Acute cholecystitis
Follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallbladder (GB¹⁰), which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right shoulder—see p609), vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a GB mass. The main difference from biliary colic is the inflammatory component (local peritonism, fever, ↑WCC; see table 13.16). If the stone moves to the CBD, obstructive jaundice and cholangitis may occur—see BOX 'Complications of gallstones'. Murphy's sign: lay 2 fingers over the RUQ; ask patient to breathe in. This causes pain & arrest of inspiration as an inflamed GB impinges on your fingers. It is only +ve if the same test in the LUQ does not cause pain. A phlegmon (RUQ mass of inflamed adherent omentum and bowel) may be palpable. Tests: ↑WCC, US—a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in chronic disease), pericholecystic fluid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only shows ~10% of gallstones; it may identify a 'porcelain' GB (associated risk of cancer). Treatment: NBM, pain relief, IVI, and antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg/8h IV. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients fit for GA. Open surgery is required if there is GB perforation. If elderly or high risk/unsuitable for surgery, consider percutaneous cholecystostomy; cholecystectomy can still be done later. Cholecystostomy is also the preferred treatment for acalculous cholecystitis.

## Chronic cholecystitis
Chronic inflammation ± colic. 'Flatulent dyspepsia': vague abdominal discomfort, distension, nausea, flatulence, and fat intolerance (fat stimulates cholecystokinin release and GB contraction). US to image stones and assess CBD diameter. MRCP (p742) is used to find CBD stones. Rx: Cholecystectomy. If US shows a dilated CBD with stones, ERCP (p742) + sphincterotomy before surgery. If symptoms persist post-surgery consider hiatus hernia/IBS/peptic ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour.

## Other presentations
- *Obstructive jaundice with CBD stones*: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with sphincterotomy ± biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open surgery with CBD exploration. If CBD stones are suspected pre-operatively, they should be identified by MRCP (p742).
- *Cholangitis*: (Bile duct infection.) Causing RUQ pain, jaundice, and rigors (Charcot's triad, BOX 'Complications of gallstones'). Treat with, eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV.
- *Gallstone ileus*: A stone erodes through the GB into the duodenum; it may then obstruct the terminal ileum. AXR shows: air in CBD (= pneumobilia), small bowel fluid levels, and a stone. Duodenal obstruction is rarer (Bouveret's syndrome).
- *Pancreatitis*: See p636.
- *Mucocoele/empyema*: Obstructed GB fills with mucus (secreted by GB wall)/pus.
- *Silent stones*: Do elective surgery on those with sickle cell, immunosuppression, (debatably diabetes) as well as all calcified/porcelain GBs.
- *Mirizzi's syndrome*: A stone in the GB presses on the bile duct causing jaundice.
- *Gallbladder necrosis*: Rare because of dual blood supply (hepatic artery via cystic artery, and from small branches of the hepatic artery in the GB fossa).
- *Other*: Causes of cholecystitis and biliary symptoms other than gallstones are rare. Consider infection (typhoid, cryptosporidiosis, and brucellosis); cholecystokinin release; parenteral nutrition; anatomical abnormality; polyarteritis nodosa (p556).
