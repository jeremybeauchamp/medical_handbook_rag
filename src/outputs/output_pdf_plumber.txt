Preface to the tenth edition
This is the fi rst edition of the book without either of the original authors—Tony Hope
and Murray Longmore. Both have now moved on to do other things, and enjoy a
well-earned rest from authorship. In this book, I am joined by a Nephrologist, Gas-
troenterologist, and trainees destined for careers in Cardiology, Dermatology, and
General Practice. Five physicians, each with very diff erent interests and approaches,
yet bringing their own knowledge, expertise, and styles. When combined with that
of our specialist and junior readers, I hope this creates a book that is greater than
the sum of its parts, yet true to the original concept and ethos of the original authors.
Life and medicine have moved on in the 30 years since the fi rst edition was published,
but medicine and science are largely iterative; true novel ‘ground-breaking’ or ‘prac-
tice-changing’ discoveries are rare, to quote Isaac Newton: ‘If I have seen further, it
is by standing on the shoulders of giants’. Therefore, when we set about writing this
edition we drew inspiration from the original book and its authors; updating, adding,
and clarifying, but trying to retain the unique feel and perspective that the OHCM has
provided to generations of trainees and clinicians.
IBW, 2017
Preface to the fi rst edition
We wrote this book not because we know so much, but because we know we
remember so little…the problem is not simply the quantity of information, but the
diversity of places from which it is dispensed. Trailing eagerly behind the surgeon,
the student is admonished never to forget alcohol withdrawal as a cause of post-
operative confusion. The scrap of paper on which this is written spends a month
in the pocket before being lost for ever in the laundry. At diff erent times, and in
inconvenient places, a number of other causes may be presented to the student.
Not only are these causes and aphorisms never brought together, but when, as a
surgical house offi cer, the former student faces a confused patient, none is to hand.
We aim to encourage the doctor to enjoy his patients: in doing so we believe he
will prosper in the practice of medicine. For a long time now, house offi cers have
been encouraged to adopt monstrous proportions in order to straddle the diverse
pinnacles of clinical science and clinical experience. We hope that this book will
make this endeavour a little easier by moving a cumulative memory burden from
the mind into the pocket, and by removing some of the fears that are naturally felt
when starting a career in medicine, thereby freely allowing the doctor’s clinical
acumen to grow by the slow accretion of many, many days and nights.
RA Hope and JM Longmore, 1985

Acknowledgements
Heart-felt thanks to our advisers on specifi c sections—each is acknowledged on
the chapter’s fi rst page. Thanks also to our junior readers, Charles Badu-Boateng,
Clare Coggins, and Luke Walls. We especially thank all our mentors and teach-
ers, and patients who provide our inspiration and remind us that one never stops
learning. We acknowledge the Department of Radiology at both the Leeds Teach-
ing Hospitals NHS Trust and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for their
kind help in providing many images, particularly Dr Edmund Godfrey, whose tire-
less hunt for perfect images has improved so many chapters.
Readers’ comments These have formed a vital part of our endeavour to provide
an accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date text. We sincerely thank the many stu-
dents, doctors, and other health professionals who have found the time and the
generosity to write to us on our Reader’s Comments Cards, in editions past, or, in
more recent times, via the web. These have now become so numerous for past edi-
tions that they cannot all be listed. See http://www.oup.com/uk/academic/series/
oxhmed/links for a full list, and our very heart-felt tokens of thanks.

‘He who studies medicine without books sails an unchartered sea, but he who
studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all’
William Osler 1849–1919
The word ‘patient’ occurs frequently throughout this book.
Do not skim over it lightly.
Rather pause and doff your metaphorical cap, off ering due respect to those
who by the opening up of their lives to you, become your true teachers.
Without your patients, you are a technician with a useless skill.
With them, you are a doctor.

The Hippocratic oath ~4th century BC 1
Is wear by Apollo the physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panacea and all the
gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfi l according to my
ability and judgement this oath and this covenant.
To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my
life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of
mine, and to regard his off spring as equal to my own brethren and to teach them
this art, if they desire to learn it, without fee and covenant. I will impart it by pre-
cept, by lecture and by all other manner of teaching, not only to my own sons but
also to the sons of him who has taught me, and to disciples bound by covenant and
oath according to the law of physicians, but to none other.
Th e regimen I shall adopt shall be to the benefi t of the patients to the best of
my power and judgement, not for their injury or any wrongful purpose.
Iw ill not give a deadly drug to anyone though it be asked of me, nor will I lead
the way in such counsel.1 And likewise I will not give a woman a pessary to pro-
cure abortion.2 But I will keep my life and my art in purity and holiness. I will not
use the knife,3 not even, verily, on suff erers of stone but I will give place to such as
are craftsmen therein.
Whatsoever house I enter, I will enter for the benefi t of the sick, refraining
from all voluntary wrongdoing and corruption, especially seduction of male
or female, bond or free.
Whatsoever things I see or hear concerning the life of men, in my attend-
ance on the sick, or even apart from my attendance, which ought not to
be blabbed abroad, I will keep silence on them, counting such things to be as reli-
gious secrets.
If I fulfi l this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and
art alike, with good repute for all time to come; but may the contrary befall me
if I transgress and violate my oath.
The endurance of the Hippocratic oath
Paternalistic, irrelevant, inadequate, and possibly plagiarized from the followers of
Pythagoras of Samos; it is argued that the Hippocratic oath has failed to evolve
into anything more than a right of passage for physicians. Is it adequate to address
the scientifi c, political, social, and economic realities that exist for doctors today?
Certainly, medical training without a fee appears to have been confi ned to history.
Yet it remains one of the oldest binding documents in history and its principles of
commitment, ethics, justice, professionalism, and confi dentiality transcend time.
The absence of autonomy as a fundamental tenet of modern medical care can
be debated. But just as anatomy and physiology have been added to the doctor’s
repertoire since Hippocrates, omissions should not undermine the oath as a para-
digm of self-regulation amongst a group of specialists committed to an ideal. And
do not forget that illness may represent a temporary loss of autonomy caused by
fear, vulnerability, and a subjective weighting of present versus future. It could
be argued that Hippocratic paternalism is, in fact, required to restore autonomy.
Contemporary versions of the oath often fail to make doctors accountable for
keeping to any aspect of the pledge. And beware the oath that is nothing more
than historic ritual without accountability, for then it can be superseded by per-
sonal, political, social, or economic priorities:
‘In Auschwitz, doctors presided over the murder of most of the one million
victims…. [They] did not recall being especially aware in Auschwitz of their
Hippocratic oath, and were not surprisingly, uncomfortable discussing it…The
oath of loyalty to Hitler…was much more real to them.’
Robert Jay Lifton, The Nazi Doctors.
1 This is unlikely to be a commentary on euthanasia (easeful death) as the oath predates the word. Rather,
it is believed to allude to the common practice of using doctors as political assassins.
2 Abortion by oral methods was legal in ancient Greece. The oath cautions only against the use of pessaries
as a potential source of lethal infection.
3 The oath does not disavow surgery, merely asks the physician to cede to others with expertise.

Medical care
Advice for doctors
• Do not blame the sick for being sick.
• Seek to discover your patient’s wishes and comply with them.
• Learn.
• Work for your patients, not your consultant.
• Respect opinions.
• Treat a patient, not a disease.
• Admit a person, not a diagnosis.
• Spend time with the bereaved; help them to shed tears.
• Give the patient (and yourself) time: for questions, to refl ect, and to allow healing.
• Give patients the benefi t of the doubt.
• Be optimistic.
• Be kind to yourself: you are not an inexhaustible resource.
• Question your conscience.
• Tell the truth.
• Recognize that the scientifi c approach may be fi nite, but experience and empathy
are limitless.
Medicine and the stars
Decision and intervention are the essence of action,
refl ection and conjecture are the essence of thought;
the essence of medicine is combining these in the ser-
vice of others. We off er our ideals to stimulate thought
and action: like the stars, ideals are hard to reach, but
they are used for navigation. Orion (fi g 1.2) is our star
of choice. His constellation is visible across the globe
so he links our readers everywhere, and he will remain
recognizable long after other constellations have dis-
torted.
Fig 1.2 The conste llation of Orion has three superb stars: Bel-
latrix (the stetho scope’s bell), Betel g euse (B), and Rigel (R). The
three stars at the crosso ver (Orion’s Belt) are Alnitak, Alnilam, and
Mint a ka.

The National Health Service
‘The resources of medical skill and the apparatus of healing shall be placed at
the disposal of the patient, without charge, when he or she needs them; that
medical treatment and care should be a communal responsibility, that they
should be made available to rich and poor alike in accordance with medical need
and by no other criteria...Society becomes more wholesome, more serene, and
spiritually healthier, if it knows that its citizens have at the back of their con-
sciousness the knowledge that not only themselves, but all their fellows, have ac-
cess, when ill, to the best that medical skill can provide...You can always ‘pass by
on the other side’. That may be sound economics. It could not be worse morals.’
Aneurin Bevan, In Place of Fear, 1952.
In 2014, the Commonwealth Fund presented an overview of international healthcare
systems examining fi nancing, governance, healthcare quality, effi ciency, evidence-
based practice, and innovation. In a scoring system of 11 nations across 11 catego-
ries, the NHS came fi rst overall, at less than half the cost per head spent in the USA.1
The King’s Fund debunks the myth that the NHS is unaff ordable in the modern era,2
although funding remains a political choice. Bevan prophesied, ‘The NHS will last as
long as there are folk left with the faith to fi ght for it.’ Guard it well.

QALYS and resource rationing 3
‘There is a good deal of hit and miss about general medicine. It is a profession
where exact measurement is not easy and the absence of it opens the mind to
endless conjecture as to the effi cacy of this or that form of treatment.’
Aneurin Bevan, In Place of Fear, 1952.
A QALY is a quality-adjusted life year. One year of healthy life expectancy = 1 QALY,
whereas 1 year of unhealthy life expectancy is worth <1 QALY, the precise value falling
with progressively worsening quality of life. If an intervention means that you are
likely to live for 8 years in perfect health then that intervention would have a QALY
value of 8. If a new drug improves your quality of life from 0.5 to 0.7 for 25 years,
then it has a QALY value of (0.7 Ω 0.5)≈25=5. Based on the price of the intervention, the
cost of 1 QALY can be calculated. Healthcare priorities can then be weighted towards
low cost QALYs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consid-
ers that interventions for which 1 QALY=<£30 000 are cost-eff ective. However, as a
practical application of utilitarian theory, QALYs remain open to criticism (table 1.1).
Remember that although for a clinician, time is unambiguous and quantifi able, time
experienced by patients is more like literature than science: a minute might be a
chapter, a year a single sentence.3
Table 1.1 The advantages and disadvantages of QALYs
Advantages Disadvantages
Transparent societal decision Focuses on slice (disease), not pie (health)
making
Common unit for diff erent Based on a value judgement that living longer is a
interventions measure of success
Allows cost-eff ectiveness Quality of life assessment comes from general public,
analysis not those with disease
Allows international comparison Potentially ageist—the elderly always have less ‘life
expectancy’ to gain
Focus on outcomes, not process ie care, compassion
The inverse care law, equity, and distributive justice:
The inverse care law states that the availability of good medical care varies inversely
with the need for it. This arises due to poorer quality services, barriers to service ac-
cess, and external disadvantage. By focusing on the benefi t gained from an interven-
tion, the QALY system treats everyone as equal. But is this really equality? Distributive
justice is the distribution of ‘goods’ so that those who are worst off become better
off . In healthcare terms, this means allocation of resources to those in greatest need,
regardless of QALYs.
Compassion
The importance of compassion4,5 in medicine is undisputed. It is an emotional re-
sponse to negativity or suff ering that motivates a desire to help. It is more than
‘pity’, which has connotations of inferiority; and diff erent from ‘empathy’, which is
a vicarious experience of the emotional state of another. It requires imaginative
indwelling into another’s condition. The fi ctional Jules Henri experiences a loss of
sense of the second person; another person’s despair alters his perception of the
world so that they are ‘connected in some universal, though unseen, pattern of
humanity’.4 With compassion, the pain of another is ‘intensifi ed by the imagina-
tion and prolonged by a hundred echoes’.5 Compassion cannot be taught; it re-
quires engagement with suff ering, cultural understanding, and a mutuality, rather
than paternalism. Adverse political, excessively mechanical, and managerial envi-
ronments discourage its expression. When compassion (what is felt) is diffi cult,
etiquette (what is done) must not fail: refl ection, empathy, respectfulness, atten-
tion, and manners count: ‘For I could never even have prayed for this: that you
would have pity on me and endure my agonies and stay with me and help me’.6

The diagnostic puzzle
How to formulate a diagnosis
Diagnosing by recognition: For students, this is the most irritating method. You
spend an hour asking all the wrong questions, and in waltzes a doctor who names
the disease before you have even fi nished taking the pulse. This doctor has simply
recognized the illness like he recognizes an old friend (or enemy).
Diagnosing by probability: Over our clinical lives we build up a personal database
of diagnoses and associated pitfalls. We unconsciously run each new ‘case’ through
this continuously developing probabilistic algorithm with increasing speed and ef-
fortlessness.
Diagnosing by reasoning: Like Sherlock Holmes, we must exclude each diff erential,
and the diagnosis is what remains. This is dependent on the quality of the diff erential
and presupposes methods for absolutely excluding diseases. All tests are statistical
rather than absolute (5% of the population lie outside the ‘normal’ range), which is
why this method remains, like Sherlock Holmes, fi ctional at best.
Diagnosing by watching and waiting: The dangers and expense of exhaustive tests
may be obviated by the skilful use of time.
Diagnosing by selective doubting: Diagnosis relies on clinical signs and investiga-
tive tests. Yet there are no hard signs or perfect tests. When diagnosis is diffi cult, try
doubting the signs, then doubting the tests. But the game of medicine is unplayable
if you doubt everything: so doubt selectively.
Diagnosis by iteration and reiteration: A brief history suggests looking for a few
signs, which leads to further questions and a few tests. As the process reiterates,
various diagnostic possibilities crop up, leading to further questions and further
tests. And so history taking and diagnosing never end.
A razor, a dictum, and a bludgeon
Consider three wise men:6
Occam’s razor: Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem translates as
‘entities must not be multiplied unnecessarily’. The physician should therefore seek
to achieve diagnostic parsimony and fi nd a single disease to explain all symptoms,
rather than proff er two or three unrelated diagnoses.
Hickam’s dictum: Patients can have as many diagnoses as they damn well
please. Signs and symptoms may be due to more than one pathology. Indeed, a
patient is statistically more likely to have two common diagnoses than one unify-
ing rare condition.
Crabtree’s bludgeon: No set of mutually inconsistent observations can exist for
which some human intellect cannot conceive a coherent explanation however
complicated. This acts as a reminder that physicians prefer Occam to Hickam: a
unifying diagnosis is a much more pleasing thing. Confi rmation bias then ensues
as we look for supporting information to fi t with our unifying theory. Remember
to test the validity of your diagnosis, no matter how pleasing it may seem.
Heuristic pitfalls
Heuristics are the cognitive shortcuts which allow quick decision-making by focus-
ing on relevant predictors. Be aware of them so you can be vigilant of their traps.7
Representativeness: Diagnosis is driven by the ‘classic case’. Do not forget the
atypical variant.
Availability: The diseases that we remember, or treated most recently, carry more
weight in our diagnostic hierarchy. Question whether this more readily available
information is truly relevant.
Overconfi dence: Are you overestimating how much you know and how well you
know it? Probably.
Bias: The hunt for, and recall of, clinical information that fi ts with our expectations.
Can you disprove your own diagnostic hypothesis?
Illusory correlation: Associated events are presumed to be causal. But was it treat-
ment or time that cured the patient?

Being wrong 5
It is always possible to be wrong8 because you remain unaware of it while it is
happening. Such error-blindness is why ‘I am wrong’ is a statement of impos-
sibility. Once you are aware that you are wrong, you are no longer wrong, and can
therefore only declare ‘I was wrong’. It is also the reason that fallibility must be
accepted as a universally human phenomenon. Conversely, certainty is the convic-
tion that we cannot be wrong because our biases and beliefs must be grounded
in fact. Certainty produces the comforting illusion that the world (and medicine)
is knowable. But be cautious of certainty for it involves a shift in perspective
inwards, towards our own convictions. This means that other people’s stories can
cease to matter to us. Certainty becomes lethal to empathy.
In order to determine how and why mistakes are made, error must be acknowl-
edged and accepted. Defensiveness is bad for progress. ‘I was wrong, but...’ is
rarely an open and honest analysis of error that will facilitate diff erent and better
action in the future. It is only with close scrutiny of mistakes that you can see the
possibility of change at the core of error. And yet, medical practice is littered with
examples of resistance to disclosure, and reward for the concealment of error.
This must change.4 Remember error blindness and protect your whistle-blowers.
Listen. It is an act of humility that acknowledges the position of others, and the
possibility of error in yourself. Knowledge persists only until it can be disproved.
Better to aspire to the aporia of Socrates:
‘At fi rst, he didn’t know...just as he doesn’t yet know the answer now either;
but he still thought he knew the answer then, and he was answering con-
fi dently, as if he had knowledge. He didn’t think he was stuck before, but
now he appreciates that he is stuck...At any rate, it would seem that we’ve
increased his chances of fi nding out the truth of the matter, because now,
given his lack of knowledge, he’ll be glad to undertake the investigation...Do
you think he’d have tried to enquire or learn about this matter when he thought
he knew it (even though he didn’t), until he’d become bogged down and stuck,
and had come to appreciate his ignorance and to long for knowledge?’
Plato: Meno and other dialogues, 402 BC; Waterfi eld translation, 2005.
Medicine, error, and the humanities
Error provides a link between medicine and the humanities. Both strive to bridge
the gap between ourselves and the world. Medicine attempts to do this in an ob-
jective manner, using disproved hypotheses (error) to progress towards a ‘truth’.
Art, however, accepts the unknown, and celebrates transience and subjectivity.
By seeing the world through someone else’s eyes, art teaches us empathy. It is at
the point where art and medicine collide that doctors can re-attach themselves
to the human race and feel those emotions that motivate or terrify our patients.
‘Unknowing’ drives medical theory, but also stories and pictures. And these are the
hallmark of our highest endeavours.
‘We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realise the truth,
at least the truth that is given to us to understand.’
Pablo Picasso in Picasso Speaks, 1923.
Duty of candour
In a world in which a ‘mistake’ can be redefi ned as a ‘complication’, it is easy to
conceal error behind a veil of technical language. In 2014, a professional duty of
candour became statutory in England for incidents that cause death, severe or
moderate harm, or prolonged psychological harm. As soon as practicable, the pa-
tient must be told in person what happened, given details of further enquiries, and
off ered an apology. But this should not lead to the proff ering of a ‘tick-box’ apology
of questionable value. Be reassured that an apology is not an admission of liability.
Risks and imperfections are inherent to medicine and you have the freedom to
be sorry whenever they occur. Focus not on legislation, but on transparency and
learning. The ethics of forgiveness require a complete response in which the pa-
tient’s voice is placed at the heart of the process.9

Bedside manner and communication skills
A good bedside manner is dynamic. It develops in the light of a patient's needs and is
grounded in honesty, humour, and humility, in the presence of human weakness. But
it is fragile: `It is unsettling to fi nd how little it takes to defeat success in medicine...
You do not imagine that a mere matter of etiquette could foil you. But the social
dimension turns out to be as essential as the scientifi c... How each interaction is
negotiated can determine whether a doctor is trusted, whether a patient is heard,
whether the right diagnosis is made, the right treatment given. But in this realm
there are no perfect formulas.' (Atul Gawande, Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance, 2008)
A patient may not care how much you know, until they know how much you care.
Without care and trust, there can be little healing. Pre-set formulas off er, at best,
a guide:
Introduce yourself every time you see a patient, giving your name and your role.
‘Introductions are about making a human connection between one human being
who is suffering and vulnerable, and another human being who wishes to help.
They begin therapeutic relationships and can instantly build trust’
Kate Granger, hellomynameis.org.uk, #hellomynameis
Be friendly. Smile. Sit down. Take an interest in the patient and ask an unscripted
question. Use the patient’s name more than once.
Listen. Do not be the average physician who interrupts after 20–30 seconds.
‘Look wise, say nothing, and grunt. Speech was given to conceal thought.’
William Osler (1849–1919).
Increase the wait-time between listening and speaking. The patient may say more.
Pay attention to the non-verbal. Observe gestures, body language, and eye contact.
Be aware of your own.
Explain. Consider written or drawn explanations. When appropriate, include rela-
tives in discussions to assist in understanding and recall.
Adapt your language. An explanation in fl uent medicalese may mean nothing to
your patient.
Clarify understanding. ‘Acute’, ‘chronic’, ‘dizzy’, ‘jaundice’, ‘shock’, ‘malignant’, ‘re-
mission’: do these words have the same meaning for both you and your patient?
Be polite. It requires no talent.
‘Politeness is prudence and consequently rudeness is folly. To make enemies by
being...unnecessarily rude is as crazy as setting one’s house on fi re.’
Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860).
Address silent fears. Give patients a chance to raise their concerns: ‘What are you
worried this might be?’, ‘Some people worry about...., does that worry you?’
Consider the patient’s disease model. Patients may have their own explanations
for their symptoms. Acknowledge their theories and, if appropriate, make an eff ort
to explain why you think them unlikely.
‘A physician is obligated to consider more than a diseased organ, more even than
the whole man - he must view the man in his world.’
Harvey Cushing (1869–1939).
Keep the patient informed. Explain your working diagnosis and relate this to their
understanding, beliefs, and concerns. Let them know what will happen next, and the
likely timing. ‘Soon’ may mean a month to a doctor, but a day to a patient. Apologize
for any delay.
Summarize. Is there anything you have missed?
Communication, partnership, and health promotion are improved when doctors are
trained to KEPe Warm:10
• Knowing—the patient’s history, social talk.
• Encouraging—back-channelling (hmmm, aahh).
• Physically engaging—hand gestures, appropriate contact, lean in to the patient.
• Warm up—cooler, professional but supportive at the start of the consultation,
making sure to avoid dominance, patronizing, and non-verbal cut-off s (ie turning
away from the patient) at the end.

Asking questions 7
Open questions ‘How are you?’, ‘How does it feel?’ The direction a patient
chooses off ers valuable information. ‘Tell me about the vomit.’ ‘It was dark.’
‘How dark?’ ‘Dark bits in it.’ ‘Like…?’ ‘Like bits of soil in it.’ This information is
gold, although it is not cast in the form of coff ee grounds.
Patient-centred questions Patients may have their own ideas about what
is causing their symptoms, how they impact, and what should be done. This is
ever truer as patients frequently consult Dr Google before their GP. Unless their
ideas, concerns, and expectations are elucidated, your patient may never be
fully satisfi ed with you, or able to be fully involved in their own care.
Considering the whole Humans are not self-suffi cient units; we are complex
relational beings, constantly reacting to events, environments, and each other.
To understand your patient’s concerns you must understand their context:
home-life, work, dreams, fears. Information from family and friends can be very
helpful for identifying triggering and exacerbating factors, and elucidating the
true underlying cause. A headache caused by anxiety is best treated not with
analgesics, but by helping the patient access support.
Silence and echoes Often the most valuable details are the most diffi cult to
verbalize. Help your patients express such thoughts by giving them time: if you
interrogate a robin, he will fl y away; treelike silence may bring him to your hand.
‘Trade Secret: the best diagnosticians in medicine are not internists, but pa-
tients. If only the doctor would sit down, shut up, and listen, the patient will
eventually tell him the diagnosis.’
Oscar London, Kill as Few Patients as Possible, 1987.
Whilst powerful, silence should not be oppressive—try echoing the last words
said to encourage your patient to continue vocalizing a particular thought.
Try to avoid
Closed questions: These permit no opportunity to deny assumptions. ‘Have you
had hip pain since your fall?’ ‘Yes, doctor.’ Investigations are requested even
though the same hip pain was also present for many years before the fall!
Questions suggesting the answer: ‘Was the vomit black—like coff ee grounds?’
‘Yes, like coff ee grounds, doctor.’ The doctor’s expectations and hurry to get the
evidence into a pre-decided format have so tarnished the story as to make it
useless.
Shared decision-making: no decision about me, without me
Shared decision-making aims to place patients’ needs, wishes, and preferences at
the centre of clinical decision-making.
• Support patients to articulate their understanding of their condition.
• Inform patients about their condition, treatment options, benefi ts, and risk.
• Make decisions based on mutual understanding.
Consider asking not, ‘What is the matter?’ but, ‘What matters to you?’.
Consider also your tendency towards libertarian paternalism or ‘nudge’. This is when
information is given in such a way as to encourage individuals to make a particular
choice that is felt to be in their best interests, and to correct apparent ‘reasoning
failure’ in the patient. This is done by framing the information in either a positive or
negative light depending on your view and how you might wish to sway your audi-
ence. Consider the following statements made about a new drug which off ers 96%
survival compared to 94% with an older drug:
• More people survive if they take this drug.
• This new drug reduces mortality by a third.
• This new drug benefi ts only 2% of patients.
• There may be unknown side-eff ects to the new drug.
How do you choose?

Prescribing drugs
Consult the BNF or BNF for Children or similar before giving any drug with which
you are not thoroughly familiar.
Check the patient’s allergy status and make all reasonable attempts to qualify the
reaction (table 1.2). The burden of iatrogenic hospital admission and avoidable drug-
related deaths is real. Equally, do not deny life-saving treatment based on a mild and
predictable reaction.
Check drug interactions meticulously.
Table 1.2 Drug reactions
Type of reaction Examples
True allergy Anaphylaxis: oedema, urticaria, wheeze (p794–5)
Side-eff ect All medications have side-eff ects. The most common are rash,
itch, nausea, diarrhoea, lethargy, and headache
Increased eff ect/ Due to inter-individual variance. Dosage regimen normally cor-
toxicity rects for this but beware states of altered drug clearance such
as liver and renal (p305) impairment
Drug interaction Reaction due to drugs used in combination, eg azathioprine and
allopurinol, erythromycin and warfarin
Remember primum non nocere: fi rst do no harm. The more minor the illness, the
more weight this carries. Overall, doctors have a tendency to prescribe too much
rather than too little.
Consider the following when prescribing any medication:
1 The underlying pathology. Do not let the amelioration of symptoms lead to
failure of investigation and diagnosis.
2 Is this prescription according tob est evidence?
3 Drug reactions. All medications come with risks, potential side-eff ects, incon-
venience to the patient, and expense.
4 Is the patient takingo ther medications?
5 Alternatives to medication. Does the patient really need or want medication?
Are you giving medication out of a sense of needing to do something, or because
you genuinely feel it will help the patient? Is it more appropriate to off er infor-
mation, reassurance, or lifestyle modifi cation?
6 Is there a risk ofo verdose or addiction?
7 Can you assist the patient? Once per day is better than four times. How easy is it
to open the bottle? Is there an intervention that can help with medicine manage-
ment, eg a multi-compartment compliance aid, patient counselling, an IT solution
such as a smartphone app?
8 Future planning. How are you going to decide whether the medication has
worked? What are the indications to continue, stop, or change the prescribed
regimen?
In appreciation of pain
Pain is often seen as an unequivocally bad thing, and certainly many patients
dream of a life without pain. However, without pain we are vulnerable to ourselves
and our behaviours, and risk ignorance of underlying conditions.
While most children quickly learn not to touch boiling water as their own body
disciplines their behaviour with the punishment of pain; children born with con-
genital insensitivity to pain (CIPA) can burn themselves, break bones, and tear skin
without feeling any immediate ill eff ect. Their health is constantly at risk from
unconsciously self-mutilating behaviours and unnoticed trauma. CIPA is very rare
but examples of the human tendency for self-damage without the protective fac-
tor of pain are common. Have you ever bitten your tongue or cheek after a dental
anaesthetic? Patients with diabetic neuropathy risk osteomyelitis and arthropa-
thy in their pain-free feet.
If you receive a message of bad news, you do not solve the problem by hiding the
message. Listen to the pain as well as making the patient comfortable.

Compliance and concordance 9
Compliance embodies the imbalance of power between doctor and patient: the
doctor knows best and the patient’s only responsibility is to comply with that
monopoly of medical knowledge. Devaluing of patients and ethically dubious, the
term ‘compliance’ has been relegated from modern prescribing practice. Con-
cordance is now king: a prescribing agreement that incorporates the beliefs and
wishes of the patient.
Only 50–70% of patients take medicines as prescribed to them. This leads to
concern over wasted resources and avoidable illness. Interventions that increase
concordance are promoted using the mnemonic: Educating Patients Enhances
Care Received
• Explanation: discuss the benefi ts and risks of taking and not-taking medication.
Some patients will prefer not to be treated and, if the patient has capacity and
understands the risks, such a decision should be respected.
• Problems: talk through the patient’s experience of their treatment—have they
suff ered side-eff ects which have prompted non-concordance?
• Expectations: discuss what they should expect from their treatment. This is im-
portant especially in the treatment of silent conditions where there is no symp-
tomatic benefi t, eg antihypertensive treatment.
• Capability: talk through the medication regimen with them and consider ways
to reduce its complexity.
• Reinforcement: reproduce your discussion in written form for the patient to take
home. Check how they are managing their medications when you next see them.
But remember that there is little evidence that increasing information improves
concordance. And if concordance is increased solely by the ‘education’ of the pa-
tient then it starts to look a lot like compliance.11 A truly shared agreement will
not always ‘comply’ or ‘concord’ with the prescriber. The capacity of the informed
individual to consent or not, means that in some cases, concordance looks more
like informed divergence.
The placebo eff ect
The placebo eff ect is a well-recognized phenomenon whereby patients improve af-
ter undergoing therapy that is believed by clinicians to have no direct eff ect on the
pathophysiology of their disease. The nature of the therapy (pills, rituals, massages)
matters less than whether the patient believes the therapy will help.
Examples of the placebo eff ect in modern medicine include participants in the pla-
cebo arm of a clinical trial who see dramatic improvements in their refractory illness,
and patients in severe pain who assume the saline fl ush prior to their IV morphine
is opioid and reporting relief of pain before the morphine has been administered. It
is likely that much of the symptomatic relief experienced from ‘active’ medicines in
fact results from a placebo eff ect.
The complementary therapy industry has many ingenious ways of utilizing the
placebo eff ect. These can give great benefi ts to patients, often with minimal risk; but
there remains the potential for signifi cant harm, both fi nancially and by dissuading
patients from seeking necessary medical help.
Why evolution has given us bodies with a degree of self-healing ability in response
to a belief that healing will happen, and not in response to a desire for healing, is
unclear. Perhaps the belief that a solution is underway ‘snoozes’ the internal alarm
systems that are designed to tell us there is a problem, and so improve the symptoms
that result from the body’s perception of harm.
Many patients who receive therapies are unaware of their intended eff ects, thus
missing out on the narrative that may give them an expectation of improvement. Try
to fi nd time to discuss with your patients the story of how you hope treatment will
address their problems.

Surviving life on the wards
The ward round
• All entries on the patient record must have: date, time, the name of the clinician
leading the interaction, the clinical fi ndings and plan, your signature, printed name,
and contact details. Make sure the patient details are at the top of every side of
paper. Write legibly—this may save more than the patient.
• A problem list will help you structure your thoughts and guide others.
• BODEX: Blood results, Observations, Drug chart, ECG, X-rays. Look at these. If you
think there is something of concern, make sure someone else looks at them too.
• Document what information has been given to the patient and relatives.
Handover
• Make sure you know when and where to attend.
• Make sure you understand what you need to do and why. ‘Check blood results’ or
‘Review warning score’ is not enough. Better to: ‘Check potassium in 4 hours and
discuss with a senior if it remains >6.0mmol/L’ .
On call
• Write it down.
• The ABCDE approach (p779) to a sick patient is never wrong.
• Try and establish the clinical context of tasks you are asked to do. Prioritize and let
staff know when you are likely to get to them.
• Learn the national early warning score (NEWS) (p892, fi g A1).
• Smile, even when talking by phone. Be polite.
• Eat and drink, preferably with your team.
Making a referral
• Have the clinical notes, observation chart, drug chart, and investigation results to
hand. Read them before you call.
• Use SBAR: Situtation (who you are, who the patient is, the reason for the call),
Background, Assessment of the patient now, Request.
• Anticipate: urine dip for the nephrologist, PR exam for the gastroenterologist.
Living with blood spattered armour
With the going down of the sun we can momentarily cheer ourselves up by the
thought that we are one day nearer to the end of life on earth—and our respon-
sibility for the unending tide of illness that fl oods into our corridors, and seeps
into our wards and consulting rooms. Of course you may have many other quiet
satisfactions, but if not, read on and wink with us as we hear some fool telling us
that our aim should be to produce the greatest health and happiness for the great-
est number. When we hear this, we don’t expect cheering from the tattered ranks
of on-call doctors; rather, our ears detect a decimated groan, because these men
and women know that there is something at stake in on-call doctoring far more
elemental than health or happiness: namely survival.
Within the fi rst weeks, however brightly your armour shone, it will now be
smeared and spattered, if not with blood, then with the fallout from the many
decisions that were taken without suffi cient care and attention. Force majeure on
the part of Nature and the exigencies of ward life have, we are suddenly stunned
to realize, taught us to be second-rate; for to insist on being fi rst-rate in all areas
is to sign a death warrant for ourselves and our patients. Don’t keep re-polishing
your armour, for perfectionism does not survive untarnished in our clinical world.
Rather, to fl ourish, furnish your mind and nourish your body. Regular food makes
midnight groans less intrusive. Drink plenty: doctors are more likely to be oliguric
than their patients. And do not voluntarily deny yourself the restorative power of
sleep, for it is our natural state, in which we were fi rst created, and we only wake
to feed our dreams.
We cannot prepare you for fi nding out that you are not at ease with the person
you are becoming, and neither would we dream of imposing a specifi c regimen of
exercise, diet, and mental fi tness. Finding out what can lead you through adversity
is the art of living.

On being busy: Corrigan’s secret door 11
Dr Corrigan of Dublin was:
‘tall, erect, of commanding fi gure...He had the countenance of an intellectual...
and his face “beamed with kindness”...In temperament his distinguishing
traits were kindness and tenderness towards the sick, and the ability to make
a bold decision.’
E. O’Brien, Conscience and Confl ict: A Biography of Sir Dominic Corrigan 1802–1880, 1983
Was he busy? At the start of his professional life he was advised that the best way
to get business was to pretend to have it. It was suggested that a note marked ‘Im-
mediate and pressing’ should be ostentatiously handed to him at the dinner table,
but always at a suitable time so as not to miss the best food. Such advice was not
taken. Corrigan aspired to hard work and taught his students the value of ‘never
doing nothing’. The city in which he practised had a ‘degree of fi lth, stench and dark-
ness, inconceivable by those who have not experienced them’, and ‘not enough hos-
pital beds to care for the great numbers in need.’ And so the story of a secret door,
made in his consulting room, to escape the ever growing queue of eager patients.
In times of chaos, fi lled with competing, urgent, simultaneous demands, excessive
paperwork, too few beds, eff ort–reward imbalance, personal sacrifi ce, and despair;
we all need Corrigan to take us by the shadow of our hand, and walk with us through
a secret door into a calm inner world. Our metaphorical door has fi ve parts:
1 Howeverl onely you feel, you are not usually alone. Do not pride yourself on not
asking for help. If a decision is a hard one, share it with a colleague.
2 Take any chance you get to sit down and rest. Have a cup of tea with other
members of staff , or with a friendly patient (patients are sources of renewal,
not just devourers of your energies).
3 Do not miss meals. If there is no time to go to the canteen, ensure that food is
put aside for you to eat when you can: hard work and sleeplessness are twice
as bad when you are hungry.
4 Avoid making work for yourself. It is too easy for doctors, trapped in their
image of excessive work, and blackmailed by misplaced guilt, to remain on the
wards re-clerking patients, re-writing notes, or re-checking results at an hour
when the priority should be caring for themselves.
5 Look to the future. Plan for a good time after a bad rota.
The origins of the story of Corrigan’s secret door are unknown. It may never have
existed other than in these hallowed pages. But when the legend becomes fact,
print the legend.7
Resilience and coping
‘Burnout’ is common in clinical medicine. It is a syndrome of lost enthusiasm, re-
duced empathy, increased cynicism, and a decrease in the meaningfulness of work.
Coping styles and resilience can protect doctors and better equip them to meet, and
learn from, the challenges of clinical practice:12
• Self-directedness correlates strongly with resilience. A personal sense of responsi-
bility allows learning from mistakes and moving on.
• Cooperativeness is the ability to work with opinions and behaviours diff erent to
your own, preventing them becoming a source of stress.
• Clinicians who are low in harm avoidance are better able to accept uncertainty and
a degree of risk. This facilitates decision-making as it is unclouded by anxiety and
pessimism about potential problems. Supervised experience outside your comfort
zone may help you deal better with uncertainty.
• Be persistent but set realistic goals. Perfectionism can be detrimental.
• Task-orientated coping occurs when a situation is seen as changeable. This is as-
sociated with less burnout than emotion-orientated coping when situations are
considered unchangeable: don’t just do something, stand there.
• Be self-aware. Development or modifi cation of your personality traits may reduce
your vulnerability.

Death
The wisdom of death
Death is nature’s cruel master stroke, allowing genotypes space to try new pheno-
types. The time comes in the life of every organism when it is better to start from
scratch, rather than carry on with the weight and muddle of endless accretions.
Our bodies and minds are the perishable phenotypes on the wave of our genes. But
our genes are not really our genes. It is we who belong to them for a few decades.
And death is nature’s great insult, that she should prefer to put all her eggs in the
basket of a defenceless, incompetent neonate; rather than in the tried and tested
custody of our own superb minds. But as our neurofi brils begin to tangle, and that
neonate walks to a wisdom that eludes us, we are forced to give nature credit for
her daring idea. Of course, nature, in her careless way, can get it wrong: people
often die in the wrong order and one of our chief roles is to prevent this misorder-
ing of deaths, not the phenomenon of death itself. With that exception, we must
admit that dying is a brilliant idea, and one that it is most unlikely we would ever
have devised ourselves.
Diagnosing dying
Would you be surprised if your patient were to die in the next few days, weeks, or
months? If the answer is ‘no’ then end-of-life choices, decisions, and care should be
addressed.
Consider: decline in functional performance, eg in bed or chair >50% of day, in-
creasing dependence, weight of co-morbidity, unstable or deteriorating symptom
burden, decreased treatment response, weight loss >10% in 6 months, crisis admis-
sions, serum albumin <25g/L, sentinel event, eg fall, transfer to nursing home.
Diagnosing death
Death13 is the irreversible loss of the essential characteristics which are necessary
for the existence of a human being.
Death following cessation of cardiorespiratory function:
Simultaneous and irreversible onset of apnoea, absence of circulation, and un-
consciousness.
Cardiorespiratory arrest is confi rmed by observation of the following:
• Absence of central pulse on palpation.
• Absence of heart sounds on auscultation.
• After 5 minutes of cardiorespiratory arrest absence of brainstem activity is con-
fi rmed by the absence of pupillary responses to light, an absent corneal refl ex,
and no motor response to supra-orbital pressure.
The time of death is the time at which these criteria are fulfi lled.
Brainstem death:
Brainstem pathology causing irreversible damage to its integrative functions
including neural control of cardiorespiratory function and consciousness.
Diagnosed by an absence of brainstem refl exes:
• No pupil light response.
• No corneal refl ex (blink to touch).
• Absent oculovestibular refl exes (no eye movements seen with injection of ice-
cold water into each external auditory meatus, tympanic membranes visualized).
• No motor response to stimulation within the cranial nerve distribution (supra-
orbital pressure).
• No cough/gag refl ex.
• No respiratory response to hypercarbia: oxgenation is maintained (SpO>85%)
2
but ventilation is reduced to achieve P aCO
2
≥6.0kPa with pH ≤7.40. No respiratory
response is seen within 5 minutes and P aCO
2
rises by >0.5kPa.
Diagnosis is made by two competent doctors registered for >5 years testing to-
gether completely and successfully on two separate occasions.

Managing death 13
Death may be regarded as a medical failure rather than an inevitable consequence
of life. But when medical treatments can no longer off er a cure, and a patient enters
the end of life, active management of death is vital. Remember that the focus of
medicine is narrow and concerned more with the repair of health, rather than the
sustenance of the soul. This medical imperative may fail in its duty to make life-in-
death better. Priorities at the end of life include freedom from pain, achieving a sense
of completeness, being treated as a whole person, and fi nding peace with God.14
Swift death due to a catastrophic event is rare. Most death is the end product of
a struggle with long-term, progressive disease: cancer, COPD, vascular disease, neu-
rological deterioration, frailty, or dementia. Although death is inevitable, prognos-
tication is diffi cult and inaccurate with remarkable variation in time to death. The
patient in front of you may be the median, mean, or on the 99th centile. Dare to hope,
but prepare for the worst. Prioritize preferences and aim to meet individual needs.15
• Seek help from experienced members of staff including palliative care teams.
• Elicit needs: physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual. Discuss fears.
• Establish the wishes of the patient. What trade-off s are they willing to accept,
eg treatment toxicity for potential time gained? What is unacceptable to them?
• Consider the views of those important to the patient.
• Hydration: give support to allow the dying to drink, off er mouth care. Consider
clinically assisted hydration (parenteral, enteral, intravenous) according to wish-
es and if distressing signs/symptoms of dehydration are possible. Stop according
to wishes and harm.
• Manage pain promptly and eff ectively. Treat any reversible causes of pain.
• Consider a syringe pump if symptom control medications are required more than
twice in 24 hours (see p536).
• Anticipate likely symptoms: the PRN side of the drug chart should cover all pos-
sibilities (see p536).
Death may or may not come with peace and acceptance. Patients may rage might-
ily against the dying of the light. Bear witness for them: listen and hold their hand.
Organ donation
Over 6000 people are waiting for an organ transplant in the UK and approximately
1000 people in need of a transplant will die each year (see p308).
Any patient who is a potential donor can be referred to a specialist organ donation
service. That service will provide advice as to suitability for transplantation and will
coordinate the approach to families. They are contactable 24 hours a day and their
details will be held in your A&E and/or ITU departments.
Organs can be retrieved from:
• donor after brainstem death or heart-beating donor.
• donor after cardiac death or non-heart-beating donor. Includes death following
unsuccessful CPR and patients for whom death is inevitable but do not meet the
criteria for brainstem death.
There are two legislative frameworks for organ donation:
• Opt-in. Donors give their explicit consent
• Opt-out. Anyone who has not actively refused consent is a donor.
The association between an opt-out system and higher organ donation rates is
complicated by the presence of multiple cofounding factors. Non-legislative change
including national coordination, support and training of clinicians, routine discussion
as part of end-of-life care, and effi cient organ retrieval also increase donation rates.
The ethics of presumed consent should also be considered: the absence of an objec-
tion would not be an acceptable substitute for informed consent in other areas of
clinical practice.
In the UK, although consent for transplantation rests with the deceased, if the
patient’s family or representative cannot support donation then it will not go ahead.
Register your decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register (https://www.organdonation.
nhs.uk/register-to-donate/register-your-details/) and more importantly, let your family know
your wishes.

Medical ethics
‘Our clinical practice is steered by ethical principles. They guide the decisions we
make in our clinics and ward rounds, what we tell our patients, and what we
omit to tell them.’ Tony Lopez, Journal of Royal Society of Medicine 2001;94:603–4.
In the silences of our consultations it is we who are under the microscope, and
we cannot escape our destiny in the sphere of ethics. To give us courage in this
enterprise, we can recall the law of the aviator and seagull: it is only by facing the
prevailing wind that we can become airborne, and achieve a new vantage point from
which to survey our world. We hope for moral perception: to be able to visualize the
morally salient features of a situation. For without this, ethical issues may fl oat past
never to be resolved. Be alert to words which may carry hidden assumptions: ‘futil-
ity’, ‘consent’, ‘best interests’.16 Consider WIGWAM in your routine patient review:
• Wishes of the patient: are they known or unknown?
• Issues of confi dentiality/disclosure.
• Goals of care: are they clear? Whose are they: yours or the patient’s?
• Wants: to decline treatment or discharge against advice.
• Arguments between family/friends/doctors.
• Money: concerns of the patient, concerns of the healthcare provider.
Ethical frameworks
Off er structure, comprehensiveness, and transparency in deliberation.16,17
Four principles
Autonomy: Self governance: the ability of a patient to make a choice based on their
own values and beliefs. Benefi cence: The obligation to benefi t patients. Links with
autonomy as benefi t is dependent upon the view of the patient. Non-malefi cence:
Do not harm. Or more appropriately, do no overall harm: you should stick a needle
into someone when they need dialysis. Justice: A collection of obligations including
legality, human rights, fairness, and resource distribution.
Four quadrants method
Medical indications: Identify the clinical problem, treatment options, goals of treat-
ment, and likelihood of success. Patient preferences: What is the patient’s autono-
mous decision? (And is the patient capable of making one? If not, look for previously
expressed wishes from advanced directives, family, friends, GP.) Quality of life: How
will the proposed treatment aff ect quality of life? This is subjective: recognize your
own biases and accommodate those of the patient. Contextual factors: The wider
context: legal, cultural, religious, familial, and anything else that may impact.
These frameworks describe individual voices within the ethics choir. Sometimes
there is a beautiful harmony, but how should you act when there is discordance?
There is no hierarchy within the frameworks. Each component is binding unless it
is trumped by a stronger principle. How you weigh up and balance the ethical com-
ponents of a situation is not easy, but it should be clear and justifi ed. Know the
patient. Consult others, especially those who hold diff erent opinions to yourself. Can
you adequately defend your decision to the patient? Their family? Your consultant?
Another consultant? A lawyer? If an investigative journalist were to sit on a sulcus
of yours, having full knowledge of all thoughts and actions, would he be composing
vitriol for tomorrow’s newspapers? If so, can you answer him, point for point?
Beyond the ethical framework
To force an ethical problem to fi t a framework may be inadequate, reduction-
istic, and inconsistent.18 It is potentially biased towards Western culture, dis-
counts the non-autonomous, and is vulnerable to poorly considered emphasis
and error. ‘Doing’ ethics can become a check-list exercise where thinking is lost.
But doctors are not moral philosophers. They are clinicians. A framework there-
fore provides a starting point from which to work. It is the toe which tests the
water of moral deliberation. Be aware of the cultural setting of your dilemma
and consider carefully the weight of synthesis. Be prepared to wade deeper if
needed. But acknowledge that moral wisdom may well be out of your depth.

Psychiatry on medical and surgical wards 15
‘Body and soul cannot be separated for purposes of treatment, for they are one
and indivisible. Sick minds must be healed as well as sick bodies.’ C Jeff Miller, 1931.
Mental state examination: ASEPTIC
• Appearance and behaviour: dress, hygiene, eye contact, rapport.
• Speech: volume, rate, tone.
• Emotion: mood (subjective and objective), aff ect (how mood is expressed with
behaviour—appropriate or incongruent?).
• Perception: hallucinations—auditory (in the second or third person)?, visual?
• Thought:
• Form: block, insertion, broadcast, fl ight of ideas, knight’s move.
• Content: delusions, obsessions, phobias, preoccupations, self-harm, suicide.
• Insight: ask the patient why they have presented today.
• Cognition: orientation, registration, recall, concentration, knowledge.
Do not be afraid to ask about suicidal thoughts and plans. Remove yourself from the
situation if you feel threatened.
Depression
Two questions can be used to identify depression:19
1 During the last month, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed,
or hopeless?
2 During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest
or pleasure in doing things?
If a person answers ‘yes’ to either question they should undergo mental health as-
sessment including a risk assessment of self-harm and suicide. Appropriate treat-
ments include psychosocial intervention (guided self-help, cognitive behavioural
therapy, structured physical activity) and medication. Treatment choice depends on
disease severity, previous psychiatric history, response to treatment, and patient
preference. If medication is indicated, a generic SSRI should be considered fi rst line
after consideration of GI bleeding risk, drug interactions, toxicity, overdose, and dis-
continuation symptoms. The full eff ect of medication is gradual, over 4–6 weeks.
Capacity
The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 has a two-stage test for lack of capacity:
1 There is an impairment or disturbed functioning of the mind.
2 The patient is unable to make a decision.
Decision-making is impaired if the patient is unable to: understand the relevant
information, retain it for long enough to make a decision, weigh up the informa-
tion, communicate their decision. Capacity is decision-specifi c not patient-specifi c.
When treatment is proposed to those who lack capacity, a capacity advocate should
be provided. Even patients without capacity should be as involved as possible in
decision-making.
Mental Health Act (MHA) and common law
A patient can be detained under common law (subject to a test of reasonableness)
or under the MHA, only if they lack capacity to remain informally and are a danger
to themselves or others. You will have more experience in verbal and non-verbal
communication, than in detention under the MHA, so use these skills fi rst to try and
de-escalate the situation. If rapid tranquillization is needed, be familiar with dosage,
side-eff ects, and the need for ongoing observation. If there is no history to guide
choice of medication, intramuscular lorazepam can be used.20
Doctors and mental health
Suicide rates are three times higher in doctors compared to the general population.
Up to 7% of doctors will have a substance abuse problem within their lifetime. Do
not ignore feeling low, poor concentration, and reduced energy levels. Do not self-
diagnose and manage. Avoid ‘corridor consultations’. Trust your GP. Seek support:
• British Medical Association: www.bma.org.uk/doctorsfordoctors.
• Doctors’ Support Network: www.dsn.org.uk.
• Doctors’ Support Line: 0844 395 3010.
• Sick Doctors Trust: www.sick-doctors-trust.co.uk.

The older person
‘To know how to grow old is the master-work of wisdom, and one of the most
diffi cult chapters in the great art of living.’ Henri Amiel, Journal Intime, 21 Sept 1874.
Ageing is an inevitable and irreversible decline in organ function that occurs with
time, in the absence of injury or illness, and despite the existence of complex path-
ways of maintenance and repair.
Healthy ageing is the maintenance of physical and mental abilities that enable well-
being and independence in older age.
Do not presume ageing. Look for preventable and reversible pathology. Old age
does not cause disease (although it can increase vulnerability and recovery time).
Look for ways to reduce disability and support older people in their own homes.
Diff erences in the evaluation of the older person
1 Multiple pathologies: Elderly patients have, on average, six diagnosable disor-
ders. Eff ects may be multiplicative. Treatment must be integrated.
2 Multiple aetiologies: One problem may have several causes, eg falls. Treating
each alone may do little good, treating all may be of great benefi t.
3 Non-specifi c/atypical presentation: Delirium, dizziness, falls, mobility prob-
lems, weight loss, and incontinence can be due to disorders in more than one
organ system. Typical signs and symptoms may be absent. Ask about functional
decline in activities of daily living—this may be the only symptom.
4 Missed or delayed diagnosis: The older person may decline quickly if treat-
ment is delayed. Complications are common. Use a collateral history: what is the
patient usually like?
5 Pharmacy and polypharmacy: NSAIDS, anticoagulants, anti-parkinson drugs,
hypoglycaemic drugs, and psychoactive drugs can pose a particular risk in the
older patient. Double check for interactions. Consider body weight, liver and re-
nal function—drug doses may need to be modifi ed. The STOPP/START criteria detail
>100 potentially inappropriate prescriptions and prescribing omissions relevant
to the older patient.21
6 Prolonged recovery time: Anticipate and plan for this. Don’t forget nutrition.
7 Rehabilitation and social factors: Essential for healthy ageing.
A quick ward assessment of the older person
History: In addition to routine elements, include function in activities of daily liv-
ing, continence, and social support. Ask if there is an advanced care directive and
nominated proxy healthcare decision maker.
Examination:
• Appearance and aff ect: hygiene, nutrition, hydration. Briefl y assess mood.
• Senses: vision, hearing, assess swallowing with 20mL of water.
• Cognition: brief screening test, eg AMTS (p64), 2-step command.
• Pulse and blood pressure: lying/sitting and standing.
• Peripheral neurological exam: tone, power, wasting, active range of movement.
• Other periphery: pulses, oedema, skin integrity, pressure areas.
• Walking: stand patient, balance, transfers, observe gait (be ready to assist).
• Other systems: CV, respiratory, abdomen (don’t forget to palpate for bladder).22
Falls
50% aged >80 will fall at least once per year. Falls23 lead to injury, pain, distress, loss
of confi dence, loss of independence, and mortality. Cost to the NHS is £2.3bn/year.
• History: frequency, context and circumstances, severity, injuries.
• Multifactorial risk assessment: gait, balance, muscle strength, osteoporosis risk,
perceived functional ability, fear of falls, vision, cognition, neurological examina-
tion, continence, home and hazards, cardiovascular examination, medication re-
view.
• Interventions: strength and balance training, home hazard intervention, correct
vision, modifi cation/withdrawal of medication (cardiovascular, psychotropic), in-
tegrated management of contributing morbidities. Consider barriers to change,
eg fear, patient preference.

The pregnant woman 17
Pre-existing conditions and non-obstetric disease cause more maternal deaths in
the UK than obstetric complications.24
Pregnant women should receive the same investigations and treatment as non-preg-
nant patients, with avoidance of harm/potential harm to the fetus whenever possible.
Most mistakes made in the medical management of pregnant women are due to
acts of omission caused by inappropriate weighting of risk and benefi t.
Physiological changes in pregnancy
Clinical assessment in pregnancy requires knowledge of the physiological changes
associated with the gravid state. Expected changes and guidance on when to inves-
tigate for possible underlying pathology is given in table 1.3.
Table 1.3 Physiology and pathology in pregnancy
System Normal pregnancy Consider pathology

Radiology
If the uterus is positioned outside the imaging fi eld of view, the radiation dose to the
conceptus is minimal. Exposure from the following investigations is well below the
threshold of risk to the fetus:
• Plain radiograph: chest, extremities, spine.
• CT: head, chest (but consider radiation to maternal breast in pregnancy/lactation).
Ultrasound and MRI are preferentially used when imaging the abdomen.
Reassure your pregnant patient that a chest x-ray is safe. It is the equivalent of 3
days of background radiation. Do not presume it is not required—how else will you
pick up the widened mediastinum as a cause for her chest pain?
Drugs
For drugs prescribed in pregnancy, benefi t must be balanced against risk (table 1.4).
For information on drugs in lactation see: https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm.

Epidemiology
‘The work of epidemiology is related to unanswered questions, but also to un-
questioned answers.’ Patricia Buffl er, North American Congress of Epidemiology, 2011.
Who, what, when, where, why, and how?
Epidemiology is the study of the distribution of clinical phenomena in populations.
It analyses disease in terms of host, agent, and environment (the ‘epidemiologist’s
triad’). It elucidates risks and mechanisms for the development of disease, and re-
veals potential targets for disease prevention and treatment. Epidemiology does not
look at the individual patient, but examines a defi ned population. How applicable its
fi ndings are depend upon how well the sample population mirrors the study popula-
tion, which must, in turn, mirror the target population. Does your patient fi t in this
‘target’? If ‘yes’, then the epidemiological fi ndings may be applicable.
Measures of disease frequency
Incidence proportion is the number of new cases of disease as a proportion of
the population. Synonyms include probability of disease, cumulative incidence, risk.
Incidence rate is the number of new cases per unit of person-time, ie one person
observed for 5 years contributes 5 person-years of follow-up.
Prevalence is the number of cases that exist at a given time (point prevalence) or
time-frame (period prevalence), divided by the total population being studied. For
example, the lifetime prevalence of hiccups is ~100% and incidence is millions/year.
However, the point prevalence at 3am may be 0 if no one is actually having hiccups.
Comparisons of outcome frequency
Diff erences in outcome rates between populations point to an association between
the outcome and factors distinguishing the populations (eg a smoking population
compared to a non-smoking population). Challenges arise as populations tend to
diff er from each other in many ways, so it may not be clear which factor(s) aff ect
outcome frequency. This leads to confounding. For example, we might fi nd that
heart disease is more common in those who use walking sticks. But we cannot con-
clude that walking sticks cause heart disease as age is a confounding factor: age is
causal, not walking sticks.
Ways of accounting for associations: A may cause B (antacids cause cancer), B may
cause A (cancer causes antacid use), a 3rd unknown agent X (eg age) may cause A
and B, or the association may be a chance fi nding. When considering the options, it
is useful to bear in mind the Bradford Hill ‘criteria’ for causation (NB he did not claim
any were essential):
1 Consistency of fi ndings: among diff erent populations, studies, time periods.
2 Temporality: the eff ect must occur after the cause.
3 Biological gradient: a dose response whereby more exposure= more eff ect.
4 Specifi city: exposure causes a single outcome (smoking does not conform!).
5 Strength of association: strong associations are more likely to be causal.
6 Biological plausibility: there is a mechanism linking cause and eff ect.
7 Coherence: the relationship is supported by current disease knowledge.
8 Experiment: does removal of exposure reduce outcome frequency?
Epidemiological studies
Studies should be designed to give an adequate answer to a specifi c research ques-
tion. Samples need to be representative and of suffi cient size to answer the question.
Ecological studies: Outcome rates are examined in diff erent populations, eg trend
over time, geographically distinct groups, social class. Populations rather than indi-
viduals are the unit of study.
Longitudinal (cohort) studies: Subjects are followed over time with measurement
of exposure and outcome.
Case–control studies: Patients with the outcome of interest are identifi ed and past
exposure is assessed in comparison to ‘controls’ who did not develop the outcome.
Cases and controls should be adequately matched for other factors that may aff ect
outcome, or these diff erences should be corrected for (mathematical assumption).
Experimental studies: Exposure is allocated to a study group and compared to
those who are not exposed, eg randomized controlled trials.

Randomized controlled trials 19
In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants are allocated to an intervention/
exposure (eg new drug treatment) or no intervention (eg placebo, standard care) by
a process which equates to the fl ip of a coin, ie all participants have an equal chance
of being in either arm of the study. The aim is to minimize bias and attempt to get at
the truth as to whether the intervention is any good or not. Both groups are followed
up and analysed against predefi ned end-points.
Randomizing Done with the aim of eliminating the eff ects of non-studied factors.
With randomization (and suffi cient study size) the two arms of the study will be
identical (on average), with the exception of the intervention of interest.
Blinding There is a risk that factors during the trial may aff ect the outcome, eg
participant or clinician optimism if they know the patient is on active treatment, or
an unwillingness to expose more severe disease to placebo. If the subject does not
know which intervention they are having, the trial is single-blind. Ideally, the experi-
menter should not know either, and the study should be double-blind.
In a good trial, the blind lead the blind.
Journal club: how good is this RCT?
• Does the study answer a useful question? Does it add to current literature: big-
ger, better, diff erent target population?
• Does the target population in the study include your patient(s)? Check the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria including age and comorbidity.
• Is the intervention well described so it can be replicated in clinical practice?
• Was the sample size big enough to detect an eff ect? Can you fi nd a sample size
calculation? Watch out for sub-group analyses for which the sample size was
not calculated.
• Were outcome measures predefi ned?
• Is randomization adequate? Look at the baseline data for each group—are there
signifi cant diff erences? Are any parameters of interest (that might aff ect out-
come) not included?
• Who was blinded and how blind were they?
• Are statistical methods reported and appropriate? There should be a measure of
the eff ect size and its precision (confi dence interval, see p20).
• Is the eff ect clinically signifi cant? Watch out for surrogate end-points which do
not directly measure benefi t, harm, or the treatment response of interest.
• How long was the follow-up? Was it long enough to determine outcome?
• How complete was the follow-up? How many patients were left at the end of
the follow-up period? Were those who left the study included in the analysis
(intention-to-treat)?25
When a randomized controlled trial might not be the best method
• Generating new ideas beyond current paradigms (case reports).
• Researching causes of illnesses and prognoses (cohort studies).
• Evaluating diagnostic tests (cohort study and decision model).
• Where the researcher has no idea of the eff ective dose of a drug (dose-ranging
adaptive design).
• When recruiting of patients would be impossible or unethical.
• When personalized medicine is the aim, eg treatments matched to patients’ bio-
marker profi les (adaptive design, cohort study).
In the end, all randomized trials have to submit to the ultimate test when the sta-
tistical collides with the personal: ‘Will this treatment help me?’, ‘Will this procedure
help you?’ No randomized trial is complete until real-life decisions taken in the light
of its fi ndings are scrutinized. Remember Osler: ‘no two individuals react alike and
behave alike under the abnormal conditions which we know as disease. This is the
fundamental diffi culty of the physician’. Do not ask for defi nitive trials: everything
is provisional.

Medical mathematics
‘When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind.’
Lord Kelvin, 1883.
Comparison measures
Comparisons between ‘exposed’ and ‘unex-Table 1.5 2≈2 table analysis

ated by plotting a 2≈2 table (table 1.5). Yes 70 20 90
• Absolute risk difference (attributable risk)

= disease frequency in exposed minus the
disease frequency in unexposed. Example Total 190 470
(table 1.5): (70/90) Ω (120/570) = 0.57  exposure increases risk by 57%.
• Relative risk = ratio of outcome in exposed population compared to unexposed.
Relative risk of 1 means risk is same in both populations. Relative risk >1 means ex-
posure increases risk. Relative risk <1 means exposure lessens risk, eg vaccination.
Example (table 1.5): (70/90)÷(120/570) = 3.69  risk is 3.69 ≈ higher with exposure.
• Odds ratio = ratio of the probability of an outcome occurring compared to the
probability of an outcome not occurring. Example (table 1.5): (70/20)÷(120/450) =
13.13  odds of outcome are 13.13 ≈ higher with exposure.
Relative risk is easier to interpret than odds ratio but relies on a meaningful preva-
lence/incidence. For the individual, absolute risk diff erence may be most relevant.
P-values and confi dence intervals
In a study of two groups (eg new treatment versus placebo), it is possible that
there is no diff erence (ie new treatment has no benefi t). This is the null hypothesis.
A p-value measures the strength of evidence in relation to the null hypothesis:
• Low p-value: data unlikely if null hypothesis is true.
• High p-value: data likely is null hypothesis is true.
A p-value is not the probability that your results occurred by chance, and it can-
not tell you how good a study is. There will be many assumptions in the statistical
model. Look at the details: have confounding or bias aff ected the result? Do not
consider p <0.05 as ‘statistically signifi cant’: a small p-value just fl ags the data
as unusual.26 You need to question why and decide if this is clinically important.
Confi dence intervals (CI) give a guide to the eff ect size and direction (eg benefi t/
harm). They give a margin of error that indicates the amount of uncertainty in the
statistical estimate.
Assessing validity
The validity of a test which dichotomizes study participants can be assessed by
examining the results from the test against a standard reference (or outcome: did
the participant actually have the disease?) (see table 1.6).
Sensitivity TP/(TP + FN) = of those with the condition, how many test positive? A sensi-
tive test is able to correctly identify those with the disease.
Specifi city TN/(TN + FP) = of those who do not have the condition, how many test
negative? A specifi c test is able to correctly identify those without a disease.
‘Do they have abdominal pain?’ as a test for appendicitis will have sensitivity (most
cases have pain), but specifi city (many patients with pain do not have appendicitis).
Positive predictive value (TP/(TP + FP) indicates how likely it is that someone with a
positive test result has the condition.
Negative predictive value (TN/(TN + FN) indicates how likely it is that someone with a
negative test result does not have the condition. When you receive a test result, you
need to know how likely it is to be correct.
Table 1.6 Table of possible test results
Test result Patient has condition Patient does not have condition
Positive True positive (TP) False positive (FP)
Negative False negative (FN) True negative (TN)

Number needed to treat
21
Number needed to treat (NNT) is a useful way of reporting the results of randomized
clinical trials. It is the reciprocal of the absolute risk diff erence: 1 ÷ ARR.
A large treatment eff ect means that fewer patients need to receive treatment in
order for one to benefi t. It is specifi c to the chosen comparator (eg placebo or usual
care), the measured outcome (eg death, blood pressure fall), and the duration of
treatment follow-up used in the study. Look carefully at the details of the question
that the NNT is attempting to quantify.
• Advantages: easily calculated, single numerical value for effi cacy, can be used to
examine harm (becomes the number needed to harm).
• Disadvantages: confi dence intervals are diffi cult when the diff erences between
treatments are not signifi cant.
The doctor as a gambler
Yes or No? Your tutor asks whether Gobble’s disease is commoner in women or
men. You have no idea, and make a guess. What is the chance of getting it right?
Common sense decrees that you have a 50:50 chance. Sod’s law predicts that
whatever you guess, you will always be wrong. Somewhere between the two is
Damon Runyon’s view that ‘all life is 6 to 5 against’: Will you pick the right answer?
Perhaps, but don’t bet on it!
New or existing disease? Suppose singultus is a rare symptom of Gobble’s dis-
ease (seen in 5% of patients), but that it is a very common symptom of Kobble’s
disease (seen in 90%). If we have a man whom we already know has Gobble’s
disease, who goes on to develop singultus, is it more likely to be due to Kobble’s,
rather than Gobble’s disease? The answer is usually no: it is generally the case that
most symptoms are due to a disease that is already known, and do not imply a
new disease (Occam’s razor, p4). The ‘odds ratio’ makes this clearer, ie the ratio
of [the probability of the symptom, given the known disease] to [the probability
of the symptom due to new disease ≈ the probability of developing the new dis-
ease]. Usually this is vastly in favour of the symptom being due to the old disease,
because of the prior odds of the two diseases. This will work until Kobble’s dis-
ease increases in prevalence so as to increase the odds of a second disease (then
Hickam trumps Occam, p4).
How to play the odds It is distasteful to think that doctors can gamble with
patients’ lives. It is also distasteful to think of serious diseases being ‘missed’, and
invasive procedures being done unnecessarily. Yet we do not have an evidence
base or an experience base which can tell us defi nitively which cough or lethargy
or sore toe is just ‘one of those things’, and which is the result of undiagnosed
cancer or HIV or osteomyelitis. And so we gamble.
Medicine is not for pessimists—almost anything can be made to seem fatal, so
that a pessimistic doctor would never get any sleep at night due to worry about
the meaning of their patients’ symptoms. Medicine is not for blind optimists either,
who too easily embrace a fool’s paradise of false reassurance. Rather, medicine is
for informed gamblers: gamblers who are happy to use subtle clues to change their
outlook from pessimism to optimism and vice versa. Sometimes the gambling is
scientifi c, rational, methodical, and reproducible (odds ratio); sometimes it instinc-
tual, due to clinical intuition (vital but ill-defi ned).
Of course, gambling inevitably results in losses, and in medicine the chips are
not just fi nancial. They betoken the health of your patient, your reputation, and
your confi dence. Perhaps the hardest part of medicine is the inevitability of making
mistakes whilst attempting to help (see ‘Being wrong’, p5). But do not worry about
gambling: gambling is your job. If you cannot gamble, you cannot walk the thin line
between successfully addressing health needs, and causing over-medicalization
(p23). But try hard to assemble suffi cient evidence to maximize the chances of
being lucky. Lucky gambling is a requisite for successful doctoring and the casino
of medical practice celebrates the card counter. But the cardinal clinical virtue
is courage: without it we would not follow our hunches and take justifi ed risks.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM)
EBM is the conscientious and judicious use of current, best research evidence to opti-
mize management plans and integrate them with patients’ values by:
1 Asking answerable questions.
2 Finding the best information.
3 Appraising the information for quality, validity, and relevance.
4 Dialogue to fi nd out what the patient wants.
5 Applying data to patient care.
6 Evaluation.
The amount of evidence
More than 2 million new biomedical papers are published each year including >20 000
new randomized trials. Patients benefi t directly from a tiny fraction of these papers.
How do we fi nd them?
• A hierarchy of evidence
(fi g 1.3) is used to identify
the best research available
to answer our question.
• Specialist EBM journals,
eg Evidence-based Med-
icine, appraise published
information for quality,
relevance, and interest on
our behalf.
• The Cochrane Collabora-
tion gathers and summa-
rizes best evidence, free
from commercial spon-
sorship and confl icts of

contribute.
Problems:
• The concept of scientifi c rigour is opaque. What do we want? The science, the
rigour, the truth, or what will be most useful to patients? These may overlap, but
they are not the same. Can average cohort results inform clinical decisions on an
individual level (especially in the context of comorbidity)?
• Can we really appraise ALL the evidence? 27 We are hindered by publication bias.
Around half of all clinical trials remain unpublished. See www.alltrials.net for the cam-
paign to register all trials, and ensure methods and summary results are available.
• Evidence can be expensive. Who paid the bill and what is their vested interest?
• Is the result clinically signifi cant? What is the level of benefi t to the individual, as
opposed to the population? Is the EBM tail wagging the clinical dog?
• How is our innate hierarchy of evidence constructed? Do we maintain the same
standard of the evidence for all changes to our practice?
• Have you checked the correspondence columns in journals from which winning
papers are extracted? It may take years for unforeseen fl aws to surface.
• There is a danger that by always asking, ‘What is the evidence?’, we will divert
resources from hard-to-prove areas (eg psychosocial interventions).
• EBM is never 100% up to date and reworking meta-analyses takes time and mon-
ey. Specialists may ostensibly reject a new trial due to a tiny fl aw, when the real
dread is that it might fl ip their once-perfect formulation.
• EBM lies uncomfortably in a world of clinical intuition and instinctual premoni-
tion. Yet these instincts may be vital.
• If EBM is prescriptive, patient choice declines. Does our zeal for EBM make us ar-
rogant, mechanical, and defensive? Where is the shared decision-making (p7)?
• By focusing on answerable questions, EBM can distract us from our patients’ un-
answerable questions; questions that still require time and acknowledgement.
The practice of EBM must be informed by clinical judgement and compassion.

Medicalization 23
Using Illness as a Metaphor,8 Susan Sontag describes two kingdoms: that of the
well, and that of the sick. She describes our dual citizenship, and the use of a pass-
port to travel from one kingdom to the other. But medicalization blurs this distinc-
tion. The boundary between the ‘Kingdom of the Sick’ and the ‘Kingdom of Well’ is
lost and there is an anschluss of healthy people annexed into the potentially preda-
tory and frightening kingdom of the sick from which there may well be no escape.
‘Too much medicine’ occurs as a result of:
• Overdiagnosis: Labelling an (asymptomatic) person as ‘sick’ despite the fact that
subsequent treatment, lifestyle advice, or monitoring provides no benefi t to their
outcome (and potentially causes harm), eg non-progressive breast cancer.
• Overdetection: Increasingly sensitive tests identify pathology that is indolent or
non-progressive, eg subsegmental pulmonary emboli diagnosed on CT angiography.
• Overdefi niton: Expansion of disease defi nitions or lowering of disease thresholds,
eg an eGFR diagnosis of chronic kidney disease now means that 1 in 8 adults are
labelled with the disease, many of whom will never progress to symptomatic kid-
ney failure; 15% of pregnant women now have subclinical hypothyroidism without
evidence that thyroxine replacement is benefi cial (2016).
• Disease mongering: The creation of pseudodiseases which pose no threat to
health, eg restless legs, sexual health dysfunction, multiple chemical sensitivity.
• Overutilization: Healthcare practice that provides no net benefi t, eg routine MRI
for lower back pain.
• Overtreatment: Treatment that is of no benefi t (and may cause harm), eg antibiot-
ics for viral infections, polypill for the population.
Too much medicine arises from the fear of missing a diagnosis, and concern about
avoidable morbidity or mortality. A punitive society means there is a perceived need
for more tests, to seek more certainty. But certainty is the holy grail of myth and
legend. The individual patient is a unique set of symptoms, stoicism, experience, and
need. And by the nature of life, all cure can only ever be temporary.
Choosing wisely
CHOOSING WISELY is an initiative to change doctors’ practice away from interventions
that are not:
• supported by evidence
• free from harm
• truly necessary (including duplicative tests).
The top 5–10 interventions that should not be used routinely are given for each spe-
cialty. Search for those relevant to your current post at: www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-
patient-lists/.
Screening
Consider medicalization when screening for disease. Remember all screening
programmes do harm, some do good. The Wilson criteria for screening lists the
important features necessary for a screening programme and the mnemonic
IATROGENIC reminds of our pressing duty to do no harm:
1 The condition screened for should be an important one.
2 There should be an acceptable treatment for the disease.
3 Diagnostic andt reatment facilities should be available.
4 Ar ecognizable latent or early symptomatic stage is required.
5 Opinions on who to treat must be agreed.
6 The test must be good: high discriminatory power, valid, and reproducible
with safety guaranteed.
7 Thee xamination must be acceptable to the patient.
8 The untreatedn atural history of the disease must be known.
9 It should bei nexpensive.
10 Screening must be continuous (ie not a ‘one-off ’ aff air).

Advice and experience
1 The way to learn physical signs is at the bedside, with guidance from a senior doc-
tor or an experienced colleague. This chapter is not a substitute for this process: it
is simply an aide-memoire both on the wards and when preparing for exams.
2 We ask questions to get information to help with diff erential diagnosis. But we
also ask questions to fi nd out about the lives our patients live so that we can
respect them as individuals. The patient is likely to notice and reciprocate this
respect, and the rapport that you build with your patient in this way is a key com-
ponent to diagnosing and managing their disease.
3 Patients (and diseases) rarely read textbooks, so don’t be surprised that some
symptoms are ambiguous, and others meaningless. Get good at recognizing pat-
terns, but not so good that you create them when none exist. We all fall into this
trap!
4 Signs can be easy to detect, or subtle. Some will be found by all the new medical
students, others require experienced ears or eyes. Remember, you can be a fi ne
doctor without being able to elicit every sign.1 However, fi nding signs and put-
ting together the clues they give us to fi nd a diagnosis is one of the best parts of
being a doctor. It is also essential that we learn those signs that highlight diseases
we should never miss. However, in an exam, if you cannot fi nd a sign, never be
tempted to make up something you think should be there. If the examiner is push-
ing you to describe something you cannot see, be honest and admit you cannot
see it. Learning is a lifelong process, and nobody becomes a consultant overnight.
Developing your own routine
While on the acute medical or surgical take you will ‘clerk’ countless numbers of
patients. This involves taking a full history: history-taking may seem deceptively
easy, as if the patient knew the hard facts and the only problem was extracting
them; but what a patient says is a mixture of hearsay (‘She said I looked very pale’),
innuendo (‘You know, doctor, down below’), legend (‘I suppose I bit my tongue; it
was a real fi t, you know’), exaggeration (‘I didn’t sleep a wink’), and improbabilities
(‘The Pope put a transmitter in my brain’). The great skill (and pleasure) in taking
a history lies not in ignoring these garbled messages, but in making sense of them.
Next you will likely perform all the core examinations (cardiovascular, respiratory,
abdominal, and neurological) and any relevant additional ones (eg breast, thyroid,
peripheral vascular). No two doctors will have identical examination techniques.
Relish this variation as it helps you craft your own routine.
An insightful student
Having a template for the all-important history and examination is no more than a
rough guide and you must fl esh it out with your own learning. We start out nerv-
ous of missing some question or sign, but what we should really be nervous about
is losing our humanity in the hurly-burly of a time-pressed interview. Here is how
one student put some fl esh on the bones—for a man in a wheelchair: she asked
all about the presenting complaint, and how it fi tted in with his CNS condition and
life at home—and then found out that his daughter had had a nervous breakdown
at the start of his illness, 5 years ago. ‘How is she now?’ she asked. ‘Fine—I’ve got
two lovely grand children…Jim is just learning to walk…’ ‘Oh…you must be so busy!’
the student said with a joyful smile. This man had not been busy for 5 years, and
was fed up with his passive dependency. The thought of being busy again made
his face light up—and when the student left he rose up out of his wheelchair to
shake her by the hand, a movement we doctors thought was impossible. Jim and
his grandfather were learning to walk, but this student was up and running—far
ahead of her teachers.

Taking a history
Taking a good history is an art and an essential skill: 80% of diagnoses should be
made on history alone, with the signs you elicit adding an extra 10% and tests only
giving the fi nal 5% or so. Do not rely on signs or investigations for your diagnosis,
but use them rather to confi rm what you suspected. Try to put the patient at ease: a
good rapport may relieve distress. Introduce yourself and check whether the patient
is comfortable. Be conversational rather than interrogative. Start with open ques-
tions, allow the patient to tell their story, but if they stray off topic, gently steer them
back towards the important points.
Presenting complaint (PC) Open questions: ‘Why have you come to see me today?’
Record the patient’s own words rather than medical terms.
History of presenting complaint (HPC) When did it start? What was the fi rst
thing noticed? Progress since then. Ever had it before? ‘SOCRATES’ questions: site;
onset (gradual, sudden); character; radiation; associations (eg nausea, sweating);
timing of pain/duration; exacerbating and alleviating factors; severity (eg scale of
1–10, compared with worst ever previous pain). Direct questioning (to narrow list of
possible diagnoses). Specifi c or ‘closed’ questions about the diff erential diagnoses
you have in mind (+risk factors, eg travel—p414) and a review of the relevant system.
Past medical history (PMH) Ever in hospital? Illnesses? Operations? Ask specifi -
cally about MIJTHREADS: MI, jaundice, TB, high BP, rheumatic fever, epilepsy, asthma,
diabetes, stroke, anaesthetic problems.
Drug history (DH) Any tablets, injections, ‘over-the-counter’ drugs, herbal remedies,
oral contraceptives? Ask about allergies and what the patient experienced, eg may
be an intolerance (nausea, diarrhoea), or may have been a minor reaction of sensiti-
zation (eg rash and wheeze) before full-blown anaphylaxis.
Social history (SH) Probe without prying. ‘Who else is there at home?’ Job. Marital
status. Spouse’s job and health. Housing—any stairs at home? Who visits—relatives,
neighbours, GP, nurse? Are there any dependants at home? Mobility—any walking
aids needed? Who does the cooking and shopping? What can the patient not do be-
cause of the illness? Ask about occupation, hobbies, sport, exercise, and ethnic origin.
The social history is all too often seen as a dispensable adjunct but vital clues may
be missed about the quality of life and it is too late to ask when the surgeon’s hand is
deep in the belly and they are wondering how radical a procedure to perform. Utilize
the GP’s knowledge of the patient: they may have known them and/or their family for
decades. He or she may even hold a ‘living will’ or advance directive if they cannot
speak for themselves. Tactfully ask about alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs.
How much? How long? When stopped? 1 unit = 8g of ethanol = 1 spirits measure = 1/2
glass of wine = 1/3 pint of beer. The CAGE questionnaire is a useful screening test for
alcoholism (p281). Quantify smoking in terms of pack-years: 20 cigarettes/day for 1
year equals 1 pack-year. We all like to present ourselves well, so be inclined to double
stated quantities (Holt’s ‘law’).
Family history (FH) Areas of the family history may need detailed questioning, eg
to determine if there is a signifi cant family history of heart disease you need to ask
about the health of the patient’s grandfathers and male siblings, smoking, tendency
to hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, and claudication before they were 60 years old, as
well as ascertaining the cause of death. Ask about TB, diabetes, and other relevant
diseases. Draw a family tree (see BOX). Be tactful when asking about a family
history of malignancy.
Systemic enquiry (See p30.) Helps uncover undeclared symptoms. Some of this
may already have been incorporated into the history.
 Always enquire, without sounding robotic, if your patient has any ideas of what
the problem might be, if he/she has any particular concerns or expectations, and
give him/her an opportunity to ask you questions or tell you anything you may
have missed.
Don’t hesitate to review the history later: recollections change (as you will fi nd,
often on the post-take ward round when the Consultant is asking the questions!).

Drawing family trees to reveal dominantly inherited disease
Advances in genetics are touching all branches of medicine. It is increasingly im-
portant for doctors to identify patients at high risk of genetic disease, and to make
appropriate referrals. The key skill is drawing a family tree to help you structure
a family history as follows:
1 Start with your patient. Draw a square for a male and a circle for a female. Add
a small arrow (see fi g 2.2) to show that this person is the propositus (the person
through whom the family tree is ascertained).
2 Add your patient’s parents, brothers, and sisters. Record basic information only,
eg age, and if alive and well (a&w). If dead, note age and cause of death, and
pass an oblique stroke through that person’s symbol.
3 Ask the key question ‘Has anybody else in your family had a similar problem
as yourself?’, eg heart attack/angina/stroke/cancer. Ask only about the family
of diseases that relate to your patient’s main problem. Do not record a potted
medical history for each family member: time is too short.
4 Extend the family tree upwards to include grandparents. If you haven’t revealed
a problem by now, go no further—you are unlikely to miss important familial
disease. If your patient is elderly it may be impossible to obtain good informa-
tion about grandparents. If so, fi ll out the family tree with your patient’s uncles
and aunts on both the mother’s and father’s sides.
5 Shade those in the family tree aff ected by the disease. • = an aff ected female;
 = an aff ected male. This helps to show any genetic problem and, if there is one,
will help demonstrate the pattern of inheritance.
6 If you have identifi ed a familial susceptibility, or your patient has a recognized
genetic disease, extend the family tree down to include children, to identify
others who may be at risk and who may benefi t from screening. You should
fi nd out who is pregnant in the family, or may soon be, and arrange appropriate
genetic counselling (OHCS p154). Refer for genetics opinion.
The family tree (fi g 2.2) shows these ideas at work and indicates that there is
evidence for genetic risk of colon cancer, meriting referral to a geneticist. N.B: use
a diff erent approach in paediatrics, and for autosomal or sex-linked disease. Ask if
parents are related (consanguinity risk of recessive diseases).

Symptoms
Symptoms are features which patients report. Physical signs are elicited at the
bedside. Together, they constitute the features of the condition in that patient.
Their evolution over time and interaction with the physical, psychological, and social
spheres comprise the natural history of any disease. Throughout this chapter, we
discuss symptoms in isolation and attempt to classify them into a ‘system’ or present
them in the following BOXES as ‘non-specifi c’. This is unnatural but a good fi rst step in
learning how to diagnose. All doctors have to know about symptoms and their relief.
Part of becoming a good doctor is learning to link symptoms together, to identify
those that may be normal, and those that are worrying. There are many online tools
and books that can help with this, but there is no substitute for experience. If you
aren’t sure, ask a specialist in that area for advice.
The following are common ‘non-specifi c’ presentations.
Itch
Itching (pruritus) Common and, if chronic, most unpleasant.
Table 2.1 Aetiology of pruritus
Local causes Systemic (do FBC, ESR, glucose, LFT, U&E, ferritin, TFT)
Eczema, atopy, urticaria Liver disease (bile salts, eg PBC) Old age; pregnancy
Scabies Uraemia (eg CKD) Drugs (eg morphine)
Lichen planus Malignancy (eg lymphoma) Diabetes mellitus
Dermatitis herpetiformis Polycythaemia rubra vera Thyroid disease
Spinal cord tumours (rare)2 Iron defi ciency anaemia HIV infection
Questions: Wheals (urticaria)? Worse at night? Others aff ected (scabies)? What
provokes it? After a bath ≈ polycythaemia rubra vera (p366). Exposure, eg to ani-
mals (atopy?) or fi bre glass (irritant eczema?).
See table 2.1. Look for local causes: Scabies burrows in fi nger webs, lice on hair
shafts, knee and elbow blisters (dermatitis herpetiformis). Systemic: Splenomeg-
aly, nodes, jaundice, fl ushed face, or thyroid signs? : Treat causes; try soothing
bland emollients ± emollient bath oils ± sedative antihistamines at night, eg chlor-
phenamine 4mg PO.
‘Off -legs’—falls and diffi culty walking
Common causes of admission in the elderly, and can lead to loss of confi dence and
independence. Causes are often multifactorial:
Intrinsic: Typically osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis, but remember fractured neck
of femur, CNS disease,  vision, cognitive impairment, depression, postural hypoten-
sion, periph eral neuropathy, medication (eg antihypertensives, sedatives), pain,
eg arthritis, parkinsonism (eg drugs: prochlorperazine, neuroleptics, metoclopra-
mide), muscle weakness (consider vitamin D defi ciency), incontinence, UTI, pneu-
monia, anaemia, hypothyroidism, renal impairment, hypothermia, and alcohol.
Environ ment: Poor lighting, uneven walking surface. Treatment includes address-
ing injuries, reducing risk factors, and reducing the risk of injury, eg treat osteopo-
rosis (p682). A multidisciplinary multifactorial approach alongside occupational
therapists and physiotherapists is likely to be benefi cial. See gait disorders, p467.
If there is ataxia, the cause is not always alcohol: other chemicals may be involved
(eg cannabis or prescribed sedatives). There may be a metastatic or non-meta-
static manifestation of malignancy, or a cerebellar lesion.
Bilateral weak legs may suggest a cord lesion: see p466. If there is associated
urinary or faecal incontinence ± saddle anaesthesia or lower limb sensory loss,
urgent imaging (MRI) and treatment for cord compression may well be needed.

Fatigue
So common that it is a variant of normality. Only 1 in 400 episodes of fatigue leads
to visiting the doctor. Don’t miss depression (p15). Even if depressed, still rule out
common treatable causes—eg anaemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes. After history
and examination: FBC, ESR, U&E, plasma glucose, TFT, ± CXR. Follow up to see what
develops, and to address emotional problems. Take a sleep history.
Fevers, rigors, sweats
While some night sweating is common in anxiety, drenching sweats requiring
changes of night-clothes are a more ominous symptom associated with infection
(eg TB, brucellosis), lymphoproliferative disease, or other malignancies. Patterns
of fever may be relevant (see p442).
Rigors are uncontrolled paroxysms of shivering which occur as a patient’s tem-
perature rises rapidly.
Sweating excessively (hyperhidrosis) may be primary (eg hidradenitis sup-
purativa may be very distressing to the patient)—or secondary to fever, pain or
anxiety (cold & sweaty) or a systemic condition: the menopause, hyperthyroidism
(warm & sweaty), acromegaly, malignancy, phaeochromocytoma, amyloidosis, or
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (+hyper thermia). Or it may refl ect gabapentin
or opiate withdrawal, or a choline r gic or parasympathomimetic side-eff ect (ami-
triptyline, bethanechol, distigmine, spider bites)—also hormonal drugs, eg levo-
thyroxine, gonadorelin or somatostatin analogu es, vasopressin, and ephedrine. Also
amiodarone, ciprofl oxacin, levodopa, lisinopril, rivastigmine, ritonavir, pioglitazone,
venlafaxine. At the bedside: ask about all drugs, examine all over for nodes; any
signs of hyperthyroidism? Any splenom egaly? Test the urine; do T°, ESR, TSH, FBC, &
blood culture. : Antiperspirants (aluminium chloride 20%=Driclor®), sympathec-
tomy, or iontophoresis may be tried.
Insomnia
This is trivial—until we ourselves have a few sleepless nights. Then sleep becomes
the most desirable thing imaginable, and bestowing it the best thing we can do,
like relieving pain. But don’t give drugs without looking for a cause.
• Self-limiting: Jet lag; stress; shift work; in hospital. We need less sleep as we age.
• Psychic: Depression; anxiety; mania; grief; psychomotor agitation/psychosis.
• Organic: Drugs (many; eg caff eine; mefl oquine; nicotine withdrawal); nocturia;
alcohol; pain (eg acid refl ux—worse on lying down); itch; tinnitus; asthma; dys-
tonias; obstructive sleep apnoea (p194); dementia; restless leg syndrome (p698,
check ferritin). Rarer: encephalitis (eg West Nile virus) and encephalopathy
(Whipple’s; pellagra; HIV; prion diseases, eg CJD, p696, and fatal familial insomnia).
:Sleep hygiene. No daytime naps; don’t turn in till you feel sleepy; regular bed-
time routines. Keep a room for sleep; don’t eat or work in it (not viable for much
of the world). Less caff eine, nicotine, late exercise (but sexual activity may give
excellent torpor!), and alcohol (its abuse causes paradoxical pro-adrenergic trem-
or and insomnia). Try monitoring quality with a sleep diary (unless already over-
obsessive). Music and relaxation may make sleep more restorative and augment
personal resources.
Hypnotic drugs. Give for a few nights only (addictive and cause daytime somno-
lence ± rebound insomnia on stopping). Warn about driving/machine use. Exam-
ple: zopiclone 3.75–7.5mg. Obstructive sleep apnoea, p194. Parasomnias, sleep
paralysis, etc. OHCS p371. Narcolepsy, p700.

Systemic enquiry
Just as skilled acrobats are happy to work without safety nets, so experienced clini-
cians may operate without the functional enquiry. But to do this you must be experi-
enced enough to understand all the nuances of the presenting complaint.
General questions
May be the most signifi cant, eg in TB, endocrine problems, or cancer:
• Weight loss.
• Night sweats.
• Any lumps.
• Fatigue/malaise/lethargy.
• Sleeping pattern.1
• Appetite.
• Fevers.
• Itch or rash.
• Recent trauma.
Cardiorespiratory symptoms
• Chest pain (p94).
• Exertional dyspnoea (=breathlessness): quantify exercise tolerance and how it has
changed, eg stairs climbed, or distance walked, before onset of breathlessness.
• Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). Orthopnoea, ie breathlessness on lying fl at
(a symptom of left ventricular failure): quantify in terms of number of pillows the
patient must sleep on to prevent dyspnoea.
• Oedema: ankles, legs, lower back (dependent areas).
• Palpitations (awareness of heartbeats): can they tap out the rhythm?
• Cough: sputum, haemoptysis (coughing up blood).
• Wheeze.
Gastrointestinal symptoms
• Abdominal pain (constant or colicky, sharp or dull; site; radiation; duration; onset;
severity; relationship to eating and bowel action; alleviating or exacerbating, or
associated features).
• Other questions—think of symptoms throughout the GI tract, from mouth to anus:
• Swallowing (p250).
• Indigestion (p252).
• Nausea/vomiting; blood? (p250).
• Bowel habit (p258 & p260).
• Stool: colour, consistency, blood, mucus; diffi culty fl ushing away (p266); tenes-
mus or urgency.
Tenesmus is the feeling of incomplete evacuation of the bowels (eg due to a tumour
or irritable bowel syndrome). Haematemesis is vomiting blood. Melaena is altered
(black) blood passed PR (p256), with a characteristic off ensive smell and tar like
appearance.
Genitourinary symptoms
• Incontinence (stress or urge, p648).
• Dysuria (painful micturition).
• Urinary abnormalities: colour? Haematuria (streaks or pink urine?) Frothy?
• Nocturia (needing to micturate at night).
• Frequency (frequent micturition) or polyuria (the frequent passing of large vol-
umes of urine).
• Hesitancy (diffi culty starting micturition).
• Terminal dribbling.
• Vaginal discharge (colour, odour); pain on intercourse (dyspareunia) (p412).
• Menses: frequency, regularity, heavy or light, duration, painful? First day of last
menstrual period (LMP). Number of pregnancies and births. Menarche. Menopause.
Any chance of pregnancy now?
1 Too sleepy? Think of myxoedema or narcolepsy. Early waking? Think of depression. Being woken by pain is
always a serious sign. For the signifi cance of the other questions listed here, see Chapter 3.

Neurological symptoms
• Special senses: sight, hearing, smell, and taste.
• Seizures, faints, ‘funny turns’.
• Headache.
• ‘Pins and needles’ (paraesthesiae) or numbness.
• Limb weakness (‘Are your arms and legs weaker than normal?’), poor balance.
• Speech problems (p86).
• Sphincter disturbance.
• Higher mental function and psychiatric symptoms (p86–p89). The important thing
is to assess function: what the patient can and cannot do at home, work, etc.
Musculoskeletal symptoms
• Pain, stiff ness, swelling of joints.
• Diurnal variation in symptoms (ie worse in mornings).
• Functional defi cit.
• Signs of systemic disease: rashes, mouth ulcers, nasal stuffi ness, malaise, and con-
stitutional symptoms.
Thyroid symptoms
• Hyperthyroidism: Prefers cold weather, bad tempered, sweaty, diarrhoea, oli-
gomenorrhoea, weight (though often appetite), tremor, palpitations, visual prob-
lems.
• Hypothyroidism: Depressed, slow, tired, thin hair, croaky voice, heavy periods, con-
stipation, dry skin, prefers warm weather.

Physical examination
The physical examination is not so much an extension of the history, but more of the
fi rst investigation, to confi rm, exclude, defi ne, or show the progress of the provi-
sional diagnosis as revealed in the history. Even in the emergency department where
the history may be brief, eg ‘trauma’, the examination is to confi rm a fracture, or to
decide that a fracture is less likely. The examination sheds further light on the his-
tory. As you get better, your physical examination gets briefer. Establish your own
routine—practice is the key.
End of the bed
• Look at the patient—are they well or in extremis? What makes you think this?
Are they in pain? If so, does it make them lie still (eg peritonitis) or writhe about
(eg colic)? What is the pattern of breathing: laboured; rapid; shallow; irregular;
distressed? Are they obese or cachectic? Is their behaviour appropriate? Can you
detect any unusual smell, eg hepatic fetor (p274), cigarettes, alcohol?
• Also take a moment to look around the bed for other clues, eg inhalers, insulin
administration kit, walking aids, etc.
Face and body habitus
• Does the patient’s appearance suggest any particular diseases, eg acromegaly, thy-
rotoxicosis, myxoedema, Cushing’s syndrome, or hypopituitarism? See p202.
• Is there an abnormal distribution of body hair (eg bearded , or hairless ) sug-
gestive of endocrine disease?
• Is there anything about the patient to trigger thoughts about Paget’s disease, Mar-
fan’s, myotonia, or Parkinson’s syndrome? Look for rashes, eg the malar fl ush of
mitral disease and the butterfl y rash of SLE.
Peripheral stigmata of disease
Specifi c signs are associated with diff erent diseases: consider the nails (koilonychia
= iron defi ciency), subcutaneous nodules (rheumatoid, neurofi broma?), and look for
lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal). See specifi c systems for features to assess
for, but for all systems consider:
Skin colour:
• Blue/purple = cyanosis (can also be central only, p34).
• Yellow = jaundice (yellow skin can also be caused by uraemia, pernicious anaemia,
carotenaemia—check the sclera: if they are also yellow it is jaundice).
• Pallor: this is non-specifi c; anaemia is assessed from the palmar skin creases (when
spread) and conjunctivae (fi g 8.3)—usually pale if Hb <80–90g/L: you cannot con-
clude anything from normal conjunctival colour, but if they are pale, the patient is
probably anaemic.
• Hyperpigmentation: Addison’s, haemoc hromatosis (slate-grey) and amiodarone,
gold, silver, and minocycline therapy.
Charts:
• Temperature: varies during the day; a morning oral temperature >37.2°C or evening
>37.7°C constitutes a fever.3 Rectal temperatures are generally 0.6°C above oral
temperatures. Remember that temperatures are generally lower in elderly patients
and therefore fevers may not be as pronounced.4 A core temperature <35°C indi-
cates hypothermia; special low-reading thermometers may be required.
• Blood pressure and pulse—trends are more important than one-off values; repeat
if concerned.
• Urine: check urinalysis and input/output charts if available.
Fluid status When admitting an unwell patient, don’t forget to assess their hydra-
tion, check skin turgor and mucous membranes, look for sunken eyes, and check
capillary refi ll (if well perfused <2s) and JVP.

Unexplained signs and symptoms: how to refer for an opinion
When you don’t know: ask. If you are wondering if you should ask: ask.
Frequently, the skills needed for diagnosis or treatment will lie beyond the team
you are working for, so, during ward rounds, agree who should be asked for an
opinion. You will be left with the job of making the arrangements, so check before
your senior leaves exactly what their question is. Don’t be intimidated, but follow
these simple rules:
• Know the history and examination fi ndings (ideally your own), and have the pa-
tient’s notes, observations, recent test results, and drug charts to hand (table 2.2).
• At the outset, state if you are just looking for advice or if you are asking if the
patient could be seen. Make it clear exactly what the question is that you want
addressed, allowing the listener to focus their thoughts and ask relevant questions.
• Give the patient’s age and run through a brief history including relevant past
medical history. If you would like the patient to be seen, give warning if they will
be leaving the ward for a test at a particular time.
• The visiting doctor may be unfamiliar with your ward. When he or she arrives
introduce yourself, get the notes and charts, and give your contact details in case
they have further questions.

Anaesthetics Previous anaesthetic? Reaction? Last ate/drank?

Signs
The following signs are not specifi c to a particular system:
Cyanosis
Dusky blue skin (peripheral—of the fi ngers) or mucosae (central—of the tongue),
representing 50g/L of Hb in its reduced (hence hypoxic) form, it occurs more readily
in polycythaemia than anaemia.
Causes:
• Lung disease with inadequate oxygen transfer, eg luminal obstruction, asthma,
COPD, pneumonia, PE, pulmonary oedema—may be correctable by  inspired O2.
• Congenital cyanotic heart disease, where there is a mixture, eg transposition of
the great arteries or right-to-left shunt (eg VSD with Eisenmenger’s syndrome; see
p156)—cyanosis is not reversed by increasing inspired oxygen.
• Rare causes—methaemoglobinaemia, a congenital or acquired red cell disorder.
Acute cyanosis is an emergency. Is there asthma, an inhaled foreign body, a pneu-
mothorax (p749, fi g 1) or pulmonary oedema? See p814.
Peripheral cyanosis will occur in causes of central cyanosis, but may also be induced
by changes in the peripheral and cutaneous vascular systems in patients with nor-
mal oxygen saturations. It occurs in the cold, in hypovolaemia, and in arterial disease,
and is, therefore, not a specifi c sign.
Pallor
May be racial or familial—or from anaemia, shock/faints, Stokes–Adams attack
(p460, pale fi rst, then fl ushing), hypothyroid ism, hypopituitarism, and albinism.
Anaemia is haemoglobin concentration <130g/L in men and <120g/L in non-pregnant
women (p324). It may be assessed from the conjunctivae and skin creases. Koilo-
nychia and stomatitis (p32) suggest iron defi ciency. Anaemia with jaundice suggests
haemolysis. If pallor just one limb or digit, think of emboli.
Skin discolouration
Generalized hyperpigmentation may be genetic (racial) or due to radiation; ACTH
(cross-reacts with melanin receptors, eg Addison’s disease (p226), Nelson’s syn-
drome (p76), ectopic ACTH in bronchial carcinoma); chronic kidney disease (urea,
p302); malabsorption; chloasma (seen in pregnancy or with the oral contraceptive
pill); biliary cirrhosis; haemochromatosis (‘bronzed diabetes’); carotenaemia; or
drugs (eg chlorpromazine, busulfan, amiodarone, gold).
Obesity
Defi ned by the World Health Organization as a BMI of over 30kg/m2. A higher waist
to hip ratio, indicating central fat distribution, is commoner in  and is associated
with greater health risks, which include type 2 diabetes mellitus, IHD, dyslipidaemia,
BP, osteoarthritis of weight-bearing joints, and cancer (breast and bowel); see p206.
The majority of cases are not due to specifi c metabolic disorders. Lifestyle change is
key to treatment, to increase energy expenditure and reduce intake (p244). Medica-
tion ± surgery may be considered if the patient fulfi ls strict criteria (BMI of 40 kg/m2
or more, or between 35 kg/m2 and 40 kg/m2 and other signifi cant disease that could
improve with weight loss, non-surgical measures have been tried and failed, patient
receives intensive management in a tier 3 service, and fi t for anaesthesia and sur-
gery). Conditions associated with obesity include: genetic (Prader–Willi syndrome,
Lawrence–Moon syndrome), hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, and hypothalamic
damage (eg tumour or trauma  damage to satiety regions).

Lymphadenopathy
Causes of lymphadenopathy are either reactive or infi ltrative:
Reactive:
Infective:
• Bacterial: eg pyogenic, TB, brucella, syphilis.
• Viral: EBV, HIV, CMV, infectious hepatitis.
• Others: toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis.
Non-infective: sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, berylliosis, connective tissue disease (eg
rheumatoid, SLE), dermatological (eczema, psoriasis), drugs (eg phenytoin).
Infi ltrative:
Benign histiocytosis—OHCS p644, lipoidoses.
Malignant:
• Haematological: lymphoma or leukaemia: ALL, CLL, AML (p356).
• Metastatic carcinoma: from breast, lung, bowel, prostate, kidney, or head and
neck cancers.
Oedema
(See p579.)
Pitting oedema: Fluid can either be squeezed out of the veins (increased hydrostatic
pressure, eg DVT, right heart failure) or diff use out because of reduced oncotic pres-
sure (low plasma proteins, eg cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enter-
opathy) leading to an osmotic gradient with the tissues (fi g 2.9, p39, p579). The cause
of oedema is still not completely understood.5
Periorbital oedema: Oedema around the face has a very diff erent diff erential; the
eyelid skin is very thin so periorbital oedema is usually the fi rst sign—think of al-
lergies (contact dermatitis, eg from eye make-up, stings), angioedema (can be
hereditary), infection (orbital cellulitis can be life-threatening, refer to hospital
immediately if concerned, other infections include EBV and sinusitis); if there is prop-
tosis (p219) think Graves’ disease, connective tissue diseases (eg dermatomyositis,
SLE, sarcoid, amyloid); and many others. Assess for systemic disease before putting
it down to allergies.
Non-pitting oedema: Ie non-indentable, is lymphoedema due to poor lymphatic
drainage. Can be due to radiotherapy, malignant infi ltration, infection, fi lariasis, or
rarely primary lymphoedema (Milroy’s syndrome p706).
Weight loss
Weight loss can be both a symptom (ie reported by the patient) and a sign (identifi ed
by physician). A feature of chronic disease, depression, malnutrition, malignancy,
chronic infections (eg TB, HIV/enteropathic AIDS), diabetes mellitus, and hyperthy-
roidism (typically in the presence of increased appetite). Severe generalized
muscle wasting is also seen as part of a number of degenerative neurological
diseases and in cardiac failure (cardiac cachexia), although in the latter, right
heart failure may not make weight loss a major complaint. Do not forget ano-
rexia nervosa (OHCS p382) as an underlying cause of weight loss.
Rule out treatable causes, eg diabetes is easy to diagnose—TB can be very hard. For
example, the CXR may look like cancer so don’t forget to send bronchoscopy samples
for ZN stain and TB culture. Unintentional weight loss should always ring alarm bells,
so assess patients carefully.
Cachexia
General muscle wasting from famine, or eating (dementia; stroke; MND, p506; ano-
rexia nervosa), malabsorption (enterop athic AIDS/slim disease/Cryptos por idium;
Whipple’s) or catabolism (neoplasia; CCF; TB; chronic kidney disease; leptin).6

The cardiovascular system: history
Table 2.3 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask
Presenting
Direct questions
symptoms
Chest pain Site? Central?
(see pp94–5 Onset? (Sudden? What was the patient doing?)
and p784)
Character? Ask patient to describe pain (Crushing? Heavy?).
Radiation? Ask specifi cally if moves to arm, neck, or jaw?
Associations? Ask specifi cally about shortness of breath, nausea, sweating.
Timing? Duration?
Exacerbating and alleviating factors? Worse with respiration or move-
ment (less likely to be angina)? Relieved by GTN? Worse on inspiration
and better when sitting forwards (pericarditis)?
Severity: out of 10?
Is patient known to have angina or chest pain; better/worse/same as
usual pain; is it more frequent? Decreasing exercise tolerance?
NB: ‘heartburn’ more likely if ‘burning’, onset after eating/drinking,
worse lying fl at, or associated with dysphagia.
Palpitations ‘Ever aware of your own heartbeat’? When and how did it start/stop?
Duration? Onset sudden/gradual? Associated with blackout (how
long)? Chest pain? Dyspnoea? Food related (eg caff eine)?
Regular fast palpitations may refl ect paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT).
Irregular fast palpitations are likely to be paroxysmal AF, or atrial fl ut-
ter with variable block.
Dropped or missed beats related to rest, recumbency, or eating are
likely to be atrial or ventricular ectopics.
Regular pounding may be due to anxiety.
Slow palpitations are likely to be due to drugs such as -blockers, or
bigeminus (fi g 3.34, p129).
Reassurance is vital and can be therapeutic. Check a TSH and consider a
24h ECG (Holter monitor, p125). An event recorder, if available, is better
than 24h ECGS.
Dyspnoea Duration? At rest? On exertion? Determine exercise tolerance (and any
(see p52, other reason for limitation, eg arthritis). NYHA classifi cation (p135)?
and p782) Worse when lying fl at, how many pillows does the patient sleep with
(orthopnoea)? Does the patient ever wake up in the night gasping for
breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea), and how often? Any ankle
swelling?
Dizziness/ Dizziness is a loose term, so try to clarify if your patient means: did
blackouts patient lose consciousness, and for how long (short duration suggests
(see pp460–3) cardiac while longer duration suggests a neurological cause)? Any
warning (pre-syncope)? What was patient doing at the time? Sudden/
gradual? Associated symptoms? Any residual symptoms, eg confusion?
How long did it take for patient to return to ‘normal’? Tongue biting
(pp460–1), seizure, incontinence? Witnessed? Memory loss pre/post
event?
Vertigo (p462), the illusion of rotation of either the patient or their sur-
roundings ± diffi culty walking/standing, patients may fall over.
Imbalance, a diffi culty in walking straight but without vertigo, from
peripheral nerve, posterior column, cerebellar, or other central pathway
failure.
Faintness ie ‘light-headedness’, seen in anaemia, BP, postural hypoten-
sion, hypoglycaemia, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and epilepsy.
Claudication SOCRATES? Foot/calf/thigh/buttock? ‘Claudication distance’, ie how
long can patient walk before onset of pain? Rest pain?

The cardiovascular system: examination 2
General inspection Ill or well? In pain? Dyspnoeic? Are they pale, cold, and clammy?
Can you hear the click of a prosthetic valve? Inspect for scars: median sternotomy
(CABG; valve replacement; congenital heart disease). Inspect for any pacemakers/
internal cardiac defi brillators (ICDS). Look around the bed for oxygen and GTN spray.
Hands Finger clubbing occurs in congenital cyanotic heart disease and endocardi-
tis. Splinter haemorrhages, Osler’s nodes (tender nodules, eg in fi nger pulps) and
Janeway lesions (red macules on palms, fi g 3.38, p151) are signs of infective endocar-
ditis. If found, examine the fundi for Roth’s spots (retinal infarcts, p560). Are there
nail fold infarcts (vasculitis, p556) or nailbed capillary pulsation (Quincke’s sign in
aortic regurgitation)? Is there arachnodactyly (Marfan’s) or polydactyly (ASD)? Are
there tendon xanthomata (see BOX ‘Hyperlipidaemia’)?
Pulse See p42. Feel for radio-femoral delay (coarctation of the aorta) and radio-
radial delay (eg from aortic arch aneurysm).
Blood pressure (see BOX ‘An unusual BP measurement’) Systolic BP is the pressure at
which the pulse is fi rst heard as on cuff defl ation (Korotkoff sounds); the diastolic is when
the heart sounds disappear or become muffl ed (eg in the young). The pulse pressure is
the diff erence between systolic and diastolic pressures. It is narrow in aortic stenosis and
hypovolaemia, and wide in aortic regurgitation, arteriosclerosis, and septic shock. Defi n-
ing hypertension: see p138. Examine the fundi for hypertensive changes (p138). Shock may
occur if systolic <90mmHg (p790). Postural hypotension is defi ned as a drop in systolic
>20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg on standing for 3–5 min (see BOX ‘Postural hypotension’).
Carotid pulse (See p42.)
Jugular venous pressure (See p43.)
Face Is there corneal arcus (fi g 2.7, p39) or xanthelasma (fi g 2.29, p60, signifying
dyslipidaemia, p690)? Is there a malar fl ush (mitral stenosis, low cardiac output)?
Are there signs of Graves’ disease, eg bulging eyes (exophthalmos) or goitre—p218)?
Is the face dysmorphic, eg Down’s syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome (p706)—or Turner’s,
Noonan’s, or Williams syndromes (p149)?
Praecordium Palpate the apex beat. Normal position: 5th intercostal space in
the mid-clavicular line. Is it displaced laterally? Is it abnormal in nature: heaving
(caused by outfl ow obstruction, eg aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension), thrust-
ing (caused by volume overload, eg mitral or aortic incompetence), tapping (mitral
stenosis, essentially a palpable 1st heart sound), diffuse (LV failure, dilated cardio-
myopathy) or double impulse (H(O)CM, p152)? Is there dextrocardia? Feel for left
parasternal heave (RV enlargement, eg in pulmonary stenosis, cor pulmonale, ASD)
or thrills (transmitted murmurs).
Auscultating the heart Also auscultate for bruits over the carotids and elsewhere,
particularly if there is inequality between pulses or absence of a pulse. Causes: ath-
erosclerosis (elderly), vasculitis (young, p556).
Lungs Examine the bases for creps & pleural eff usions, indicative of cardiac failure.
Oedema Examine the ankles, legs, sacrum, and torso for pitting oedema. (You may
prefer to examine ankles while standing at the foot of the bed as it is a good early
clue that there may be further pathology to be found.)
Abdomen Hepatomegaly and ascites in right-sided heart failure; pulsatile hepato-
megaly with tricuspid regurgitation; splenomegaly with infective endocarditis.
Fundoscopy Roth spots (infective endocarditis).
Urine dipstick Haematuria.

An unusual BP measurement
Don’t interpret a BP value in isolation (p138). We cannot diagnose hypertension
(or hypotension) on one BP reading. Take into account pain, the ‘white coat’ eff ect
(BP higher in a medical setting), and equipment. Getting cuff size right is vital.
Optimal cuff width is 40% of the arm circumference. If you suspect a BP read-
ing to be anomalous, check the equipment and review the observation chart for
previous readings and other vital signs. Consider taking a manual reading with a
diff erent set yourself.
Often a quiet chat will bring the BP down (yours and your patient’s: keep your
ears open, and the patient may reveal some new tangential but vital fact that the
offi cial history glossed over). Many things aff ect BP readings from background
noise to how much you touch the patient. If BP, eg 150/90, check both arms. If
the systolic diff erence is >20mmHg, consider peripheral vascular disease, and if
the patient could have a thoracic aortic aneurysm or co arctation (rare). NB: right
arm diastolic is normally 2.4–5mmHg higher than left.
Postural hypotension
This is an important cause of falls and faints in the elderly. It is defi ned as a drop
in systolic BP >20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg after standing for 3min vs lying.
Causes: Hypo volaemia (early sign); drugs, eg nitrates, diuretics, antihyperten-
sives, antipsychotics; Addison’s (p226); hypopituitarism (ACTH); autonomic neu-
ropathy (p505, DM, multisystem atrophy, p494); after a marathon run (peripheral
resistance is low for some hours); idiopathic.
Treatment:
• Lie down if feeling faint.
• Stand slowly (with escape route: don’t move away from the chair too soon!).
• Consider referral to a ‘falls clinic’, where special equipment is available for moni-
toring patient under various tilts.
• Manage autonomic neuropathy, p505.
• Water and salt ingestion can help (eg 150mmol Na+/d), but Na+ has its problems.
• Physical measures: leg crossing, squatting, elast ic compression stockings (check
dorsalis pedis pulse is present), and careful exercise may help.
• If post-prandial dizziness, eat little and often; carbohydrate and alcohol intake.
• Head-up tilt of the bed at night renin release, so fl uid loss and standing BP.
• 1st-line drugs: fl udrocortisone (retains fl uid) 50mcg/d; go up to 300mcg/24h PO
only if tolerated. Monitor weight; beware if CCF, renal impairment, or albumin as
fl udrocortisone worsens oedema.
• 2nd-line drugs: sympathomimetics, eg midodrine (not always available) or ephed-
rine; pyridostigmine (eg if detrusor under-activity too).
• If these fail, turn things on their head and ask: is this really supine hypertension?
Hyperlipidaemia
Xanthomata are localized deposits of fat under the skin, occurring over joints,
tendons, hands, and feet. Xanthel asma refers to xanthoma on the eyelid (p691,
fi g 14.13). Corneal arcus (fi g 2.7, p39) is a crescentic-shaped opacity at the periph-
ery of the cornea. Common in those over 60yrs, can be normal, but may represent
hyperlipidaemia, especially in those under this age.
Top tips
The hand can be used as a manometer to estimate JVP/CVP if you cannot see the neck
properly (eg central line in situ). Hold the hand palm down below the level of the
heart until the veins dilate (patient must be warm!), then lift slowly, keeping the arm
horizontal. The veins should empty as the hand is raised. Empty veins below the level
of the heart suggests a low CVP, if they remain full it suggests a normal/high CVP.

Pulses
Assess the radial pulse to determine rate and rhythm. Character and volume are
best assessed at the brachial or carotid arteries. A collapsing pulse may also be felt
at the radial artery when the patient’s arm is elevated above their head. See fi g 2.10.
Rate Is the pulse fast (100bpm, p126) or slow (60bpm, p124)?
Rhythm An irregularly irregular pulse occurs in AF or multiple ectopics. A regularly
irregular pulse occurs in 2° heart block and ventricular bigeminus.
Character and volume
• Bounding pulses are caused by CO2 retention, liver failure, and sepsis.
• Small volume pulses occur in aortic stenosis, shock, and pericardial eff usion.
• Collapsing (‘waterhammer’) pulses are caused by aortic incompetence, AV mal-
formations, and a patent ductus arteriosus.
• Anacrotic (slow-rising) pulses occur in aortic stenosis.
• Bisferiens pulses occur in combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation.
• Pulsus alternans (alternating strong and weak beats) suggests LVF, cardio-
myopathy, or aortic stenosis.
• Jerky pulses occur in H(O)CM.
• Pulsus paradoxus (systolic pressure weakens in inspiration by >10mmHg) occurs
in severe asthma, pericardial constriction, or cardiac tamponade.
Peripheral pulses (See p36.) See p771 for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling.
Waterhammer pulse
The waterhammer was a popular toy that consisted of a vacuum tube half-fi lled
with water. On inversion, the whoosh of water produced an intriguing hammer-
blow as it rushed from end to end. This is the alternative name for Corrigan’s
collapsing pulse—ie one in which the upstroke is abrupt and steep, whose peak
is reached early and with abnormal force—before a rapid downstroke (as blood
whooshes back into the left ventricle through an incompetent aortic valve).

jugular vein as it passes just medial to the clavicular head of the sterno cleidomastoid
up behind the angle of the jaw to the earlobes. The JVP is assessed by measuring the
vertical height from the manubriosternal angle (not the sternal notch) to the top of
the pulse. Pressure at zero (at the sternal angle) is 5cm, so add the height of the JVP
with 5cm to obtain the right heart fi lling pressure in cm of water. A pressure above
9cm (4cm above the sternal angle at 45°) is elevated.
Is the pulse venous (and not arterial)?
• Usually impalpable, and obliterated by fi nger pressure on the vessel.
• Rises transiently with pressure on abdomen (abdominojugular refl ux)2 or on liver
(hepatojug ular refl ux), and alters with posture and respiration (disappears when
patient sits from lying fl at).
• Usually has a double pulse for every arterial pulse. See fi g 2.12.
Abnormalities of the JVP
• Raised JVP with normal waveform: Fluid overload, right heart failure.
• Fixed raised JVP with absent pulsation: SVC obstruction (p528).
• Large a wave: Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis.
• Cannon a wave: When the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve,
large ‘cannon’ a waves result. Causes—complete heart block, single chamber ven-
tricular pacing, ventricular arrhythmias/ectopics.
• Absent a wave: Atrial fi brillation.
• Large v waves: Tricuspid regurgitation—look for earlobe movement.
• Constrictive pericarditis: High plateau of JVP (which rises on inspiration—Kuss-
maul’s sign) with deep x and y descents.
• Absent JVP: When lying fl at, the jugular vein should be fi lled. If there is reduced
circulatory volume (eg dehydration, haemorrhage) the JVP may be absent.
Fig 2.12 The jugular venous pressure wave. The JVP drops as the X descent during
ventricular systole because the right atrium is no longer contracting. This means
that the pressure in the right atrium is dropping and this is refl ected by the JVP.

The heart sounds
Listen systematically: sounds then murmurs. While listening, palpate the carotid
artery: S1 is synchronous with the upstroke.
Heart sounds See fi g 2.13. The 1st and 2nd sounds are usually clear. Confi dent pro-
nouncements about other sounds and soft murmurs may be diffi cult. Even senior
colleagues disagree with one another about the more diffi cult sounds and murmurs.
The 1st heart sound (S1) Represents closure of mitral (M1) and tricuspid (T1) valves.
Splitting in inspiration may be heard and is normal.
• Loud SIn mitral stenosis, because the narrowed valve orifi ce limits ventricular
1
fi lling, there is no gradual decrease in fl ow towards the end of diastole. The valves
are, therefore, at their maximum excursion at the end of diastole, and so shut rap-
idly leading to a loud S1 (the ‘tapping’ apex). S1 is also loud if diastolic fi lling time is
shortened, eg if the PR interval is short, and in tachycardia.
• Soft S 1 occurs if the diastolic fi lling time is prolonged, eg prolonged PR interval, or if
the mitral valve leafl ets fail to close properly (ie mitral incompetence).
The intensity of S1 is variable in AV block, AF, and nodal or ventricular tachycardia.
The 2nd heart sound (S2) Represents aortic (A2) and pulmonary valve (P2) closure.
The most important abnormality of A2 is softening in aortic stenosis.
• A is said to be loud in tachycardia, hypertension, and transposition, but this is
2
probably not a useful clinical entity.
• P is loud in pulmonary hypertension and soft in pulmonary stenosis.
2
• Splitting of S in inspiration is normal and is mainly due to the variation of right
2
heart venous return with respiration, delaying the pulmonary component.
• Wide splitting occurs in right bundle branch block (BBB), pulmonary stenosis,
deep inspiration, mitral regurgitation, and VSD.
• Wide fi xed splitting occurs in atrial septal defect (ASD).
• Reversed splitting (ie A2 following P2, with splitting increasing on expiration)
occurs in left bundle branch block, aortic stenosis, PDA (patent ductus arterio-
sus), and right ventricular pacing.
• A single S2 occurs in Fallot’s tetralogy, severe aortic or pulmonary stenosis,
pulmonary atresia, Eisenmenger’s syndrome (p156), large VSD, or hypertension.
NB: splitting and P2 are heard best in the pulmonary area.
Additional sounds
3rd heart sound (S3) may occur just after S2. It is low pitched and best heard with the
bell of the stethoscope. S3 is pathological over the age of 30yrs. A loud S3 occurs in a
dilated left ventricle with rapid ventricular fi lling (mitral regurgitation, VSD) or poor LV
function (post MI, dilated cardiomyopathy). In constrictive pericarditis or restrictive
cardiomyopathy it occurs early and is more high pitched (‘pericardial knock’).
4th heart sound (S4) occurs just before S1. Always abnormal, it represents atrial
contraction against a ventricle made stiff by any cause, eg aortic stenosis or hyper-
tensive heart disease.
Triple and gallop rhythms A 3rd or 4th heart sound occurring with a sinus tachycar-
dia may give the impression of galloping hooves. An S3 gallop has the same rhythm
as ‘Ken-tucky’, whereas an S4 gallop has the same rhythm as ‘Tenne-ssee’. When S3
and S4 occur in a tachycardia, eg with pulmonary embolism, they may summate and
appear as a single sound, a summation gallop.
An ejection systolic click is heard early in systole with bicuspid aortic valves, and if
BP. The right heart equivalent lesions may also cause clicks.
Mid-systolic clicks occur in mitral valve prolapse (p144).
An opening snap precedes the mid-diastolic murmur of mitral (and tricuspid) steno-
sis. It indicates a pliable (non-calcifi ed) valve.
Prosthetic sounds are caused by non-biological valves, on opening and closing: rum-
bling sounds ≈ ball and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards); single clicks ≈ tilting disc
valve (eg single disc: Bjork Shiley; bileafl et: St Jude—often quieter). Prosthetic mitral
valve clicks occur in time with S1, aortic valve clicks in time with S2.

Cardiac murmurs
Always consider other symptoms and signs before auscultation and think: ‘What
do I expect to hear?’ But don’t let your expectations determine what you hear.
Use the stethoscope correctly: remember that the bell is good for low-pitched
sounds (eg mitral stenosis) and should be applied gently. The diaphragm fi lters out
low pitches, making higher-pitched murmurs easier to detect (eg aortic regurgita-
tion). NB: a bell applied tightly to the skin becomes a diaphragm.
Consider any murmur in terms of character, timing, loudness, area where loudest,
radiation, and accentuating manoeuvres.
When in doubt, rely on echocardiography rather than disputed sounds. (But still
enjoy trying to fi gure out the clinical conundrum!)
Character and timing (See fi g 2.14.)
• An ejection-systolic murmur (ESM, crescendo–decrescendo) usually originates
from the outfl ow tract and waxes and wanes with the intraventricular pressures.
ESMS may be innocent and are common in children and high-output states (eg
tachycardia, pregnancy). Organic causes include aortic stenosis and sclerosis, pul-
monary stenosis, and H(O)CM.
• A pansystolic murmur (PSM) is of uniform intensity and merges with S2. It is usu-
ally organic and occurs in mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (S1 may also be soft in
these), or a ventricular septal defect (p156). Mitral valve prolapse may produce a
late systolic murmur ± midsystolic click.
• Early diastolic murmurs (EDMs) are high pitched and easily missed: listen for the
‘absence of silence’ in early diastole. An EDM occurs in aortic and, though rare, pul-
monary regurgitation. If the pulmonary regurgitation is secondary to pulmonary
hypertension resulting from mitral stenosis, then the EDM is called a Graham Steell
murmur.
• Mid-diastolic murmurs (MDMs) are low pitched and rumbling. They occur in mitral
stenosis (accentuated presystolically if heart still in sinus rhythm), rheumatic fever
(Carey Coombs’ murmur: due to thickening of the mitral valve leafl ets), and aortic
regurgitation (Austin Flint murmur: due to the fl uttering of the anterior mitral
valve cusp caused by the regurgitant stream).
Intensity All murmurs are graded on a scale of 1–6 (see table 2.4), though in practice
diastolic murmurs, being less loud, are only graded 1–4. Intensity is a poor guide to
the severity of a lesion—an ESM may be inaudible in severe aortic stenosis.
Area where loudest Though an unreliable sign, mitral murmurs tend to be loudest
over the apex, in contrast to the area of greatest intensity from lesions of the aortic
(right 2nd intercostal space), pulmonary (left 2nd intercostal space), and tricuspid
(lower left sternal edge) valves.
Radiation The ESM of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotids, in contrast
to the PSM of mitral regurgitation, which radiates to the axilla.
Accentuating manoeuvres
• Movements that bring the relevant part of the heart closer to the stethoscope ac-
centuate murmurs (eg leaning forward for aortic regurgitation, left lateral position
for mitral stenosis).
• Expiration increases blood fl ow to the left side of the heart and therefore accentu-
ates left-sided murmurs. Inspiration has the opposite eff ect.
• Valsalva manoeuvre (forced expiration against a closed glottis) decreases sys-
temic venous return, accentuating mitral valve prolapse and H(O)CM, but softening
mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Squatting has exactly the opposite eff ect.
Exercise accentuates the murmur of mitral stenosis.
Non-valvular murmurs A pericardial friction rub may be heard in pericarditis.
It is a superfi cial scratching sound, not confi ned to systole or diastole. Continuous
murmurs are present throughout the cardiac cycle and may occur with a patent
ductus arteriosus, arteriovenous fi stula, or ruptured sinus of Valsalva.

Fig 2.14 Typical waveforms of common heart murmurs.
Grading intensity of heart murmurs
The following grading is commonly used for murmurs—systolic murmurs from 1
to 6 and diastolic murmurs from 1 to 4, never being clinically >4/6.
Table 2.4 Grading of heart murmurs.
Grade Description
1/6 Very soft, only heard after listening for a while
2/6 Soft, but detectable immediately
3/6 Clearly audible, but no thrill palpable
4/6 Clearly audible, palpable thrill
5/6 Audible with stethoscope only partially touching chest
6/6 Can be heard without placing stethoscope on chest
Prosthetic valve murmurs
Prosthetic valves: Created either from synthetic material (mechanical prosthesis)
or from biological tissue (bioprosthesis). The choice of prosthesis is determined by
the anticipated longevity of the patient and the patient’s ability to tolerate antico-
agulation. Three mechanical valve designs exist: the caged ball valve, the tilting disc
(single leafl et) valve, and the bileafl et valve. Tissue valves are made from porcine
valves or bovine pericardium.
Prosthetic aortic valves: All types produce a degree of outfl ow obstruction and
thus have an ESM. The intensity of this murmur increases as the valve fails. Ball and
cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards) and tissue valves do close completely in diastole
and so any diastolic murmur implies valve failure.
Prosthetic mitral valves: Ball and cage valves project into the left ventricle and
can cause a low-intensity ESM as they interfere with the ejected stream. Tissue
valves and bileafl et valves can have a low-intensity diastolic murmur. Consider
any systolic murmur of loud intensity to be a sign of regurgitation and  failure.
Eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation
• de Musset’s sign—head nodding in time with the pulse.
• Müller’s sign—systolic pulsations of the uvula.
• Corrigan’s sign—visible carotid pulsations.
• Quincke’s sign—capillary nailbed pulsation in the fi ngers.
• Traube’s sign—‘pistol shot’ femorals, a booming sound heard over the femorals.
• Duroziez’s sign—to and fro diastolic murmur heard when compressing the femo-
rals proximally with the stethoscope.

The respiratory system: history
Table 2.5 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask
Presenting
Direct questions
symptoms
Cough Duration? Character (eg barking/hollow/dry)? Nocturnal (≈asthma,
(see BOX ‘Charac- ask about other atopic symptoms, ie eczema, hay fever)? Exacerbat-
teristic coughs’) ing factors? Sputum (colour? How much?). Any blood/haemoptysis?
Haemoptysis Always think about TB (recent foreign travel?) and mal ignancy
(see table 2.6 and (weight loss?). Mixed with sputum? (Blood not mixed with sputum
BOX ‘Haemop- suggests pulmonary embolism, trauma, or bleeding into a lung cav-
tysis’) ity. ) Melaena? (Occurs if enough coughed-up blood is swallowed.)
Dyspnoea Duration? Steps climbed/distance walked before onset? NYHA clas-
(see table 2.7 and sifi cation (p135)? Diurnal variation (≈asthma)?
BOX ‘Dyspnoea’ Ask specifi cally about circumstances in which dyspnoea occurs (eg
and p782) occupational allergen exposure).
Hoarseness Eg due to laryngitis, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, Singer’s
(OHCS p568) nodules, or laryngeal tumour.
Wheeze (p52)
Fever/night
sweats (p29)
Chest pain SOCRATES (see p36), usually ‘pleuritic’ if respiratory (ie worse on
(p94 & p784) inspiration?).
Stridor (see BOX
‘Stridor’)
History Ask about current symptoms (table 2.5) and past history: pneumonia/bron-
chitis; TB; atopy3 (asthma/eczema/hay fever); previous CXR abnormalities; lung surgery;
myopathy; neurological disorders. Connective tissue disorders, eg rheumatoid, SLE.
Drug history Respiratory drugs (eg steroids, bronchodilators)? Any other drugs, esp-
ecially with respiratory SE (eg ACE inhibitors, cytotoxics, -blockers, amiodarone)?
Family history Atopy?3 Emphysema? TB?
Social history Quantify smoking in ‘pack-years’ (20 cigarettes/day for 1 year = 1
pack-year). Occupational exposure (farming, mining, asbestos) has possible compen-
satory implications. Pets at home (eg birds)? Recent travel/TB contacts?
Stridor
Inspiratory sound due to partial obstruction of upper airways. Obstruction may
be due to something within the lumen (eg foreign body, tumour, bilateral vocal
cord palsy), within the wall (eg oedema from anaphylaxis, laryngospasm, tumour,
croup, acute epiglottitis, amyloidosis), or extrinsic (eg goitre, oesophagus, lymph-
adenopathy, post-op stridor, after neck surgery). It’s an emerge ncy (p772) if gas
exchange is compromised. NB: wheeze is an expiratory sound.
Characteristic coughs
Coughing is relatively non-specifi c, resulting from irritation anywhere from the
pharynx to the lungs. The character of a cough may, however, give clues as to the
underlying cause:
• Loud, brassy coughing suggests pressure on the trachea, eg by a tumour.
• Hollow, ‘bovine’ coughing is associated with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.
• Barking coughs occur in croup.
• Chronic cough Think of pertussis, TB, foreign body, asthma (eg nocturnal).
• Dry, chronic coughing may occur following acid irritation of the lungs in oe-
sophageal refl ux, and as a side-eff ect of ACE inhibitors.
Do not ignore a change in character of a chronic cough; it may signify a new
problem, eg infection, malignancy.
3 Atopy implies predisposition to, or concurrence of, asthma, hay fever and eczema with production of
specifi c IgE on exposure to common allergens (eg house dust mite, grass, cats).

Haemoptysis
Blood is coughed up, eg frothy, alkaline, and bright red, often in a context of
known chest disease (vomited blood is acidic and dark).
Table 2.6 Respiratory causes of haemoptysis.
1 Infective TB; bronchiectasis; bronchitis; pneumonia; lung abscess;
COPD; fungi (eg aspergillosis); viruses (from pneumonitis,
cryo globulinaemia, eg with hepatitis viruses, HIV-associ-
ated pneumocystosis, or MAI, p400). Helminths: paragon-
imiasis; hydatid (p435); schistosomiasis.
2 Neoplastic Primary or secondary.
3 Vascular Lung infarction (PE); vasculitis (ANCA-associated; RA; SLE);
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; AV malforma-
tion; capillaritis.
4 Parenchymal Diff use interstitial fi brosis; sarcoidosis; haemoside rosis;
Goodpasture’s syndrome; cystic fi brosis.
5 Pulmonary Idiopathic, thromboembolic, congenital cyanotic heart
hypertension disease (p156), pulmonary fi brosis, bronchiectasis.
6 Coagulopathies Any—eg thrombocytopenia, p344; DIC; warfarin excess.
7 Trauma/foreign body Eg post-intubation, or an eroding implanted defi brillator.
8 Pseudo-haemoptysis Munchausen’s (p706); aspirated haematemesis; red pig ment
(prodigiosin) from Serratia marcescens (Gram-negative
bacteria) in sputum.7
Rare causes refuse to be classifi ed neatly: vascular causes may have infective origins,
eg hydatid cyst may count as a foreign body, and infection, and vascular if it fi stulates
with the aorta; ditto for infected (mycotic) aneurysm rupture, or TB aortitis. Infective
causes entailing coagu lopathy: dengue; leptospirosis. In monthly haemoptysis, think
of lung endometriosis.
: Haemoptysis may need treating in its own right, if massi ve (eg trauma, TB,
hydatid cyst, cancer, AV malformation): call chest team, consider interventional
radiology input (danger is drowning: lobe resection, endobronchial tamponade, or
arterial embolization may be needed). Set up IVI, do CXR, blood gases, FBC, INR/APTT,
crossmatch. If distressing, give prompt IV morphine, eg if inoperable malignancy.
Dyspnoea
Subjective sensation of shortness of breath, often exacerbated by exertion.
• Lung—airway and interstitial disease. May be hard to separate from cardiac
causes; asthma may wake patient, and cause early morning dyspnoea & wheeze.
• Cardiac—eg ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular failure (LVF), mitral ste-
nosis, of any cause. LVF is associated with orthopnoea (dyspnoea worse on lying;
‘How many pillows?’) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND; dyspnoea waking
one up). Other features include ankle oedema, lung crepitations, and JVP.
• Anatomical—eg diseases of the chest wall, muscles, pleura. Ascites can cause
breathlessness by splinting the diaphragm, restricting its movement.
• Others Any shocked patient may also be dyspnoeic (p790 & p607)—dyspnoea
may be shock’s presenting feature. Also anaemia or metabolic acidosis caus-
ing respiratory compensation, eg ketoacidosis, aspirin poisoning. Look for other
clues—dyspnoea at rest unassociated with exertion, may be psychogenic: pro-
longed hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis. This causes a fall in ion ized
calcium leading to apparent hypocalcaemia. Features include peripheral and
perioral paraesthesiae ± carpopedal spasm. Speed of onset helps diagnosis:

The respiratory system: examination 2
General inspection ‘Comfortable at rest’ or unwell? Cachectic? Respiratory dis-
tress? (if high negative intrathoracic pressures are needed to generate air entry).
Stridor? Respiratory rate, breathing pattern (see BOX ‘Breathing patterns’). Look for
chest wall and spine deformities (see p55). Inspect for scars of past surgery, chest
drains, or radiotherapy (skin thickening, tattoos for radiotherapy). Chest wall move-
ment: symmetrical? (if not, pathology on restricted side). Paradoxical respiration?
(abdomen sucked in with inspiration; seen in diaphragmatic paralysis, see p502).
Hands Clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tar stains, fi ne tremor (-agonist use), wast-
ing of in trinsic muscles (T1 lesions, eg Pancoast’s tumour, p708). Tender wrists (hy-
pertrophic pulmonary osteo arthropathy—cancer). Aster ixis (CO2 retention). Pulse:
paradoxical (respiratory distress), bounding (CO2 retention).
Face Ptosis and constricted pupil (Horner’s syndrome, eg Pancoast’s tumour, p708)?
Bluish tongue and lips (central cyanosis, p34)? Conjunctival pallor (anaemia)?
Neck Trachea: Central or displaced? (towards collapse or away from large pleural
eff usion/tension pneumothorax; slight deviation to right is normal). Cricosternal dis-
tance <3cm is hyperexpansion. Tracheal tug: descent of trachea with inspiration (se-
vere airfl ow limitation). Lymphadenopathy: TB/Ca? JVP:  in cor pulmonale.
Palpation Apex beat: Impalpable? (COPD/pleural eff usion/dextrocardia?) Ex-
pansion: <5cm on deep inspiration is abnormal. Symmetry? Tactile vocal
fremitus:  implies consolidation.
Percussion Dull percussion note: Collapse, consolidation, fi brosis, pleural thicken-
ing, or pleural eff usion (‘stony dull’). Cardiac dullness usually detectable over the left
side. Liver dullness usually extends up to 5th rib, right mid-clavicular line; below this,
resonant chest is a sign of lung hyperexpansion (eg asthma, COPD). Hyper-resonant
percussion note: Pneumothorax or hyperinfl ation (COPD).

 Signs of respiratory distress
• Tachypnoea.
• Nasal fl aring.
• Tracheal tug (pulling of thyroid cartilage towards sternal notch in inspiration).
• Use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, platysma, infrahyoid).
• Intercostal, subcostal, and sternal recession.
• Pulsus paradoxus (p42).
Breathing patterns
Hyperventilation: Tachypnoea (ie >20 breaths/min) or deep (hyperp noea, ie tidal
volume). Hyperpnoea is not unpleasant, unlike dyspnoea. It may cause respiratory
alkalosis, hence paraesthesiae ± muscle spasm (Ca2+). The main cause is anxiety:
associated dizziness, chest tightness/pain, palpita tions, and panic. Rare causes:
response to metabolic acidosis; brainstem lesions.
• Kussmaul respiration is deep, sighing breaths in severe metabolic acidosis
(blowing off CO2), eg diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal impairment.
• Neurogenic hyperventilation is produced by pontine lesions.
• The hyperventilation syndrome involves panic attacks associated with hyper-
ventilation, palpitations, dizziness, faintness, tinnitus, alarming chest pain/
tightness, perioral and peripheral tingling (plasma Ca2+). Treatment: relaxation
techniques and breathing into a paper bag (inspired CO2 corrects the alkalosis).
NB: the anxious patient in A&E with hyperventilation and a respiratory alkalosis
may actually be presenting with an aspirin overdose (p844).
Cheyne–Stokes breathing: Breaths get deeper and deeper, then shallower (±epi-
sodic apnoea) in cycles. Causes—brainstem lesions or compression (stroke, ICP).
If the cycle is long (eg 3min), the cause may be a long lung-to-brain circulation time
(eg in chronic pulmonary oedema or cardiac output). It is enhanced by opioids.
Sputum examination
Further examination—sputum, temperature charts, O
2
sats, PEFR: Inspect spu-
tum and send suspicious sputum for microscopy (Gram stain and auramine/ZN
stain, if indicated), culture, and cytology.
• Black carbon specks suggests smoking: commonest cause of increased sputum.
• Yellow/green sputum suggests infection, eg bronchiectasis, pneumonia.
• Pink frothy sputum suggests pulmonary oedema.
• Bloody sputum (haemoptysis) may be due to malignancy, TB, infection, or trau-
ma, and requires investigation for these causes. See p49.
• Clear sputum is probably saliva.

Herr Minty and his pigeon chest
Chest wall deformities such as pectus excavatum are quite common, often
appearing during adolescent growth spurts. Exercise intolerance is the main
symptom (from heart compr ession—consider CXR/CT). Indications for surgical
correction (rarely needed): ≥2: a severe, symptomatic deformity; progression
of deformity; paradoxical respiratory chest wall motion; pectus index >3.25 on
CT; cardiac or lung compression; restrictive spirometry; cardiac pathology that
might be from compression of the heart.
Psychological eff ects are interesting and not to be dismissed as their eff ects
may be greater than any physical eff ects.8 Because these people hate exposing
their chests they may become introverted, and never learn to swim, so don’t let
them sink without trace. Be sympathetic, and remember Herr Minty, who inau-

Abdominal pain
Character depends on underlying cause. Examples: irritation of the mucosa (acute
gastritis), smooth muscle spasm (acute enterocolitis), capsular stretching (liver con-
gestion in CCF), peritoneal infl ammation (acute appendicitis), and direct splanchnic
nerve stimulation (retrop eritoneal extension of tumour). The character (constant
or colicky, sharp or dull), duration, and frequency depend on the mechanism of
production. The location and distribution of referred pain depend on the anatomi-
cal site. Time of occurrence and aggravating or relieving factors such as meals,
defecation, and sleep also have special signifi cance related to the underlying disease
process. The site of the pain may provide a clue:
• Epigastric: Pancreatitis, gastritis/duodenitis, peptic ulcer, gallbladder disease,
aortic aneurysm.
• Left upper quadrant: Peptic ulcer, gastric or colonic (splenic fl exure) cancer,
splenic rupture, subphrenic or perinephric abscess, renal (colic, pyelonephritis).
• Right upper quadrant: Cholecystitis, biliary colic, hepatitis, peptic ulcer, colonic
cancer (hepatic fl exure), renal (colic, pyelonephritis), subphrenic/perinephric ab-
scess.
• Loin: (lateral ⅓ of back between thorax and pelvis—merges with the fl ank, p565)
Renal colic, pyelonephritis, renal tumour, perinephric abscess, pain referred from
vertebral column. Causes of fl ank pain are similar (see index for fuller list).
• Left iliac fossa: Diverticulitis, volvulus, colon cancer, pelvic abscess, infl am m atory
bowel disease, hip pathology, renal colic, urinary tract infection (UTI), cancer in
undescended testis; zoster—wait for the rash! (p454). Gynae: torsion of ovarian
cyst, salpingitis, ectopic pregnancy.
• Right iliac fossa pain: All causes of left iliac fossa pain plus appendicitis and
Crohn’s ileitis, but usually excluding diverticulitis.
• Pelvic: Urological: UTI, retention, stones. Gynae: menstruation, pregnancy, endome-
triosis (OHCS p288), salpingitis, endometritis (OHCS p274), ovarian cyst torsion.
• Generalized: Gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, peritonitis, constipation.
• Central: Mesenteric ischaemia, abdominal aneurysm, pancreatitis.
Remember referred pain: Myocardial infarct  epigastrium; pleural pathology.
Abdominal distension (masses and the ‘famous fi ve’ Fs)
Enid Blyton’s Famous Five characters can generally solve any crime or diag nos tic
problem using 1950s methodologies steeped in endless school holid ays, copious
confection-laden mid night feasts, and lashings of homemade ginger beer.
Let’s give them the problem of abdominal distension. The sweets and drinks used
by the Famous Five actually contribute to the distension itself: fat, fluid, faeces,
flatus, and fetus. If you think it far-fetched to implicate ginger beer in the genesis
of fetuses, note that because it was homemade, like the fun, there was no limit to
its intoxicating powers in those long-gone vintage summers. The point is to think to
ask ‘When was your last period?’ whenever confronted by a distended abdomen.
Flatus will be resonant on percussion. Fluid will be dull, and can be from ascites (eg
from malignancy or cirrhosis: look for shifting dullness), distended bladder (cannot
get below it) or an aortic aneurysm (expansile). Masses can be pelvic (think of uter-
ine fi broids or ovarian pathology) or tumours from colon, stomach, pancreas, liver, or
kidney. Also see causes of ascites with portal hypertension (p604), hepatomegaly
(p61), splenomegaly, and other abdominal masses (p604).
SSRIS and upper GI bleeding risk
SSRIs have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding.9 SSRIs are thought
to increase gastric acidity and serotonin is thought to play a role in platelet ag-
gregation. This may lead to an increased risk of ulcers and bleeding, particularly
when co-prescribed with anticoagulants and drugs aff ecting intestinal lining (eg
NSAIDS). NICE10 recommends cautious concomitant use of SSRIs with anticoagu-
lants or NSAIDS and recommends gastroprotection (eg PPI) for older patients tak-
ing NSAIDs or aspirin.

Gastrointestinal symptoms
Faecal incontinence
This is common in the elderly. Do your best to help, and get social services involved
if concerned. Continence depends on many factors—mental function, stool (volume
and consistency), anatomy (sphincter function, rectal distensibility, anorectal sensa-
tion and refl exes). Defects in any area can cause loss of faecal continence.
Causes: Often multifactorial. Is it passive faecal soiling or urgency-related stool
loss? Consider the following:
• Sphincter dysfunction:
• Vaginal delivery is the commonest cause due to sphincter tears or pudendal
nerve damage.
• Surgical trauma, eg following procedures for fi stulas, haemorrhoids, fi ssures.
• Impaired sensation—diabetes, MS, dementia, any spinal cord lesions (consider
cord compression if acute faecal incontinence).
• Faecal impaction—overfl ow diarrhoea, extremely common, especially in the el-
derly, and very easily treated.
• Idiopathic—although there is often no clear cause found, especially in elderly
women, this is usually multifactorial, including a combination of poor sphincter
tone and pudendal damage leading to poor sensation.
Assessment:
Do PR (overfl ow incontinence? poor tone?) and assess neurological function of legs,
particularly checking sensation.
Refer to a specialist (esp. if rectal prolapse, anal sphincter injury, lumbar disc disease,
or alarm symptoms for colon ca exist). Consider anorectal manometry, pelvic ultra-
sound or MRI, and pudendal nerve testing may be needed.
Treat according to cause and to promote dignity:
Never let your own embarrassment stop you from off ering help. Knowledge and
behaviour are key factors:
• Ensure toilet is in easy reach. Plan trips in the knowledge of toilet locations.
• Obey call-to-stool impulses (esp. after meal, ie the gastro-colic refl ex).
• Ensure access to latest continence aids and advice on use, refer to continence
nurse specialist for assessment.
• Pelvic fl oor rehabilitation: eg can help faecal incontinence, squeeze pressure, and
maximal tolerated volume.
• Loperamide 2–4mg 45min before social engagements may prevent accidents out-
side home. An anal cotton plug may help isolated internal sphincter weakness. Skin
care. Support agencies.
If all sensible measures fail, try a brake-and-accelerator approach: enemas to empty
the rectum (twice weekly) and codeine phosphate, eg 15mg/12h, on non-enema days
to constipate. It’s not a cure, but makes the incontinence manageable.
Flatulence
Normally, 400–1300mL of gas is expelled PR in 8–20 discrete (or indiscrete) episodes
per day. If this, with any eructation (belching) or distension, seems excessive to the
patient, they may complain of fl atulence. Eructation occurs in hiatus hernia—but
most patients with ‘fl atulence’ have no GI disease. Air swal lowing (aerophagy) is the
main cause of fl atus; here N2 is the chief gas. If fl atus is mostly methane, H2 and CO2,
then fermentation by bowel bacteria is the cause, and reducing carbohydrate intake
(eg less lactose and wheat) may help.

Tenesmus
This is a sensation in the rectum of incomplete emptying after defecati on. It’s com-
mon in irritable bowel syndrome (p266), but can be caused by tumours.
Regurgitation
Gastric and oesophageal contents are regurgitated eff ortlessly into the mouth—
without contraction of abdominal muscles and diaphragm (so distinguishing it from
true vomiting). It may be worse on lying fl at, and can cause cough and nocturnal
asthma. Regurgitation is rarely preceded by nausea, and when due to gastro-oe-
sophageal refl ux, it is often associated with heartburn. An oesophageal pouch may
cause regurgitation. Very high GI obstructions (eg gastric volvulus, p611) cause non-
productive retching rather than true regurgitation.
Steatorrhoea
These are pale stools that are diffi cult to fl ush, and are caused by malabsorption of
fat in the small intestine and hence greater fat content in the stool.
Causes: Ileal disease (eg Crohn’s or ileal resection), pancreatic disease, and obstruc-
tive jaundice (due to excretion of bile salts from the gallbladder).
Dyspepsia
Dyspepsia and indigestion (p252) are broad terms. Dyspepsia is defi ned as one or
more of post-prandial fullness, early satiety (unable to fi nish meal), and/or epigastric
or retrosternal pain or burning. ‘Indigestion’ reported by the patient can refer to
dyspepsia, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Try to fi nd out exactly what your pa-
tient means and when these symptoms occur in relation to meals, eg the classic
symptoms of peptic ulcers occur 2–5 hours after a meal and on an empty stomach.
Look for alarm symptoms (see p248); these have high negative predictive value.
If all patients with dyspepsia undergo endoscopy, <33% have clinically signifi cant
fi ndings.11 Myocardial infaction may present as ‘indigestion’.
Halitosis
Halitosis (fetor oris, oral malodour) results from gingivitis (rarely severe enough to
cause Vincent’s angina, p712), metabolic activity of bacteria in plaque, or sulfi de-yield-
ing food putrefaction, eg in gingival pockets and tonsillar crypts. Patients can often be
anxious and convinced of halitosis when it is not present (and vice versa!).
Contributory factors:
Smoking, drugs (disulfi ram; isosorbide), lung disease, hangovers.
:
Try to eliminate anaerobes:
• Good dental hygiene, dental fl oss, tongue scraping.
• 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate.
The very common halitosis arising from the tongue’s dorsum is secondary to over-
populated volatile sulfur compound-producing bacteria. Locally retained bacteria
metabolize sulfur-containing amino acids to yield volatile ( smelly) hydrogen sulfi de
and methylmercaptane, which perpetuate periodontal disease. At night and be-
tween meals, conditions are optimal for odour production—so eating regularly may
help. Treat by mechanical cleansing/scraping using tongue brushes or scrapes plus
mouthwashes. Oral care products containing metal ions, especially Zn, inhibit odour
formation, it is thought, because of affi nity of the metal ion to sulfur. It is possible
to measure the level of volatile sulfur-containing compounds in the air in the mouth
directly by means of a portable sulfi de monitor.

6 Abdomen
Inspection:
• Scars—previous surgery, transplant, stoma
• Visible masses, hernias, or pulsation of AAA
• Visible veins suggesting portal hypertension
• Gynaecomastia, hair loss, acanthosis nigricans
Palpation:
Squat by the bed so that the patient’s abdomen is at
your eye level. Ask if there is any pain and examine
this part last. Watch the patient’s face for signs of
discomfort. Palpate the entire abdomen (see p565):
• Light palpation—if this elicits pain, check for re-
bound tenderness. Any involuntary tension in mus-
cles (‘guarding’)? See p606.
• Deep palpation—to detect masses.
• Liver—using the radial border of the index fi nger
aligned with the costal margin start palpation from
the RIF. Press down and ask patient to take a deep
breath. Continue upwards towards the costal mar-
gin until you feel the liver edge.
• Spleen—start palpation in RIF and work towards
the left costal margin asking the patient to take a
deep breath in and feeling for edge of the spleen.
• Kidneys—for each kidney: place one hand behind
patient’s loin, press down on the abdomen with
your other hand and ‘ballot’ the kidney up with your
lower hand against your upper hand (fi g 2.30). Un-
less slim or pathology present, may not be palpable.
• Aorta—palpate midline above umbilicus, is it ex-
pansile? (fi g 2.49, p79).
Percussion:
• Liver—percuss to map upper & lower border of liver.
• Spleen—percuss from border of spleen as palpat-
ed, around to mid-axillary line. Fig 2.30 Ballottement of the

and the previously dull area will be resonant.
Auscultation:
• Bowel sounds—listen just below the umbilicus.
• Bruits—listen over aorta and renal arteries (either
side of midline above umbilicus).
7 To complete the examination
• Palpate for ankle oedema, examine the hernial orifi ces, external genitalia, and
perform a rectal examination. Check the observation chart and dipstick urine.
Top tips
• If you think there is a spleen tip, roll the patient onto their right side and feel
again. This tips the spleen forward and allows you to percuss around to the back.
• Check the back for spider naevi, even if the chest appears clear (look for nephrec-
tomy scars as you do this).
• Light palpation really should be light, to check for tenderness and very large
masses, watching the patient’s face throughout.
• If you suspect voluntary guarding, use the diaphragm of your stethoscope to as-
sist with palpation and distract the patient who will think you are auscultating!

The gastrointestinal system: examination
Inspection
Does your patient appear comfortable or in distress? Look for abnormal contours/
distension. Tattoos? Cushingoid appearance may suggest steroid use post-trans-
plant or IBD. Inspect (and smell) for signs of chronic liver disease:
• Hepatic fetor on breath (p274). • Gynaecomastia. • Clubbing (rare).
• Purpura (purple-stained skin, p344). • Scratch marks. • Muscle wasting.
• Spider naevi (fi g 2.27, p60). • Palmar erythema. • Jaundice.
• Asterixis.
Look for signs of malignancy (cachexia, masses), anaemia, jaundice, Virchow’s node.
From the end of the bed inspect the abdomen for:
• Visible pulsation (aneurysm, p654). • Peristalsis. • Scars. • Masses.
• Striae (stretch marks, eg pregnancy). • Distension. • Genitalia. • Herniae.
If abdominal wall veins look dilated, assess direction of fl ow. In inferior vena caval
(IVC) obstruction, below the umbilicus blood fl ows up; in portal hypertension (caput
medusae), fl ow radiates out from the umbilicus.
The cough test: While looking at the face, ask the patient to cough. If this causes
abdominal pain, fl inching, or a protective movement of hands towards the abdomen,
suspect peritonitis.
Hands
Clubbing, leuconychia (whitening of the nails due to hypoalbuminaemia), koilo-
nychia (‘spooning’ of the nails due to iron, B12, or folate defi ciency), Muehrcke’s lines
(transverse white lines due to hypoalbuminaemia), blue lunulae (bluish discoloura-
tion seen in Wilson’s disease). Palmar erythema (chronic liver disease, pregnancy),
Dupuytren’s contracture (thickening and fi brous contraction of palmar fascia (see
fi g 2.26, p60; alcoholic liver disease)). Hepatic fl ap/asterixis (hepatic encephalopa-
thy, uraemia from renal disease), check pulse and respiratory rate (infection/sepsis?),
palpate for AV fi stulae in the forearm (haemodialysis access in renal failure).
Face
Assess for jaundice, anaemia, xanthelasma (PBC, chronic obstruction), Kayser–Fleis-
cher rings (green-yellow ring at corneal margin seen in Wilson’s disease). Inspect
mouth for angular stomatitis (thiamine, B12, iron defi ciency), pigmentation (Peutz–
Jeghers syndrome, p709, fi g 15.14), telangiectasia (Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome/
hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, p709, fi g 15.12), ulcers (IBD), glossitis (iron,
B12, or folate defi ciency).
Cervical lymph nodes
Palpate for enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow’s node/Troisier’s
sign) (gastric carcinoma?).
Abdomen
Inspect: Look around to the fl anks for nephrectomy scars.
Palpate: Note any masses, tenderness, guarding (involuntary tensing of abdominal
muscles—pain or fear of it), or rebound tenderness (greater pain on removing hand
than on gently depressing abdomen—peritoneal infl ammation); Rovsing’s sign (ap-
pendicitis, p608); Murphy’s sign (cholecystitis, p634). Palpating the liver: Assess size
(see BOX ‘Causes of hepatomegaly’), regularity, smoothness, and tenderness. Pulsa-
tile (tricuspid regurgitation)? The scratch test is another way to fi nd the lower liver
edge (if it is below the costal margin): start with diaphragm of stethoscope at right
costal margin. Gently scratch the abdominal wall, starting in the right lower quad-
rant, working towards the liver edge. A sharp increase in transm ission of the scratch
is heard when the border of the liver is reached. Palpating the spleen: If suspect
splenomegaly but cannot detect it, assess patient in the right lateral position with
your left hand pulling forwards from behind the rib cage. Palpating the kidneys:
See fi g 2.30, p61. May be non palpable unless slim. Enlarged? Nodular? Palpating the
aorta: Normally palpable transmitted pulsation in thin individuals.

Percussion
Confi rm the lower border and defi ne the upper border of the liver and spleen (dull in
the mid-axillary line in the 10th intercostal space). Percuss all regions of abdomen. If
this induces pain, there may be peritoneal infl ammation below (eg an infl amed ap-
pendix). Some experts percuss fi rst, before palpation, because even anxious patients
do not expect this to hurt—so, if it does hurt, this is a very valuable sign. Percuss for
the shifting dullness of ascites (p61 & p604) but ultrasound is a more reliable way of
detecting ascites.
Auscultation
Bowel sounds: absence implies ileus; they are enhanced and tinkl ing in bowel ob-
struction. Listen for bruits in the aorta, renal and femoral arteries.
Further examination Check for hernias (p612), perform a PR examination see BOX
‘Examination of the rectum and anus’.
Examination of the rectum and anus
It is necessary to have a chaperone present for the examination. Explain what
you are about to do. Make sure curtains are pulled. Have the patient lie on their
left side, with knees brought up towards the chest. Use gloves and lubricant. Part
the buttocks and inspect the anus: •A gaping anus suggests a neuropathy or
megarectum. •Symmetry (a tender unilateral bulge suggests an abscess). •Pro-
lapsed piles. •A subanodermal clot may peep out. •Prolapsed rectum (descent of
>3cm when asked to strain, as if to pass a motion). •Anodermatitis (from frequent
soiling). The anocutaneous refl ex tests sensory and motor innervation—on lightly
stroking the anal skin, does the external sphincter briefl y contract?
Press your index fi nger against the side of the anus. Ask the patient to
breathe deeply and insert your fi nger slowly. Feel for masses (haemorrhoids are not
palpable) or impacted stool. Twist your arm so that the pad of your fi nger is feeling
anteriorly. Feel for the cervix or prostate. Note consistency, size, and symmetry of
the prostate. If there is faecal incontinence or concern about the spinal cord, ask the
patient to squeeze your fi nger and note the tone. This is best done with your fi nger
pad facing posteriorly. Note stool or blood on the glove and test for occult blood.
Wipe the anus. Consider proctoscopy (for the anus) or sigmoidoscopy (which
mainly inspects the rectum).
Causes of hepatomegaly
(For hepatosplenomegaly, see p604.)
Malignancy: Metastatic or primary (usually craggy, irregular edge).
Hepatic congestion: Right heart failure—may be pulsatile in tricuspid incompe-
tence, hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd–Chiari syndrome, p696).
Anatomical: Riedel’s lobe (normal variant).
Infection: Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), hepatitis viruses, malaria,
schistosomiasis, amoebic abscess, hydatid cyst.
Haematological: Leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders (eg my-
elofi brosis), sickle-cell disease, haemolytic anaemias.
Others: Fatty liver, porphyria, amyloidosis, glycogen storage disorders.
Splenomegaly
• Abnormally large spleen.
Causes: See p604. If massive, think of: chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofi brosis,
malaria (or leishmaniasis).
Features of the spleen diff erentiating it from an enlarged kidney
• Cannot get above it (ribs overlie the upper border of the spleen).
• Dull to percussion (kidney is usually resonant because of overlying bowel).
• Moves towards RIF with inspiration (kidney tends to move downwards).
• May have palpable notch on its medial side.

The neurological system: history
History This should be taken from the patient and if possible from a close friend or
relative as well for corroboration/discrepancies. The patient’s memory, perception,
or speech may be aff ected by the disorder, making the history diffi cult to obtain.
Note the progression of the symptoms and signs: gradual deterioration (eg tumour)
vs intermittent exacerbations (eg multiple sclerosis) vs rapid onset (eg stroke). Ask
about age, occupation, and ethnic origin. Right- or left-hand dominant?
Presenting symptoms
• Headache: (p456 & p780.) Diff erent to usual headaches? Acute/chronic? Speed
of onset? Single/recurrent? Unilateral/bilateral? Associated symptoms (eg aura
with migraine, p458)? Any meningism (p822)? Worse on waking (ICP)? Decreased
conscious level? Take a ‘worst-ever’ headache very seriously. (See p749.)
• Muscle weakness: (p466.) Speed of onset? Muscle groups aff ected? Sensory loss?
Any sphincter disturbance? Loss of balance? Associated spinal/root pain?
• Visual disturbance: (OHCS p410.) eg blurring, double vision (diplopia), photophobia,
visual loss. Speed of onset? Any preceding symptoms? Pain in eye?
• Change in other senses: Hearing (p464), smell, taste? Abnormalities are not al-
ways due to neurological disease, consider ENT disease.
• Dizziness: (p462.) Illusion of surroundings moving (vertigo)? Hearing loss/tinnitus?
Any loss of consciousness? Positional?
• Speech disturbance: (p86.) Diffi culty in expression, articulation, or comprehension
(can be diffi cult to determine)? Sudden onset or gradual?

Cognitive state If there is any doubt about the patient’s cognition, cognitive testing
should be undertaken. There are a number of tools including MMSE (subject to strict
copyright), GPCOG, TYM, and 6-CIT. The Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) is a
commonly used screening questionnaire for cognitive impairment:12

Past medical history Ask about meningitis/encephalitis, head/spine trauma, sei-
zures, previous operations, risk factors for vascular disease (p470, AF, hypertension,
hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, smoking), and recent travel, especially exotic destina-
tions. Is there any chance that the patient is pregnant (eclampsia, OHCS p48)?
Drug history Any anticonvulsant/antipsychotic/antidepressant medication? Any
psychotropic drugs (eg ecstasy)? Any medication with neurological side-eff ects (eg
isoniazid which can cause a peripheral neuropathy)?
Social and family history What can the patient do/not do, ie activities of daily
living (ADLs)? What’s the Barthel Index score? Any family history of neurological
or psychiatric disease? Any consanguinity? Consider sexual history, eg syphilis.

Cramp
This is painful muscle spasm. Leg cramps are com mon at night or after heavy exer-
cise, and in patients with renal impairment or on dialysis. Cramp can signify salt de-
pletion, and rarely: muscle ischaemia (claudication, DM), myopathy (McArdle, p704),
or dystonia (writer’s cramp, p469). Forearm cramps suggest motor neuron disease.
Night cramps may respond to quinine bisulfate 300mg at night PO.
Drugs causing cramp: Diuretics (? from K+), domperidone, salbutamol/terbutaline
IVI, ACE-i, telmisartan, celecoxib, lacidipine, ergot alkaloids, levothyroxine.
Paraesthesiae
‘Pins and needles’, numbness/tingling, which can hurt or ‘burn’ (dysaest h esia).
Causes:
Metab olic, Ca2+ (perioral); PaCO2; myxoedema; neurotoxins (tick bite; sting). Vascular,
arterial emboli; Raynaud’s; DVT; high plasma viscosity. Antib ody-mediated, paraneo-
plastic; SLE; ITP. Infection, rare: Lyme; rabies. Drugs, ACE-i. Brain,thalamic/parietal le-
sions. Cord, MS; myelitis/HIV; B12; lumbar fractu re. Plexopathy/monon europathy,
see p502, cervical rib; carpal tunn el; sciatica. Peripheral neuropathy, glove & stocking,
p504, eg DM; CKD. If paroxysmal, migraine; epilepsy; phaeochromocytoma. If wander-
ing, take travel history, consider infection, eg strongyloides.
Tremor
Tremor is rhythmic oscillation of limbs, trunk, head, or tongue. Three types:
1 Resting tremor—worst at rest—eg from parkinsonism (±bradykinesia and rigidity;
tremor is more resistant to treatment than other symptoms). It is usually a slow
tremor (frequency of 3–5Hz), typically ‘pill-rolling’ of the thumb over a fi nger.
2 Postural tremor—worst if arms are outstretched. Typically rapid (8–12Hz). May
be exaggerated physiological tremor (eg anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol, drugs),
due to brain damage (eg Wilson’s disease, syphilis) or benign essential tremor
(BET). This is often familial (autosomal dominant) tremor of arms and head pre-
senting at any age. Cogwheeling may occur but there is no brady kinesia. It is sup-
pressed by alcohol, and patients may self-medicate rather than admit problems.
Rarely progressive (unless onset is unilateral). Propranolol (40–80mg/8–12h PO) can
help, but not in all patients.
3 Intention tremor—worst on movement, seen in cerebellar disease, with past-
pointing and dysdiadochokinesis (see p499). No eff ective drug has been found.
Facial pain
CNS causes: Migraine, trigeminal, or glossopharyngeal neuralgia (p457) or from any
other pain-sensitive structure in the head or neck. Post-herpetic neuralgia: nasty
burning-and-stabbing pain involves dermatomal areas aff ected by shingles (p404);
it may aff ect cranial nerves V and VII in the face. It all too often becomes chronic
and intractable (skin aff ected is exquisitely sensitive). Treatment is hard. Always
give strong psychological support. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation, capsaicin oint-
ment, and infi ltrating local anaesthetic are tried. Neuropathic pain agents, such as
amitriptyline, eg 10–25mg/24h at night, or gabapentin (p504) may help. NB: famciclo-
vir or valaciclovir given in acute shingles may  duration of neuralgia.14
Vascular and non-neurological causes:
• Neck—cervical disc pathology.
• Bone/sinuses—sinusitis; neoplasia.
• Eye—glaucoma; iritis; orbital cellulitis; eye strain; AVM.
• Temporomandibular joint—arthritis or idiopathic dysfunction (common).
• Teeth/gums—caries; broken teeth; abscess; malocclusion.
• Ear—otitis media; otitis externa.
• Vascular/vasculitis—arteriovenous fi stula; aneurysm; or AVM at the cerebellopon-
tine angle; giant cell arteritis; SLE.

Neurological examination of the upper limbs
The neurological system is usually the most daunting examination, so learn at the
bedside from a senior colleague, preferably a neurologist. Keep practising. Be aware
that books present ideal situations: often one or more signs are equivocal or even
contrary to expectation; consider signs in the context of the history and try re-ex-
amining the patient, as signs may evolve over time. The only essential point is to
distinguish whether weakness is upper (UMN) or lower (LMN) motor neuron (p446).
Position the patient comfortably, sitting up at 45° and with arms exposed. The order
of examination should be Inspection, Tone, Power, Refl exes, Coordination, Sensation
(fi g 2.31).
1 General inspection
Abnormal posturing, asymmetry, abnormal move-
ments (fasciculation/tremor/dystonia/athetosis),
muscle wasting (especially small muscles of the
hand)—symmetrical/asymmetrical? Local/general?
2 Tone
Ask patient to ‘relax/go fl oppy like a rag-doll’. Ask if
patient has any pain in hands/arm/shoulder before
passively fl exing and extending limb while also pro-
nating and supinating the forearm. Any spasticity
or rigidity?
3 Power
Direct patient to adopt each position and follow
commands while you as the examiner stabilize the
joint above and resist movements as appropriate
to grade power (see BOX ‘Muscle weakness grading’
on p446). Test each muscle group bilaterally before
moving on to the next position. See p452–3 for
myotomes.
• ‘Shrug your shoulders and don’t let me push
down; push your arms out to the side against me;
try to pull them back in.’
• ‘Hold your arms up like this and pull me towards
you, now push me away.’
• ‘Hold your hand out fl at, don’t let me push it
down; now don’t let me push it up.’
• Off er the patient two (crossed) fi ngers of yours
and ask them to ‘squeeze my fi ngers.’
• Ask patient to ‘spread your fi n gers and stop me
pushing them back together’, then hand the pa-
tient a piece of paper to grip between two fi ngers.
You as the examiner should grip the paper with
your corresponding fi ngers while asking patient to
‘grip the paper and don’t let me pull it away.’

4 Refl exes
For each refl ex, test right, then left and com-
pare. If absent, attempt to elicit with ‘rein-
forcement’ by asking patient to clench their
teeth on a count of three, at which time you
strike (Jendrassik manoeuvre). Are refl exes
absent/present (with reinforcement)/nor-
mal/brisk/exaggerated? •Biceps (C5,6) •Tri-
ceps (C7) •Supinator (C6).
5 Coordination
Holding your fi nger in front of the patient
instruct ‘touch my fi nger then your nose…as
fast as you can’. Look for intention tremor, and
‘past pointing’.
• Test for dysdiadokokinesis: ask patient to
repeatedly pronate and supinate forearm,
tapping hands each time. Test both limbs.
You may have to demonstrate. Failure to
perform rapidly alternating movements is
dysdiadokokinesis.
• Test for pronator drift: with patient’s eyes
closed and arms outstretched, tap down on
their up-facing palms and look for a failure to
maintain supination.
6 Sensation
• Light touch: Use cotton wool, touch (not rub) it to
sternum fi rst—‘this is what it should feel like, tell
me where you feel it and if it feels diff erent’. Pro-
ceed to test with cotton wool in all dermatomes
(see p454), comparing left and right.
• Pin prick: Repeat as above using a neurological pin,
asking patient to tell you if it feels sharp or dull.
• Temperature: Repeat as above, alternating hot and
cold probes. Can the patient tell hot from cold?
• Vibration: Using a 128Hz tuning fork (128 vibrate!)
confi rm with patient that they ‘can feel a buzzing’
when you place the tuning fork on their sternum.
Fig 2.31 Sensory dermatomes. Proceed to test at the most distal bony promi-
nence and move proximally by placing the buzzing

• Proprioception: With the patient’s eyes closed
grasp distal phalanx of the index fi nger at the
sides, not on top. Stabilize the rest of the fi nger.
Flex and extend the joint, stopping at intervals to
ask whether the fi nger tip is up or down.
Top tips
• Use the tendon hammer like a pendulum, let it drop, don’t grip it too tightly.
• Ensure you are testing light touch, not stroke sensation.

Neurological examination of the lower limbs
If the patient is able, begin your examination by asking the patient to remove their
lower garments down to underwear, and to walk across the room. Gait analysis
(p467) gives you more information than any other test. If they aren’t able to walk,
start with them lying down, legs fully exposed. Then, Inspection, Tone, Refl exes,
Power, Coordination, Sensation (fi g 2.32).
1 General inspection and gait
Gait: Ask patient to walk a few metres, turn, and walk back
to you. Note use of walking aids, symmetry, size of paces, arm
swing. Ask patient to ‘walk heel-to-toe as if on a tightrope’
to exaggerate any instability. Ask patient to walk on tiptoes,
then on heels. Inability to walk on tiptoes indicates S1 or
gastrocn emius lesion. Inability to walk on heels indicates L4,5
lesion or foot drop.
Romberg’s test: Ask patient to stand unaided with arms by
their sides and close their eyes (be ready to support them).
If they sway/lose balance the test is positive and indicates
posterior column disease/sensory ataxia.
Inspect: Abnormal posturing, muscle wasting, fasciculation
(LMN lesion?), deformities of the foot (eg pes cavus of Frie-
dreich’s ataxia or Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease). Is one leg
smaller than the other (old polio, infantile hemiplegia)?
2 Tone
Ask patient to ‘relax/go fl oppy like a rag-doll’. Ask if they have
any pain in feet/legs/hips before passively fl exing and extend-
ing each limb while also internally and externally rotating. Hold
the patient’s knee and roll it from side to side. Put your hand
behind the knee and raise it quickly. The heel should lift slightly
from the bed if tone is normal. Any spasticity/rigidity?
Clonus: Plantar fl ex the foot then quickly dorsifl ex and hold.
More than 3 ‘beats’ of plantar fl exion is sustained clonus and
is abnormal. Clonus can also be elicited at the patella with
F
rapid downward movement of patella. Hypertonia and clonus
lo
suggest an upper motor neuron lesion.

3 Refl exes f
For each refl ex, test right, then left and compare. If absent,
attempt to elicit with ‘reinforcement’. Decide whether refl exes
are absent/present (with reinforcement)/normal/brisk/exag-
gerated.
• Knee: (L3,4.) Strike on the patella tendon, just below the
patella.
• Ankle: (L5,S1.) Several accepted methods; ideally ask the
patient to slightly bend the knee, then drop it laterally,
grasp the foot and dorsifl ex, then strike the Achilles
tendon. If hip pain limits mobility, dorsifl ex the foot with a
straight leg and strike your hand, feeling for an ankle jerk.
• Plantar refl exes: (L5, S1, S2.) Stroke the patient’s sole with
an orange stick or similar. The normal refl ex is downward
movement of the great toe. Babinski’s sign is positive if
there is dorsifl exion of the great toe (this is abnormal (up-
per motor neuron lesion) if patient age >6 months).

4 Power
Direct patient to adopt position and follow the following
commands while you as the examiner resist movements as
appropriate to grade power (p446). Test each muscle group
bilaterally before moving on to the next position. See pp452–3
for myotomes.
• Hip fl exion: ‘Keeping your leg straight, can you lift your
leg off the bed, don’t let me push it down.’
• Hip extension: ‘And now using your leg, push my hand
into the bed.’
• Hip abduction: Position hands on outer thighs—‘push
your legs out to the sides.’
• Hip adduction: Position hands on inner thighs—‘and
push your legs together.’
• Knee fl exion and extension: ‘Bend your knee and bring
your heel to your bottom, don’t let me pull it away… and
now kick out against me and push me away.’
• Ankle plantar fl exion: With your hand on the underside
of the patient’s foot ask them to ‘bend your foot down,
pushing my hand away.’
• Ankle dorsifl exion: Put your hand on the dorsum of the
foot and ask them to ‘lift up your foot, point your toes at
the ceiling, don’t let me push your foot down.’
5 Coordination
Heel–shin test: Using your fi nger on the patient’s shin to
demonstrate, instruct patient to ‘put your heel just below
your knee then run it smoothly down your shin, lift it up
and place it back on your knee, now run it down again’, etc.
Repeat on the other side. Also, fast alternate foot tapping
onto examiners’s hands with patient lying down.

• Joint position sense: With the patient’s eyes closed grasp
distal phalanx of the great toe at the sides. Stabilize the
rest of the toe. Move the joint up and tell patient ‘this is
up’, and down, saying ‘this is down’. Flex and extend the
joint, stopping at intervals to ask whether the toe is up
or down.
Top tips
• If you are limited for time, gait is the most useful test to start with.
• Make sure you test each muscle group individually by stabilizing above the joint
you are testing.
• Test vibration by putting a buzzing tuning fork on the bony part of a joint (most
distal point) with the patient’s eyes closed then ask them to tell you when the
buzzing stops (pinch the tuning fork to stop it) to distinguish vibration from
pressure sensation.

Cranial nerve examination
Approach to examining the cranial nerves Where
Cranial nerve names
is the lesion? Think systematically. Is it in the brain-
stem (eg MS) or outside, pressing on the brainstem? I olfactory
Is it the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia) or the II optic
muscles (eg a dystrophy)? Cranial nerves may be af- III oculomotor
fected singly or in groups. Face the patient (helps IV trochlear
spot asymmetry). For causes of lesions see BOX ‘Caus- V1 ophthalmic division
es of cranial nerve lesions’.
V2 maxillary division
• I: Smell—test ability of each nostril (separately) to
distinguish familiar smells, eg coff ee. V3 mandibular division
• II: Acuity—test each eye separately, and its correct- VI abducens
ability with glasses or pin-hole; use Snellen chart, or VII facial
the one inside the cover of this book. Visual fi elds— VIII vestibulo cochlear
compare with your own fi elds or formally via perim- IX glossopharyngeal
etry testing. Any losses/inattention? Sites of lesions: X vagus
OHCS p428. Pupils (p72)—size, shape, symmetry, reac- XI accessory
tion to light (direct and consensual) or accommoda- XII hypoglossal
tion. Swinging light test for relative aff erent pupillary
defect. Ophthalmoscopy (OHCS, p414)—best learnt from an ophthalmologist and dilat-
ing drops help! Darken the room, warn the patient you will need to get close to their
face. Focus the lens on the optic disc (pale? swollen?). Follow vessels outwards to view
each quadrant. If the view is obscured, examine the red refl ex, with your focus on the
margin of the pupil, to look for a cataract. Try to get a view of the fovea by asking the
patient to look directly at the ophthalmoscope Pathology here needs prompt oph-
thalmic review. If in doubt, ask for slit lamp examination or photography of the retina.
• III p, IV, & VI—eye movements. Ask the patient to keep their head still and follow
your fi nger as you trace an imaginary ‘H’. IIIrd nerve palsy—ptosis, large pupil,
eye down and out. IVth nerve palsy—diplopia on looking down and in (often no-
ticed on descending stairs)—head tilting compensates for this (ocular torticollis).
VIth nerve palsy—horizontal diplopia on looking out. Nystagmus is involuntary,
often jerky, eye oscillations. Horizontal nystagmus is often due to a vestibular le-
sion (acute: nystagmus away from lesion; chronic: towards lesion), or cerebellar
lesion (unilateral lesions cause nystagmus towards the aff ected side). If it is more
in whichever eye is abducting, MS may be the cause (internuclear ophthalmoplegia,
see fi g 2.34). If also deafness/tinnitus, suspect a peripheral cause (eg VIIIth nerve
lesion, barotrauma, Ménière’s, p462). If it varies with head position, suspect benign
positional vertigo (p462). If it is up-and-down, ask a neurologist to review—upbeat
nystagmus classically occurs with lesions in the midbrain or at the base of the 4th
ventricle, downbeat nystagmus in foramen magnum lesions. Nystagmus lasting ≤2
beats is normal, as is nystagmus at the extremes of gaze.
• V: Motor palsy—‘Open your mouth’; jaw deviates to side of lesion, muscles of mas-
tication (temporalis, masseter and pterygoids). Sensory—check all three divisions.
Consider corneal refl ex (lost fi rst).
• VII: p Facial nerve lesions cause droop and weakness. As the forehead has bilateral
representation in the brain, only the lower two-thirds is aff ected in UMN lesions, but
all of one side of the face in LMN lesions. Ask to ‘raise your eyebrows’, ‘show me your
teeth’, ‘puff out your cheeks’. Test taste with salt/sweet solutions (supplies anterior
two-thirds of tongue).
• VIII: Hearing—p464. Ask to repeat a number whispered in an ear while you block
the other. Perform Weber’s and Rinne’s tests (p464). Balance/vertigo—p462.
• IX p & X: p Gag refl ex—ask the patient to say ‘Ah’. Xth nerve lesions also cause the pal-
ate to be pulled to the normal side on saying ‘Ah’, uvula deviates away. Ask them to
swallow a sip of water. Consider gag refl ex—touch the back of the soft palate with
an orange stick. The aff erent arm of the refl ex involves IX; the eff erent arm involves X.
• XI: Trapezii—‘Shrug your shoulders’ against resistance. Sternocleidomastoid:
‘Turn your head to the left/right’ against resistance.
• XII: Tongue movement—the tongue deviates to the side of the lesion.

Causes of cranial nerve lesions
Any cranial nerve may be aff ected by diabetes mellitus; stroke; MS; tumours; sar-
coidosis; vasculitis (p556), eg PAN (p556), SLE (p554); syphilis. Chronic menin gitis
(malignant, TB, or fungal) tends to pick off the lower cranial nerves one by one.
• I: Trauma; respiratory tract infection; meningitis; frontal lobe tumour.
• II: Field defects may start as small areas of visual loss (scotomas, eg in glaucoma).
Monocular blindness—lesions of one eye or optic nerve eg MS, giant cell arteritis.
Bilateral blindness4—any cause of mononeuritis, eg diabetes, MS; rarely methanol,
neurosyphilis. Field defects—bitemporal hemianopia—optic chiasm compres-
sion, eg pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, internal carotid artery aneurysm
(fi g 10.3, p451). Homonymous hemianopia—aff ects half the visual fi eld contralat-
eral to the lesion in each eye. Lesions lie beyond the chiasm in the tracts, radiation,
or occipital cortex, eg stroke, abscess, tumour. Optic neuritis (pain on moving
eye, loss of central vision, relative aff erent pupillary defect, disc swelling from
papillitis5)—causes demyelination (eg MS); rarely sinusitis, syphilis, collagen vas-
cular disorders. Ischaemic papillopathy—swelling of optic disc due to stenosis
of the posterior ciliary artery (eg in giant cell arteritis). Papilloedema (bilateral-
ly swollen discs, fi g 12.20, p560)—most commonly ICP (tumour, abscess, enceph-
alitis, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension); rarer: retro-orbital
lesion (eg cavernous sinus thrombosis, p480). Optic atrophy (pale optic discs
and reduced acuity)—MS; frontal tumours; Friedreich’s ataxia; retinitis pigmen-
tosa; syphilis; glaucoma; Leber’s optic atrophy; chronic optic nerve compression.
• III: c Alone c—‘medical’ causes (pupillary sparing): diabetes; HTN; giant cell arteri-
tis; syphilis; idiopathic. ‘Surgical’ causes (early pupil involvement due to external
compression of nerve damaging parasympathetic fi bres): posterior communi-
cating artery aneurysm (+ surgery) ICP (if uncal herniation through the tento-
rium compresses the nerve); tumours.
• IV:c Alone—rare and usually due to trauma to the orbit.
• V: c Sensory—trigeminal neuralgia (pain but no sensory loss, p457); herpes zoster,
nasopharyngeal cancer, acoustic neuroma (p462). Motor—rare.
• VI: c Alone—MS, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, false localizing sign in ICP, pontine
stroke (presents with fi xed small pupils ± quadriparesis).
• VII: LMN—Bell’s palsy (p500), polio, otitis media, skull fracture; cerebellopontine
angle tumours, eg acoustic neuroma, malignant parotid tumours, herpes zoster
(Ramsay Hunt syndrome p501, OHCS p652). UMN—(spares the forehead, because
of its bilateral cortical representation), stroke, tumour.
• VIII: (p462 & p464.) Noise damage, Paget’s disease, Ménière’s disease, herpes
zoster, acoustic neuroma, brainstem CVA, drugs (eg aminoglycosides).
• IX, X, XI: Trauma, brainstem lesions, neck tumours.
• XII: Rare. Polio, syringomyelia, tumour, stroke, bulbar palsy, trauma, TB.
Groups of cranial nerves:
VIII, then V, VI, IX, & X: cerebellopontine angle tumours, eg acoustic neuroma (p462;
facial weakness is not a prominent sign). III, IV & VI: stroke, tumours, Wernicke’s
enceph alopathy; aneurysms, MS. III, IV, Va, & VI: cavernous sinus thrombosis, supe-
rior orbital fi ssure lesions (Tolosa–Hunt syndrome, OHCS p654). IX, X, & XI: jugular
foramen lesion. : myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy,
mononeuritis multiplex (p502).
Top tips
If the patient is able to shake their head, there is no meningism.
4 Remember the commonest cause of monocular or binocular blindness is not a cranial nerve lesion but
a problem with the eye itself (cataracts, retinal problems). Neurological disorders more commonly cause
loss of part of the visual fi eld.
5 Unilateral disc swelling = papillitis, bilateral papillitis/disc swelling = papilloedema. Check both eyes!
c= structures passing through the cavernous sinus; see BOX ‘Psychiatric symptoms’, p89. NB: Va is the only
division of V to do so.
p= Remember that these cranial nerves carry parasympathetic fi bres. Sympathetic fi bres originate from
the thoracic chain and run with the arterial supply to distribute about the body (see also OHCS, fi g 9.6, p621).

Cranial nerve lesions of the eye
Pupillary abnormalities
Key questions: • Equal, central, circular, dilated, or constricted? • React to light,
directly and consensually? • Constrict normally on convergence/accommodation?
Irregular pupils: Anterior uveitis (iritis), trauma to the eye, syphilis.
Dilated pupils: CN III lesions (inc. ICP, p830) and mydriatic drugs. Always ask: is
this pupil dilated, or is it the other that is constricted?
Constricted pupils: Old age, sympathetic nerve damage (Horner’s, p702, and ptosis,
p73), opiates, miotics (pilocarpine drops for glaucoma), pontine damage.
Unequal pupils (anisocoria): May be due to unilateral lesion, eye-drops, eye surgery,
syphilis, or Holmes–Adie pupil. Some inequality is normal.
Light reaction: Test: cover one eye and shine light into the other obliquely. Both
pupils should constrict, one by direct, other by consensual light refl ex (fi g 2.33). The
lesion site is deduced by knowing the pathway: from the retina the message passes
up the optic nerve (CNII) to the superior colliculus (midbrain) and thence to the CNIII
nuclei on both sides. The IIIrd cranial nerve causes pupillary constriction. If a light in
one eye causes only contralateral constriction, the defect is ‘eff erent’, as the aff erent
pathways from the retina being stimulated must be intact. Test for relative afferent
pupillary defect: move torch quickly from pupil to pupil. If there has been incomplete
damage to the aff erent pathway, the aff ected pupil will paradoxically dilate when
light is moved from the normal eye to the abnormal eye. This is because, in the face
of reduced aff erent input from the aff ected eye, the consensual pupillary relaxation
response from the normal eye predominates. This is the Marcus Gunn sign, and may
occur after apparent complete recovery from the initial lesion.
Reaction to accommodation/convergence: If the patient fi rst looks at a distant
object and then at the examiner’s fi nger held a few inches away, the eyes will con-
verge and the pupils constrict. Aff erent fi bres in each optic nerve pass to the lateral
geniculate bodies. Impulses then pass to the pre-tectal nucleus and then to the para-
sympathetic nuclei of the IIIrd cranial nerves, causing pupillary constriction.
• Holmes–Adie (myotonic) pupil: The aff ected pupil is normally moderately dilated
and is poorly reactive to light, if at all. It is slowly reactive to accommodation; wait
and watch carefully: it may eventually constrict more than a normal pupil. It is often
associated with diminished or absent ankle and knee refl exes, in which case the
Holmes–Adie syndrome is present. Usually a benign incidental fi nding. Rare causes:
Lyme disease, syphilis, parvovirus B19, HSV, autoimmunity. >.
• Argyll Robertson pupil: This occurs in neurosyphilis. The pupil is constricted and
unreactive to light, but reacts to accommodation. Other possible causes: Lyme
disease; HIV; zoster; diabetes mellitus; sarcoidosis; MS; paraneoplastic; B12. The
iris may be patchily atrophied, irregular, and depigmented. The lesion site is not
always near the Edinger–Westphal nucleus or even in the midbrain. Pseudo-Argyll
Robertson pupils occur in Parinaud’s syndrome (p708).
• Hutchinson pupil: This is the sequence of events resulting from rapidly rising uni-
lateral intracranial pressure (eg in intracerebral haemorrhage). The pupil on the
side of the lesion fi rst constricts then widely dilates. The other pupil then goes
through the same sequence. See p830.
Fig 2.33 Light refl ex. Action potentials go
along optic nerve (red), traversing optic
chiasm, passing synapses at pre-tectal nu-
cleus, en route to Edinger–Westphal nuclei
of CNIII. These send fi bres to both irises’
ciliary muscles (so both pupils constrict)
via ciliary ganglion (also relays accom-
modation and corneal sensation, and gets
sympathetic roots from C8–T2, carrying
fi bres to dilate pupil).

Fig 2.34 Internuclear ophthal-
moplegia (INO) and its causes. To
produce synchronous eye move-
ments, cranial nerves III, IV, and
VI communicate through medial
long itu dinal fasciculus in midbrain.
In INO, a lesion disrupts commu n-
i cation, causing weakness in ad-
duction of the ipsilate ral eye with
nystagmus of the contralateral eye
only when abducting. There may be
incomplete or slow abduction of the
ipsilateral eye during lateral gaze.
Convergence is preserved. Causes
MS or vascular (rarely: HIV; syphilis;
Lyme disease; brainstem tumours;
phenothiazine toxicity).
Ptosis
Drooping of the upper eyelid. Best observed with patient sitting up, with head held
by examiner. Oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates main muscle concerned (levator
palpebrae), but nerves from the cervical sympathetic chain innervate superior tar-
sal muscle, and a lesion of these nerves causes mild ptosis which can be overcome
on looking up. Causes:
1 CN III lesions cause unilateral complete ptosis: look for other evidence of a
CN III lesion: ophtha lmoplegia with ‘down and out’ deviation of the eye, pupil
dil ated and unreactive to light or accommodation. If eye pain too, suspect
infi ltration (eg by lymphoma or sarcoidosis). If  T° or consciousness, suspect
infection (any tick bites?).
2 Sympathetic paralysis usually causes unilateral partial ptosis. Look for other
evidence of a sympathetic lesion, as in Horner’s syndrome (p702): constricted
pupil = miosis, lack of sweating on same side of the face (=anhidrosis).
3 Myopathy, eg dystrophia myotonica, myasthenia gravis (cause bilateral partial
ptosis).
4 Congenital; usually partial and without other CNS signs.
Visual loss
Get ophthalmology help. See OHCS p434–p455. Consider:
• Is the eye red? (Glaucoma, uveitis p561.)
• Pain? Giant cell arteritis: severe temporal headache, jaw claudication, scalp ten-
derness, ESR:  urgent steroids (p556). Optic neuritis: eg in MS.
• Is the cornea cloudy: corneal ulcer (OHCS p435), glaucoma (OHCS p433)?
• Is there a contact lens problem (infection)?
• Any fl ashes/fl oaters? (TIA, migraine, retinal detachment?)
• Is there a visual fi eld problem (stroke, space-occupying lesion, glaucoma)?
• Are there any focal CNS signs?
• Any valvular heart disease/carotid bruits (emboli)? Hyperlipidaemia (p690)?
• Is there a relative aff erent pupillary defect (p72)?
• Any past history of trauma, migraine, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, MS,
diabetes or connective tissue disease?
• Any distant signs: eg HIV (causes retinitis), SLE, sarcoidosis?
Sudden: • Acute glaucoma • Retinal detachment • Vitreous haemorrhage (eg
in diabetic proliferative retinopathy) • Central retinal artery or vein occlusion
• Migraine • CNS: TIA (amaurosis fugax), stroke, space-occupying lesion • Optic neu-
ritis (eg MS) • Temporal arteritis • Drugs: quinine/methanol • Pituitary apoplexy.
Gradual: • Optic atrophy • Chronic glaucoma • Cataracts • Macular degeneration
• Tobacco amblyopia.

Musculoskeletal hand examination 1
Begin by introducing yourself, obtaining consent to examine and position the patient
appropriately. Expose the arms, then ask the patient to rest their hands on a pillow.
Start by examining the dorsal surface and then turn the hands over. Always ask
about pain or tender areas. Follow the ‘look, ask the patient to move, then feel’ to
avoid causing pain.
Skin
On both the palm and the dorsum start by
inspecting the skin for:
1 Colour—pigmentation of creases, jaundice,
palmar erythema (fi g 2.44).
2 Consistency—tight (sclerodactyly), thick
(DM, acromegaly) (fi g 2.39).
3 Characteristic lesions—pulp infarcts,
rashes, purpura, spider naevi, telangiecta-
sia, tophi (fi g 2.35), scars (eg carpal tunnel
release). Fig 2.35 Gouty tophi.
Nails
Look for the same skin changes
as the palm, plus tendon xan-
thomata, plaques, and joint re-
placement scars, and examine
the nails for:
• Pitting and onycholysis (p76).
• Clubbing (p77).
• Nail fold infarcts and splinter
haemorrhages.
• Other lesions, eg Beau’s lines
Fig 2.36 Leuconychia.
(fi g 2.41, p76), koilonychia,
leuconychia (fi g 2.36).
Muscles
Examine the muscles for wasting and fascicu-
lations; on the dorsal surface look for wasting,
particularly of dorsal interossei. On the palm
look particularly at the thenar and hypothenar
eminences.
• Thenar wasting (fi g 2.37) = median nerve
lesion.
• Generalized wasting, particularly of the
interossei on the dorsum, but sparing of the
thenar eminence = ulnar nerve lesion.
Also look for Dupuytren's contracture and Fig 2.37 Thenar wasting.
perform Tinel's test (percuss over the distal
skin crease of the wrist). Phalen's test (patient
holds dorsal surfaces of both hands together
for 60 seconds). Both tests are positive if tin-
gling reported, suggesting carpal tunnel syn-
drome.

Joints
Examine for acute infl ammation (swol-
len, red joints) as well as the charac-
teristic deformities of chronic arthritis,
eg rheumatoid, osteoarthritis (fi g 2.38).
• Ulnar deviation at the wrist.
• Z deformity of the thumb.
• Swan-neck (fl exed DIP, hyperextended
Fig 2.38 Osteoarthritis. PIP—fi g 12.2, p540).
• Boutonnière (hyperextended DIP,
fl exed PIP).
• Heberden’s nodes (DIP joints, p77).
• Bouchard’s nodes (PIP joints).
Move and feel
By this point, you should know the likely
diagnosis, so assess neurological func-
tion looking at power, function, and sen-
sation:
• Wrist and forearm: Extension (prayer
position) and fl exion (reverse prayer),
supination and pronation. Look at the
elbows.
• Small muscles: Pincer grip, power grip
(squeeze my two fi ngers), abduction of
the thumb, abduction (spread your fi n-
gers), and adduction (grip this piece of
paper between your fi ngers) of the fi n-
gers. NB Froment's sign = fl exion of the
Fig 2.39 Sclerosis. thumb during grip as ulnar nerve lesion
prevents adduction (p453).
• Function: Write a sentence, undo a but-
ton, pick up a coin.
• Sensation: Test little fi nger (ulnar),
index fi nger (median), and anatomi-
cal snuff box (radial) using light touch/
pinprick.
When you have clinched the diagnosis
and functional status, examine each joint,
palpating for tenderness, eff usions, and
crepitus. Test sensation (see p67) and ex-
amine the elbows. Consider examination
of upper limbs and face.
Top tips
• Cross your fi ngers before the patient grips them, it hurts less!
• Don’t forget to palpate the radial pulse.
• Don’t forget to look at the elbows for plaques of psoriasis and rheumatoid nodules.

Musculoskeletal hand examination 2
The hands can give you a wealth of information about a patient. Shaking hands can
tell you about thyroid disease (warm, sweaty, tremor), anxiety (cold, sweaty), and
neurological disease (myotonic dystrophy patients have diffi culty relaxing their grip,
a weak grip may suggest muscle wasting or peripheral neuropathy). The nails and
skin can inform about systemic disease:
Nail abnormalities
• Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, fi g 2.40) suggests
iron defi ciency, haemochromatosis, infection (eg
fungal), endocrine disorders (eg acromegaly, hypo-
thyroidism), or malnutrition.
• Onycholysis (detachment of the nail from the nail-
bed) is seen with hypert hyroidism, fungal infection,
and psoriasis.

cal stress: severe infection. Nails grow at ~0.1mm/d,
the furrow’s distance from the cuticle allows dating
of the stress.
• Mees’ lines are single white transverse bands clas-
sically seen in arsenic poisoning, chronic kidney dis-
ease, and carbon monoxide poisoning among others.
• Muehrcke’s lines are paired white parallel trans-
verse bands (without furrowing of the nail itself, Fig 2.41 Beau’s lines, here due
distinguishing them from Beau’s lines) seen, eg, in to chemotherapy, a new line is

lagra (p268), chronic kidney disease.
• Terry’s nails: Proximal portion of nail is white/
pink, nail tip is red/brown (causes include cirrhosis,
chronic kidney disease, congestive cardiac failure).
• Pitting is seen in psoriasis and alopecia areata.
• Splinter haemorrhages (fi g 2.42) are fi ne longitudi-
nal haemorrhagic streaks (under the nails), which in
the febrile patient may suggest infective endocardi-
tis. They may be microemboli, or be normal—eg due Fig 2.42 Splinter haemor-

• Nail-fold infarcts: Embolic, typically seen in vascu-
litic disorders (OHCS, p452).
• Nail clubbing See p77.
• Chronic paronychia is a chronic infection of the

intermittent discharge (fi g 2.43).

Clubbing
Fingernails (± toenails) have increased curvature in all directions and loss of the
angle between nail and nail fold and feel boggy (fi gs 2.46, 2.47). Pathogenesis is
unclear although the platelet theory was developed in 1987.16 Megakaryocytes are
normally fragmented into platelets in the lungs, and the original theory was that
any disruption to normal pulmonary circulation (infl ammation, cancer, cardiac
right-to-left shunting) would allow large megakaryocytes into the systemic cir-
culation. They become lodged in the capillaries of the fi ngers and toes, releasing
platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which lead
to tissue growth, vascular permeability, and recruitment of infl ammatory cells.
Evidence showing platelet microthrombi in clubbed fi ngers, and high levels of PDGF
and VEGF in patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, support the theory. This
does not explain the changes in patients with unilateral clubbing, usually seen in
neurological disorders.
Causes
Thoracic: GI: Cardiovascular:
• Bronchial cancer (clubbing is • Infl ammatory bowel dis-• Cyanotic

• Chronic lung suppuration: • GI lymphoma • Endocarditis

• Bronchiectasis • Aneurysms
• Cystic fi brosis • Infected grafts.
• Fibrosing alveolitis Rare:
• Mesothelioma • Familial
• TB. • Thyroid acropachy (p562).
Unilateral clubbing:
• Hemiplegia
• Vascular lesions, eg upper-limb artery aneurysm, Takayasu’s arteritis, brachial
arteriovenous malformations (including iatrogenic— haemodialysis fi stulas).

The peripheral vascular system: examination
Arterial
If limb is pale, pulseless, painful, paralysed, paraesthetic, and ‘perishingly cold’ this
is acute ischaemia and is a surgical emergency (see p595 and p657).
1 Inspection: Look for scars of previous surgery and signs of peripheral arterial
disease; loss of hair, pallor, shiny skin, cyanosis, dry skin, scaling, deformed toe-
nails, ulcers, gangrene. Be sure to inspect the pressure points, ie between the
toes and under the heel.
2 Palpation: Skin temperature will be cool in peripheral arterial disease. Is there
a level above which it is warm? Delayed capillary refi ll (>2s) also indicates arte-
rial disease. Are peripheral pulses palpable or not? ‘If you cannot count it, you
are not feeling it.’ Note down on a quick stick-man diagram where they become
palpable. Check for atrial fi brillation or other arrhythmias, as these can be the
cause of embolic disease. Palpate for an enlarged abdominal aorta and attempt
to assess size. (Though don’t press too fi rmly!) An expansile pulsatile mass
in the presence of abdominal symptoms is a ruptured aneurysm until proven
otherwise.
3 Auscultation: The presence of bruits suggests arterial disease. Listen over the
major arteries—carotids, abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac femorals.
4 Special tests: Buerger’s angle is that above the horizontal plane which leads to
development of pallor (<20° indicates severe ischaemia). Buerger’s sign is the
sequential change in colour from white to pink, upon return to the dependent
position; if the limbs become fl ushed red (reactive hyperaemia) this is indicative
of more severe disease.
5 Complete your examination: measure ABPI (p656), US Doppler assessment, and
a neurological examination of the lower limbs.
Venous
(See also p658.)
1 Inspection: Look for any varicosities and decide whether they are the long sa-
phenous vein (medial), short saphenous vein (posterior lateral, below the knee),
or from the calf perforators (usually few varicosities but commonly show skin
changes). Ulcers around the medial malleolus are more suggestive of venous
disease, whereas those at the pressure points suggest arterial pathology. Brown
haemosiderin deposits result from venous hypertension. There may also be atro-
phy and loss of skin elasticity (lipodermatosclerosis) in venous disease.
2 Palpation: Warm varicose veins may indicate infection. Are they tender? Firm,
tender varicosities suggests thrombosis. Palpate the saphenofemoral junction
(SFJ) for a saphena varix which displays a cough impulse. Similarly, incompetence
at the saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ) may be felt as a cough impulse. If ulcera-
tion is present, it is prudent to palpate the arterial pulses to rule out arterial
disease.
3 Tap test: A transmitted percussion impulse from the lower limit of the varicose
vein to the saphenofemoral junction demonstrates incompetence of superfi cial
valves.
4 Auscultation: Bruits over the varicosities means there is an arteriovenous mal-
formation.
5 Doppler: Test for the level of refl ux. On squeezing the leg distal to placement of
the probe you should only hear one ‘whoosh’ if the valves are competent at the
level of probe placement.
6 Trendelenburg’s test assesses if the SFJ valve is competent. Doppler USS has largely
consigned this and other examination methods (eg Tourniquet and Perthes’
test) to the history books.
7 Complete examination: examine the abdomen, pelvis in females, and external
genitalia in males (for masses).

See table 2.11 for direct questions to ask regarding presenting symptoms.
Detecting outfl ow obstruction (See ‘Irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms’
later in topic.) Eg prostatic hyperplasia; stricture; stone. Ask about LUTS (lower uri-
nary tract symptoms).
• On trying to pass water, is there delay before you start? (Hesitancy)
• Does the fl ow stop and start? Do you go on dribbling when you think you’ve
stopped? (Terminal dribbling)
• Is your stream getting weaker? (Poor stream)
• Is your stream painful and slow/‘drop-by-drop’? (eg from bladder stone)
• Do you feel the bladder is not empty after passing water? i
• Do you ever pass water when you do not want to? (Incontinence—p648)
• On feeling an urge to pass water, do you have to go at once? (Urgency)i
• Do you urinate often at night? (Nocturia) i In the day? (Frequency)i How often?
Past history Renal colic, urinary tract infection, diabetes, BP, gout, analgesic use
(p318), previous operations.
Drug history Anticholinergics, prophylactic antibiotics.
Family history Prostate carcinoma? Renal disease?
Social history Smoking, sexual history.
Table 2.11 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask
Presenting symptoms Direct questions
Dysuria Pain: SOCRATES (p36). Fever? Sexual history.
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) Abnormal-looking urine? Previous problems.
Loin/scrotal pain Must rule out testicular torsion (p652).
Haematuria (p293 and p647)
Urethral/vaginal discharge (p413)
Sex problems; dyspareunia (OHCS
p310)
Menses (OHCS p250) Ask about menarche, menopause, length of
periods, amount, pain? Intermenstrual loss? 1st
day of last menstrual period (LMP)?
Dysuria
Be sure you mean the same as your patient and colleagues, as dysuria refers to
both painful micturition (‘uralgia') and diffi cult micturition (voiding diffi culty, p81).
Uralgia is typically from urethral, bladder, or vaginal infl ammation (UTI; perfumed
bath products, spermicides, urethral syndrome, p300). If post menopausal, look for a
urethral caruncle—fl eshy outgrowth of distal urethral mucosa, 1cm, typically origi-
nating from the posterior urethral lip. Also think of prostatitis, STI/urethritis (p413),
vaginitis, and vulvitis. Rare causes: Stones, urethral lesions (eg car cinoma, lympho-
ma, papilloma), post-partum complications (eg retained products of conception).
Voiding diffi culty is a sign of outfl ow obstruction, eg from an enlarged prostate,
or urethral stricture (commonly post-traumatic, post-gonococcal). Other features:
straining to void, poor stream, urinary retention, and incontinence. Strang ury is
urethral pain, usually referred from the bladder base, causing a constant distr es sing
desire to urinate even if there is little urine to void. Causes: Stones, catheters, cys-
titis, prostati tis, bladder neoplasia, rarely: bladder endometriosis, schistosomiasis.
Frequency
Aim to diff erentiate urine production (eg diabetes mellitus and insipidus, polydip-
sia, diuretics, alcohol, renal tubular disease, adrenal insuffi ciency) from frequent
passage of small amounts of urine (eg in cystitis, urethritis, neurogenic bladder),
or bladder com pression or outfl ow obstruction (pregnancy, bladder tumour, en-
larged prostate).
i = irritative (or ‘fi lling’) symptoms: they can be caused by, for example, UTI, as well as obstructions.

Oliguria/anuria
Oliguria is defi ned as a urine output of <400mL/24h or <0.5mL/kg/h and can be a sign
of shock (eg post-op, p576) or acute kidney injury: causes: p298. Anuria is defi ned as
<50mL/24h. In a catheterized patient with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage,
with slow decline of oliguria to anuria renal dysfunction is more likely.
Polyuria
Increased urine volume, eg >3L/24h. Causes: Over-enthusiastic IV fl uid therapy; diabe-
tes mellitus & insipidus (diabetes is Greek for fountain);Ca2+; psycho genic polydipsia/
PIP syndrome (p240); polyuric phase of recovering acute tubular necrosis.
Irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms
(See also p642.) Symptoms of prostate enlargement are miscalled ‘prosta tism’; it is
better to talk about irritative or obstructive bladder symptoms, as bladder neck
obstruction or a stricture may be the cause.
1 Irritative bladder symptoms: Urgency, dysuria, frequency, nocturia 6 (the last
two are also associated with causes of polyuria).
2 Obstructive symptoms: Reduced size and force of urinary stream, hesitancy and
interruption of stream during voiding and terminal dribbling—the usual cause is
enlargement of the prostate (prostatic hyperplasia), but other causes include
a urethral stricture, tumour, urethral valves, or bladder neck contracture. The
maximum fl ow rate of urine is normally ~18–30mL/s.
Terminal dribbling
Dribbling at the end of urination, often seen in conjunction with incontinence follow-
ing incomplete urination, associated with prostatism.
Urinary changes
Cloudy urine suggests pus (UTI) but is often normal phosphate precipitation in an
alkaline urine. Pneumaturia (bubbles in urine as it is passed). Occurs with UTI due to
gas-forming organisms or may signal an enterovesical (bowel–bladder) fi stula from
diverticulitis, Crohn’s disease or neoplastic disease of the bowel. Nocturia occurs
with ‘irritative bladder’, diabetes mellitus, UTI, and reversed diurnal rhythm (seen in
renal and cardiac failure). Haematuria (RBC in urine) is due to neoplasia or glomeru-
lonephritis (p310) until proven otherwise. Rule out UTI.
Voiding diffi culty
This includes poor fl ow, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittent stream, incontinence
(eg overfl ow), retention (acute or chronic), incomplete emptying (±UTI from residual
urine). Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with overfl ow. Causes:
Obstructive: prostatic hyperplasia, early oedema after bladder neck repair, uterine
prolapse, retroverted gravid uterus, fi broids, ovarian cysts, urethral foreign body,
ectopic ureterocele, bladder polyp, or cancer. Bladder overdistension—eg after epi-
dural for childbirth. Detrusor weakness or myopathy causes incomplete emptying
+ dribbling overfl ow incontinence (do cystometry/electro myography; causes include
neurological disease and interstitial cystitis (OHCS p306); it may lead to a contr acted
bladder, eg requiring substitution enterocystoplasty). Drugs: epidural anaesthesia;
tricyclics, anticholinergics. CNS: suprapontine (stroke); cord lesions (cord injury, mul-
tiple sclerosis); peripheral nerve (prolapsed disc, diabetic or other neuropathy); or
refl ex, due to pain (eg with herpes infections).
6 In the elderly, nocturia (1–2/night) may be ‘normal’ because of: i) loss of ability to concentrate urine; ii) pe-
ripheral oedema fl uid returns to the circulation at night; iii) circadian rhythms may be lost; iv) less sleep is
needed and waking may be interpreted as a need to void (a conditioned Pavlovian response).

See table 2.12 for direct questions to ask regarding presenting symptoms.
Table 2.12 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask
Presenting symptoms Direct questions
Breast lump Previous lumps? Family history? Pain? Nipple
discharge? Nipple inversion? Skin changes? Change
in size related to menstrual cycle? Number of
pregnancies? First/last/latest period? Postnatal?
Breast feeding? Drugs (eg HRT)? Consider metastatic
disease (weight loss, breathlessness, back pain,
abdominal mass?)
Breast pain SOCRATES (p36). Bilateral/unilateral? Rule out cardiac
(see BOX ‘Breast pain’) chest pain (p94 & p784). History of trauma? Any
mass? Related to menstrual cycle?
Nipple discharge Amount? Nature (colour? consistency? any blood?)
(see BOX ‘Nipple discharge’)
Past history Any previous lumps and/or malignancies. Previous mammograms,
clinical examinations of the breast, USS, fi ne-needle aspirate (FNA)/core biopsies.
Drug history Ask specifi cally about HRT and the Pill.
Family history See p520.
Social history Try to gain an impression of support network if suspect malignancy.
Breast pain
Is it premenstrual (cyclical mastalgia, OHCS p254)? Breast cancer (refer, eg, for
mammography if needed)? If non-malignant and non-cyclical, think of:
• Tietze’s syndrome (costochondritis plus swelling of the costal cartilage)
• Bornholm disease/Devil’s grip (Coxsackie B virus, causing chest and abdominal
pain, which may be mistaken for cardiac pain or an acute surgical abdomen. It
resolves within ~2 weeks)
• angina
• gallstones
• lung disease
• thoracic outlet syndrome
• oestrogens/HRT.
If none of the above, wearing a fi rm bra all day may help, as may NSAIDS.
Nipple discharge
Causes: Duct ectasia (green/brown/red, often multiple ducts and bilateral), intra-
ductal papilloma/adenoma/carcinoma (bloody discharge, often single duct), lacta-
tion. Management: Diagnose the cause (mammogram, ultrasound, ductogram);
then treat appropriately. Cessation of smoking reduces discharge from duct ecta-
sia. Microdochectomy/total duct excision can be considered if other measures fail,
though may give no improvement in symptoms.
With thanks to Dr Simon Vann Jones for his contribution to this page.

The breast: examination
1 Inspection Assess size and shape of any masses as well as overlying surface.
Which quadrant (see fi g 2.51)? Note skin involvement; ulceration, dimpling (peau
d’orange), and nipple inversion/discharge.
2 Palpation of the breast Confi rm size, and shape of any lump. Is it fi xed/teth-
ered to skin or underlying structures (see BOX 2 ‘Palpation’)? Is it fl uctuant/com-
pressible/hard? Temperature? Tender? Mobile (more likely to be fi broadenoma)?
3 Palpation of the axilla for lymph nodes Metastatic spread? Ipsilateral/bilat-
eral? Matted? Fixed?
4 Further examination Examine abdomen for hepatomegaly, spine for tender-
ness, lungs (metastatic spread).
1 General inspection
Always have a chaperone present when examining the breast.
Introduction, consent, position patient sitting at edge of bed with hands by her
side, expose to waist. Inspect both breasts for obvious masses, contour anomalies,
asymmetry, scars, ulceration, skin changes, eg peau d’orange (orange peel appear-
ance resulting from oedema). Look for nipple inversion and nipple discharge. Ask
her to ‘press hands on hips’ and then ‘hands on head’ to accentuate any asymmetri-
cal changes. While patient has her hands raised inspect axillae for any masses as
well as inspecting under the breasts.
2 Palpation of the breast
Position patient sitting back at 45° with hand
behind head (ie right hand behind head when
examining the right breast—see fi g 2.50). Ask
patient if she has any pain or discharge. Exam-
ine painful areas last and then ask her to ex-
press any discharge. Examine each breast with Fig 2.50 Correct patient position for

3 Palpation of the axilla
Examine both axillae. When examining right
axilla, hold the patient’s right arm with your
right hand and examine axilla with left hand.

The thyroid: examination
For symptoms of thyroid disease see p218 & p220. See also lumps in the neck, p598–
600.
1 Inspection The key questions to ask oneself when presented with a lump in the
neck are: Is this lump thyroid related or not? What is the patient’s thyroid sta-
tus? Inspect the neck; the normal thyroid is usually neither visible nor palpable. A
midline swelling should raise your suspicion of thyroid pathology. Look for scars
(eg collar incision from previous thyroid surgery). Examine the face for signs
of hypothyroidism (puffi ness, pallor, dry fl aky skin, xanthelasma, corneal arcus,
balding, loss of lateral third of eyebrow) as well as overall body habitus. Assess
the patient’s demeanour; do they appear anxious, nervous, agitated, fi dgety (hy-
perthyroid)? Or slow and lethargic (hypothyroid)?
2 Swallow test Only goitres (p600), thyroglossal cysts (p598) and in some cases
lymph nodes should move up on swallowing.
3 Tongue protrusion test A thyroglossal cyst will move up on tongue protrusion.
4 Palpation (By this stage of the examination if the evidence is in favour of the
lump not rising from the thyroid it is acceptable to examine the lump like any oth-
er (p594); assess site, size, shape, smoothness (consistency), surface (contour/
edge/colour), and surroundings, as well as transilluminance, fi xation/tetheri ng,
fl uctuance/compressibility, temperature, tenderness and whether it is pulsatile.)
If a thyroid mass is suspected, standing behind the patient provides an oppor-
tunity to check for any proptosis (hyperthyroidism). Proceed to palpate each
lobe, attempting to decide whether any lump is solitary or multiple, nodular
or smooth/diffuse as well as site, size, etc. Repeating the swallow test while
palpating allows you to confi rm the early fi nding, but also attempt to ‘get below
the lump’. If there is a distinct inferior border under which you can place your
hand with the entire lump above it then the goitre is unlikely to have retrosternal
extension. Examining for ‘spread’ to the lymph nodes is particularly important
if you suspect a thyroid malignancy (p600). Complete palpation by assessing if
the presence of the lump has caused the trachea to deviate from the midline.
5 Percussion A retrosternal goitre will produce a dull percussion note when the
sternum is percussed.
6 Auscultation A bruit in a smooth thyroid goitre is suggestive of Graves’ disease
(p218).
The next stages of the exam are to examine the systemic signs of thyroid status.
7 Hands Clubbing (‘thyroid acropachy’) is seen in Graves’ disease. Palmar erythe-
ma and a fi ne tremor are also signs of thyrotoxicosis. Assess temperature (warm
peripheries if hyperthyroid) and the radial pulse; tachycardia and atrial fi brilla-
tion are seen in hyperthyroidism, while bradycardia is seen in hypothyroidism.
8 Eyes The ‘normal’ upper eyelid should always cover the upper eye such that the
white sclera is not visible between the lid and the iris. In hyperthyroidism with
exophthalmus there is proptosis as well as lid retraction and ‘lid lag’ may also be
detected. If the patient reports double vision when eye movements are being
tested this indicates ophthalmoplegia of hyperthyroidism.
9 Asking the patient to stand allows you to assess whether there is any proximal
myopathy (hypothyroidism). Look for pretibial myxoedema (brown swelling of
the lower leg above the lateral malleoli in Graves’ disease). Finally, test the refl ex-
es; these will be slow relaxing in hypothyroidism and brisk in hyperthyroidism.
10 Thank the patient and consider whether the lump is a goitre, and if so whether it
is single/multiple, diff use/nodular, as well as the patient’s thyroid status. Decide
on a diagnosis (p600).

1 Inspection
Introduction, consent, position patient sitting on a chair (with space behind),
adequately expose neck. Inspect from front and sides for any obvious goitres or
swellings, scars, signs of hypo-/hyperthyroidism.
2 Swallow test
Standing in front of the patient ask them to ‘sip water…hold in your mouth…and
swallow’ to see if any midline swelling moves up on swallowing.
3 Tongue protrusion test
Ask patient to ‘stick out your tongue’. Does the lump move up? (Thyroglossal cyst.)
If evidence favours lump not arising
from thyroid, examine lump like any
other (p594)
4 Palpation
Stand behind the patient.
• Proptosis: (p219.) While standing behind the patient ask them to tilt their head
back slightly; this will give you a better view to assess any proptosis than when
assessing the other aspects of eye pathology from front on, as in 8)
• The thyroid gland: Ask the patient ‘any pain?’ Place middle 3 fi ngers of either
hand along midline below chin and ‘walk down’ to thyroid, 2 fi nger breadths be-
low the cricoid on both sides. Assess any enlargement/ nodules
• Swallow test: Repeat as before, now palpating; attempt to ‘get under’ the lump
• Lymph nodes: Examine lymph nodes of head and neck (p60). Stand in front of
the patient
• Trachea: Palpate for tracheal deviation from the midline.
5 Percussion
Percuss the sternum for dullness of retrosternal extension of a goitre.
6 Auscultation
Listen over the goitre for a bruit.
7 Hands
• Inspect: For thyroid acropachy (clubbing) and palmar erythema
• Temperature
• Pulse: Rate and rhythm
• Fine tremor: Ask patient to ‘hold hands out’, place sheet of paper over out-
stretched hands to help.
8 Eyes
• Exophthalmos: Inspect for lid retraction and proptosis (p219)
• Lid lag: Ask patient to ‘look down following fi nger’ as you move your fi nger from
a point above the eye to below
• Eye movements: Ask patient to follow your fi nger, keeping their head still, as you
make an ‘H’ shape. Any double vision?
9 Completion
Ask patient to stand up from the chair to assess for proximal myopathy, look for
pretibial myxoedema, test ankle refl exes (ask patient to face away from you with
knee resting on chair). Thank patient and wash hands.

Speech and higher mental function
Have mercy on those with dysphasia: it is one of the most debilitating neurological
conditions, and the more frustrating when cognitive function is intact.
Dysphasia Impairment of language caused by brain damage.
Assessment:
1 If speech is fl uent, grammatical, and meaningful, dysphasia is unlikely.
2 Comprehension: can the patient follow one-, two-, and several-step commands
(touch your ear, stand up, then close the door)?
3 Repetition: can the patient repeat a sentence? Eg British Constitution.
4 Naming: can they name common and uncommon things (eg parts of a watch)?
5 Reading and writing: normal? They are usually aff ected like speech in dysphasia.
If normal, the patient is unlikely to be aphasic—could they be mute?
Classifi cation:
• Broca’s (expressive) anterior dysphasia—non-fl uent speech produced with ef-
fort and frustration with malformed words, eg ‘spoot’ for ‘spoon’ (or ‘that thing’).
Reading and writing are impaired but comprehension is relatively intact. Patients
understand questions and attempt to convey meaningful answers. Site of lesion: in-
fero-lateral dominant frontal lobe (see BOX ‘Problems with classifying dysphasias’).
• Wernicke’s (receptive) posterior dysphasia—empty, fl uent speech, like talk-
ing ragtime with phonemic (‘fl ush’ for ‘brush’) and semantic (‘comb’ for ‘brush’)
paraphasias/neologisms (may be mistaken for psychotic speech). The patient is
oblivious of errors. Reading, writing, and comprehension are impaired (replies are
inappropriate). Site of lesion: posterior superior dominant temporal lobe.
• Conduction aphasia—(traffi c between Broca’s and Wernicke’s area is interrupt-
ed.) Repetition is impaired; comprehension and fl uency less so.
• Nominal dysphasia—naming is aff ected in all dysphasias, but in nominal dyspha-
sia, objects cannot be named but other aspects of speech are normal. This occurs
with posterior dominant temporoparietal lesions.
Mixed dysphasias are common. Discriminating features take time to emerge after
an acute brain injury. Speech therapy is important, but may not help.
Dysarthria Diffi culty with articulation due to incoordination or weakness of the
musculature of speech. Language is normal (see earlier in topic).
• Assessment: Ask to repeat ‘British Constitution’ or ‘baby hippopotamus’.
• Cerebellar disease: Ataxia speech muscles cause slurring (as if drunk) and speech
irregular in volume and staccato in quality.
• Extrapyramidal disease: Soft, indistinct, and monotonous speech.
• Pseudobulbar palsy: (p507) Spastic dysarthria (upper motor neuron). Speech is
slow, indistinct, nasal and eff ortful (‘hot potato’ voice from bilateral hemispheric
lesions, MND (p506), or severe MS).
• Bulbar palsy: Lower motor neuron (eg facial nerve palsy, Guillain–Barré, MND,
p506)—any associated palatal paralysis gives speech a nasal character.
Dysphonia Diffi culty with speech volume due to weakness of respiratory muscles
or vocal cords (myasthenia, p512; Guillain–Barré syndrome, p702). It may be precipi-
tated in myasthenia by asking the patient to count to 100. Parkinson’s gives a mixed
picture of dysarthria and dysphonia.
Dyspraxia Poor performance of complex movements despite ability to do each in-
dividual component. Test by asking the patient to copy unfamiliar hand positions, or
mime an object’s use, eg a comb. The term ‘dyspraxia’ is used in three other ways:
• Dressing dyspraxia: The patient is unsure of the orientation of clothes on his body.
Test by pulling one sleeve of a sweater inside out before asking the patient to put it
back on (mostly non-dominant hemisphere lesions).
• Constructional dyspraxia: Diffi culty in assembling objects or drawing, eg a fi ve-
pointed star (non-dominant hemisphere lesions, hepatic encephalopathy).
• Gait dyspraxia: More common in the elderly; seen with bilateral frontal lesions,
lesions in the posterior temporal region, and hydrocephalus.

Assessing higher mental function: a practical guide
Start by reassuring the patient ‘I know this may be diffi cult...’ and try to engage
in conversation; asking questions that need to phrase to answer (ie not just yes/
no). This tests fl uency and reception, understanding, and allows assessment of
articulation, eg ‘How did you travel here today?’, ‘I came by bus’. Then assess
dysphasia by asking: ‘What is this’ eg pen (tests for nominal dysphasia), repeat
‘British Constitution’ (tests for conduction dysphasia and dysarthria). Then ask
patient to follow one-, two-, and three-step commands ensuring these ‘cross the
midline’, eg make a fi st with your right hand then extend your right index fi nger
and touch your left ear.
Problems with classifying dysphasias
The classical model of language comprehension occurring in Wernicke’s area and
language expression in Broca’s area is too simple. Functional MRI studies show old
ideas that processing of abstract words is confi ned to the left hemisphere whereas
concrete words are processed on the right are too simplistic. 7 It may be better to
think of a mosaic of language centres in the brain with more or less specialized
functions. There is evidence that tool-naming is handled diff erently and in a diff erent
area to fruit-naming. There are also individual diff erences in the anatomy of these
mosaics. This is depressing for those who want a rigid classifi cation of aphasia,
but a source of hope to those who have had a stroke: recovery may be better than
neuroimaging leads us to believe.
Movement disorders
Symptoms of movement disorders
Athetosis is due to a lesion in the putamen, causing slow sinuous writhing move-
ments in the hands, which are present at rest. Pseudoathetosis refers to athetoid
movements in patients with severe proprioceptive loss.
Chorea means dance (hence ‘choreography’)—a fl ow of jerky movements, fl itting
from one limb to another (each seemingly a fragment of a normal movement).
Distinguish from athetosis/pseudoathetosis (above-mentioned), and hemiballis-
mus (p468). Causes: Basal ganglia lesion (stroke, Huntington’s, p702); streptococci
(Sydenham’s chorea; St Vitus’ dance, p142); SLE (p554); Wilson’s (p285); neonatal ker-
nicterus; polycythaemia (p366); neuroacanthocytosis (genetic, with acanthocytes in
peripheral blood, chorea, oro-facial dyskinesia, and axonal neuropathy); hyperthy-
roidism (p218); drugs (levodopa, oral contraceptives/HRT, chlorpromazine, cocaine—
‘crack dancing’). The early stages of chorea may be detected by feeling fl uctuations
in muscle tension while the patient grips your fi nger.
: Dopamine antagonists, eg tetrabenazine 12.5mg/12h (/24h if elderly) PO; increase,
eg to 25mg/8h PO; max 200mg/d.
Hemiballismus is uncontrolled unilateral fl ailing movements of proximal limb joints
caused by contralateral subthalamic lesions. See p468.
Cerebellar signs
Speech: Slurred/ataxic/staccato. Eye movements: Nystagmus. Tone and power:
Hypotonia and reduced power. Coordination: Finger-to-nose test; test for dysdiado-
chokinesis, p499. Gait: Broad based, patients fall to the side of the lesion. Romberg's
test: ask patient to stand with eyes closed. If he/she loses balance, the test is posi-
tive and a sign of posterior column disease. Cerebellar disease is Romberg negative.
(DASHING: Dysdiadochokinesis, Ataxia, Slurred speech, Hypotonia and reduced
power, Intention tremor, Nystagmus, broad based Gait.)
7 While abstract words activate a sub-region of the left inferior frontal gyrus more strongly than concrete
words, specifi c activity for concrete words can also be observed in the left basal temporal cortex.

Psychiatric assessment
Introduce yourself, ask a few factual questions (precise name, age, job, and who is at
home). These may help your patient to relax, but be careful that you do not touch on
a nerve, eg if job recently lost, marriage recently ended so living alone.
Presenting problem Ask for the main problems that have led to this consultation.
Sit back and listen. Don’t worry whether the information is in a convenient form
or not—this is an opportunity for the patient to come out with worries, ideas, and
preoccupations unsullied by your expectations. After >3–5min it is often good to aim
to have a list of all the problems (each sketched only briefl y). Read them back to the
patient and ask if there are any more. Then ask about:
History of presenting problem For each problem obtain details, both current state
and history of onset, precipitating factors, and eff ects on life.
Check of major psychiatric symptoms Check those that have not yet been cov-
ered: depression—low mood, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), thoughts of
worthlessness/hopelessness, sleep disturbance with early morning waking, loss of
weight and appetite. Ask specifi cally about suicidal thoughts and plans: ‘Have you
ever been so low that you thought of harming yourself?’, ‘What thoughts have you
had?’ Check for hypomanic and manic features which can be missed in a patient
presenting as depressed. Hallucinations (‘Have you ever heard voices or seen things
when there hasn’t been anyone or anything there?’) and delusions (‘Have you ever
had any thoughts or beliefs that have struck you afterwards as bizarre?’); anxiety
and avoidance behaviour (eg avoiding shopping because of anxiety or phobias); ob-
sessional thoughts and compulsive behaviour, eating disorders, alcohol (see p281
for alcohol screening tests) and other drugs.
Present circumstances Housing, fi nance, work, relationships, friends.
Family history Ask about health, personality, and occupation of parents and sib-
lings, and the family’s medical and psychiatric history.
Background history Try to understand the context of the presenting problem.
• Biography: Relationships with family and peers as a child; school and work record;
sexual relationships and current relationships; and family. Previous ways of dealing
with stress and whether there have been problems and symptoms similar to the
presenting ones.
• Premorbid personality: Mood, character, hobbies, attitudes, and beliefs.
Past medical and psychiatric history Establish any past or present co-morbidities.
Mental state examination This is the state now, at the time of interview.
Appearance: Clothing, glasses, headwear? Unkempt/normal/meticulous?
Observable behaviour: Eg excessive slowness, signs of anxiety, gesture, gaze or
avoiding gaze, tears, laughter, pauses (while listening to voices?), attitude (eg with-
drawn).
Mode of speech: Include the rate, eg retarded or gabbling (pressure of speech),
rhythm, and tone of speech.
Mood: Note thoughts about harming self or others. Gauge your own responses to
the patient. The laughter and grand ideas of manic patients are contagious, as to a
lesser extent is the expression of thoughts from a depressed person.
Thoughts: Content: eg about himself, his own body, about other people, and the
future, any suicidal ideation? Note abnormal beliefs (delusions), eg that thoughts are
overheard, and abnormal ideas (eg persecutory, grandiose). Form: fl ight of ideas?
Knight’s move thinking? (See BOX ‘Psychiatric symptoms’.)
Unusual experiences or hallucinations: Note modality, eg visual, auditory.
Cognition: Orientated in time, place, and person? Short-term memory: give a name
and address and test recall after 5min. Draw the face of a clock (requires good
frontal and parietal function). Long-term memory: current aff airs recall. Name of
current political leaders (p64). This tests many other CNS functions, not just memory.
Concentration: Months of the year backwards.
Insight: Does the patient think they are unwell? Do they think you can help?

Psychiatric symptoms
There are many diff erent ways to think about psychiatric symptoms. One simple
approach can be to consider negative and positive symptoms. Negative symp-
toms involve the absence of a behaviour, thought, feeling, or sensation (eg lack
of appetite, apathy, and blunted emotions in depression), whereas positive symp-
toms involve their presence when not normally expected (eg thought insertion,
ie ‘Someone is putting thoughts into my head’). Understanding the diff erence
between psychosis and neurosis is vital. Psychosis entails a thought disorder (eg
thought insertion, thought broadcasting) ± delusions (abnormal beliefs which are
held to despite all reasoning, and which run counter to the patient’s cultural back-
ground) and abnormal perceptions (eg hallucinations). Neurosis entails insight—if
there are intrusive ideas or odd experiential phenomena, the person knows that
they are false or illusory (and may be triggered by stress, etc.).
Disorders of thought include fl ight of ideas, in which the speech races through
themes, switching whimsically or through associations, eg ‘clang’ association:
‘Yesterday I went down to the local shop. I didn’t hop (clang), but I walked. Kan-
garoos hop, don’t they? My friend Joey wasn’t there, though…’. Knight’s move
is an unexpected change in the direction of speech or conversation (akin to the
lateral component of the move of the knight’s piece in chess) and neologism is
the formation of new words. They may be normal or indicate an organic brain
condition or a psychosis.
Many psychiatric symptoms in isolation, to a lesser degree of severity, or even in
a diff erent culture, may well be considered part of ‘normal’ behaviour. For exam-
ple, a vision from a religious fi gure may be considered normal, whereas one from
an alien may not. Consider your patient in their cultural and religious context.
As with so many aspects of medicine, in psychiatry there is a vast spectrum of
behaviour, thought, and perception, at least one extreme of which is considered to
be ‘abnormal’. It is in part our challenge to attempt to interpret these symptoms
with relevance, insight, and impartiality so that we may best benefi t our patients
and not form opinions that are set in stone. On acute medical wards psychiatric
symptoms are often due to stress, drug or alcohol withdrawal, U&E imbalance, or
medication. When in doubt, ask a psychiatrist to help.
Beware of simplistic formulations, eg If you talk to God, you are praying. If
God talks to you, you have schizophrenia (Dr Thomas Szasz). It is not the audi-
tory phenomenon that makes the diagnosis of psychosis: what matters is what the
patient believes about the phenomenon, and whether they are associated with a
thought disorder or a delusion.

Method and order for routine examination
1 Look at the patient. Healthy, unwell, ori n extremis? This vital skill improves with
practice. Beware those who are sicker than they look, eg cardiogenic shock;
cord compression; non-accidental injury.
2 Pulse, BP, RR, O2 sats, T°.
3 Examine nails, hands, conjunctivae (anaemia), and sclerae (jaundice). Consider:
Paget’s, acromegaly, endocrine disease (thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal hypo- or
hyper-function), body hair, abnormal pigmentation, skin.
4 Examine mouth and tongue (cyanosed; smooth; furred; beefy, eg rhomboid area
denuded of papillae by Candida, after prolonged steroid inhaler use).
5 Examine the neck from behind: lymph nodes, goitre.
6 Make sure the patient is at4 5° to begin CVS examination in the neck: JVP; feel for
character and volume of carotid pulse.
7 The praecordium. Look for abnormal pulsations. Feel the apex beat (character;
position). Any parasternal heave or thrill? Auscultate (bell and diaphragm) apex
in the left lateral position, then the other three areas (p39) and carotids. Sit the
patient forward: listen during expiration.
8 While sitting forward, look for sacral oedema.
9 Respiratory examination with the patient at 90°. Observe (and count) RR; note
posterior chest wall movement. Assess chest expansion, percuss and auscultate.
10 Sit the patient back. Feel the trachea. Inspect again. Assess expansion of the
anterior chest. Percuss and auscultate again.
11 Examine axillae and breasts, if indicated (chaperone for all intimate examina-
tions).
12 Lie patient fl at (1 pillow) to inspect, palpate, percuss, and auscultate abdomen.
13 Look at the legs: swellings, perfusion, pulses, or oedema? Pitting? What level?
14 CNS exam: Cranial nerves: pupil responses; fundi; visual fi elds; visual acuity. Con-
sider corneal refl exes. ‘Open your mouth; stick your tongue out; screw up your
eyes; show me your teeth; raise your eyebrows.’ Limbs (most signs are due to
central not peripheral nerve lesions): look for wasting and fasciculation. Test
tone in all limbs. ‘Hold your hands out with your palms towards the ceiling and
fi ngers wide. Now shut your eyes.’ Watch for pronator drift. ‘Keep your eyes shut
and touch your nose with each index fi nger.’ ‘Lift your leg straight in the air. Keep
it there. Put your heel on the opposite knee (eyes shut) and run it up your own
shin.’ You have now tested power, coordination, and joint position sense. Tuning
fork on toes and index fi ngers to assess vibration sense.
15 Examine gait and speech. Any abnormalities of higher mental function?
16 Consider rectal and vaginal examination (chaperone essential).
17 Examine the urine with dipstick if appropriate.
In general, go into detail where you fi nd (or suspect) something to be wrong.

Cardiovascula r health
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common cause of death worldwide.
Encouraging cardiovascular health is not only about preventing IHD: health entails
the ability to exercise, and enjoying vigorous activity (within reason!) is one of the
best ways of achieving health, not just because the heart likes it (BP,  ‘good’ high-
density lipoprotein (HDL))—it can prevent osteoporosis, improve glucose tolerance,
and augment immune function (eg in cancer and if HIV+ve). People who improve
and maintain their fi tness live longer: age-adjusted mortality from all causes
is reduced by >40%. Avoiding obesity helps too, but weight loss per se is only
useful in reducing cardiovascular risk and the risk of developing diabetes when
combined with regular exercise. Moderate alcohol drinking may also promote
cardiovascular health.
Hypertension is the chief risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, followed by
smoking. Giving up smoking, even after many years, does bring benefi t. Simple ad-
vice works. Most smokers want to give up. Just because smoking advice does not
always work, do not stop giving it. Ask about smoking in consultations—especially
those regarding smoking-related diseases.
• Ensure advice is congruent with the patient’s beliefs about smoking.
• Getting patients to enumerate the advantages of giving up  motivation.
• Invite the patient to choose a date (when there will be few stresses) on which he
or she will become a non-smoker.
• Suggest throwing away all accessories (cigarettes, pipes, ash trays, lighters,
matches) in advance; inform friends of the new change; practise saying ‘no’ to
their off ers of ‘just one little cigarette’.
• Nicotine gum, chewed intermittently to limit nicotine release: ≥ ten 2mg sticks
may be needed/day. Transdermal nicotine patches may be easier. A dose in-
crease at 1wk can help. Written advice off ers no added benefi t to advice from
nurses. Always off er follow-up.
• Varenicline is an oral selective nicotine receptor partial agonist. Start 1wk be-
fore target stop date and gradually increase the dose. SES: appetite change; dry
mouth; taste disturbance; headache; drowsiness; dizziness; sleep disorders; ab-
normal dreams; depression; suicidal thoughts; panic; dysarthria.
• Bupropion (=amfebutamone) is said to  quit rate to 30% at 1yr vs 16% with
patches and 15.6% for placebo (patches + bupropion: 35.5%): 1 consider if the
above fails. Warn of SES: seizures (risk <1:1000), insomnia, headache.
Lipids and diabetes (pp690, 206) are the other major modifi able risk factors. The
QRISK2 score (www.qrisk.org) is used in the UK to integrate a patient’s diff erent car-
diovascular risk factors in order to predict future cardiovascular health.2 It can be
used as part of a consultation on lifestyle factors to show patients that address-
ing certain risk factors (eg smoking, BP) will reduce their risk of MIs and strokes.
Apply preventive measures such as healthy eating (p244) early in life to maxim-
ize impact, when there are most years to save, and before bad habits get ingrained.
The randomized trial
Cardiovascular medicine has an unrivalled treasure house of randomized trials.
One of the chief pleasures of cardiovascular medicine lies in integrating these
with clinical reasoning in a humane way. After a cardiac event, a protocol may
‘mandate’ statins, aspirin, -blockers, ACE-i (p114), and a target BP and LDL choles-
terol that makes your patient feel dreadful. What to do? Inform, negotiate, and
compromise. Never reject your patient because of lack of compliance with your
over-exacting regime ns. Keep smiling, keep communicating, and keep up to date:
the latest data may show that your patient was right all along.3

Cardiovascular symptoms
Chest pain Cardiac-sounding chest pain may have no serious cause, but always
think ‘Could this be a myocardial infarction (MI), dissecting aortic aneurysm, pericar-
ditis, or pulmonary embolism?’.
Character: Constricting suggests angina, oesophageal spasm, or anxiety; a sharp
pain may be from the pleura, pericardium, or chest wall. A prolonged (>½h), dull,
central crushing pain or pressure suggests MI.
Radiation: To shoulder, either or both arms, or neck/jaw suggests cardiac ischae-
mia. The pain of aortic dissection (p654) is classically instantaneous, tearing, and
interscapular, but may be retrosternal. Epigastric pain may be cardiac.
Precipitants: Pain associated with cold, exercise, palpitations, or emotion suggests
cardiac pain or anxiety; if brought on by food, lying fl at, hot drinks, or alcohol, con-
sider oesophageal spasm/disease (but meals can also cause angina).
Relieving factors: If pain is relieved within minutes by rest or glyceryl trinitrate
(GTN), suspect angina (GTN relieves oesophageal spasm more slowly). If antacids help,
suspect GI causes. Pericarditic pain improves on leaning forward.
Associations: Dyspnoea occurs with cardiac pain, pulmonary emboli, pleurisy, or
anxiety. MI may cause nausea, vomiting, or sweating. Angina is caused by coronary
artery disease—and also by aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomy opathy (HCM),
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)—and can be exacerbated by anae-
mia. Chest pain with tenderness suggests self-limiting Tietze’s syndrome. 1 Odd neu-
rological symptoms and atypical chest pain—think aortic dissection.
Pleuritic pain: Pain exacerbated by inspiration. Implies infl ammation of the pleura
from pulmonary infection, infl ammation, or infarction. It causes us to ‘catch our
breath’. : musculoskeletal pain;1 fractured rib (pain on respiration, exacerbated
by gentle pressure on the sternum); subdiaphragmatic pathology (eg gallstones).
Chest pain & acutely unwell (see p784) • Admit • Check pulse, BP in both arms
(unequal in aortic dissection p654), JVP, heart sounds; examine legs for DVT • Give O2
• IV line • Relieve pain (eg 5–10mg IV morphine) • Cardiac monitor • 12-lead ECG • CXR
• Arterial blood gas (ABG) Famous traps: Aortic dissection; zoster (p404); ruptured
oesophagus; cardiac tamponade (p154); opiate addiction.
Dyspnoea May be from LVF, PE, any respiratory cause, anaemia, pain, or anxiety.
Severity: Emergency presentations: p782. Ask about shortness of breath at rest,
on exertion, and on lying fl at; has their exercise tolerance changed? Associations:
Specifi c symptoms associated with heart failure are orthopnoea (ask about number
of pillows used at night), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (waking up at night gasp-
ing for breath, p49), and peripheral oedema. Pulmonary embolism is associated with
acute onset of dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain; ask about risk factors for DVT.
Palpitation(s) May be due to ectopics, sinus tachycardia, AF, SVT, VT, thyrotoxicosis,
anxiety, and rarely phaeochromocytoma. See p36. History: Characterize: do they
mean their heart was beating fast, hard, or irregularly? Ask about previous episodes,
precipitating/relieving factors, duration of symptoms, associated chest pain, dysp-
noea, dizziness, or collapse. Did the patient check their pulse?
Syncope May refl ect cardiac or CNS events. Vasovagal ‘faints’ are common (pulse,
pupils dilated). The history from an observer is invaluable in diagnosis. Prodromal
symptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnoea point to a cardiac cause, eg ar-
rhythmia. Aura, headache, dysarthria, and limb weakness indicate CNS causes.
During the episode: Was there a pulse? Limb jerking, tongue biting, or urinary incon-
tinence? NB: hypoxia from lack of cerebral perfusion may cause seizures. Recovery:
Was this rapid (arrhythmia) or prolonged, with drowsiness (seizure)?
1 25% of non-cardiac chest pain is musculoskeletal: look for pain on specifi c postures or activity. Aim to
reproduce the pain by movement and, sometimes, palpation over the structure causing it. Focal inje ction of
local anaesthetic helps diagnostically and is therapeutic. Tietze’s syndrome: self-limiting costochond ritis
± costosternal joint swelling. Causes: idiopathic; microtrauma; infection; psori atic/rheumatoid arthritis. :
NSAIDS or steroid injections. Tenderness is also caused by: fi brositis, lymph oma, chondrosarcoma, myeloma,
metastases, rib TB. Imaging: bone scintigraphy; CT.

Chest pain from the patient’s perspective
On acute wards we are always hearing questions such as ‘Is your pain sharp or
dull?’, followed by an equivocal answer. The doctor goes on: ‘Sharp like a knife—or
dull and crushing?’ The doctor is getting irritated because the patient must know
the answer but is not saying it. A true story paves the way to being less inquisito-
rial and having a more creative understanding of the nature of symptoms.
A patient came to a previous OHCM author saying ‘Last night I dreamed I had a
pain in my chest. Now I’ve woken up, and I’m not sure—have I got chest pain,
doctor? What do you think?’ How odd it is to be asked to examine a patient to
exclude a symptom, not a disease. (It turned out that she did have serious chest
pathology.) Odd, until one realizes that symptoms are often half-formed, and it
is our role to give them a local habitation and a name. Dialogue can transform a
symptom from ‘airy nothingness’ to a fact. 2
Patients often avoid using the word ‘pain’ to describe ischaemia: ‘wind’, ‘tighten-
ing’, ‘pressure’, ‘burning’, or ‘a lump in the throat’ (angina means to choke) may
be used. They may say ‘sharp’ to communicate severity, and not character. So be
as vague in your questioning as your patient is in their answers. ‘Tell me some
more about what you are feeling (long pause) … as if someone was doing what to
you?’ ‘Sitting on me’ or ‘like a hotness’ might be the response (suggesting cardiac
ischaemia). Do not ask ‘Does it go into your left arm’. Try ‘Is there anything else
about it?’ (pause) … ‘Does it go anywhere?’ Note down your patient’s exact words.
A good history, taking account of these features, is the best way to stratify pa-
tients likely to have cardiac pain. If the history is non-specifi c, there are no risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular diseases, and ECG and plasma troponin T (p118) are normal
6–12h after the onset of pain, discharge will probably be OK. 4 When in doubt, get
help. Features making cardiac pain unlikely:
• Stabbing, shooting pain.
• Pain lasting <30s, however intense.
• Well-localized, left sub-mammary pain (‘In my heart, doctor’).
• Pains of continually varying location.
• Youth.
Do not feel that you must diagnose every pain. Chest pain with no cause is com-
mon, even after extensive tests. Some patients have a ‘chronic pain syndrome’
similar to post-herpetic neuralgia. Typically, this responds to a tricyclic, eg low-
dose amitriptyline at night (this dose does not imply any depression).
Avoid being that doctor who triumphantly tells a patient that they are fi ne and
can go home, only to be met by a glare, as the disabling pain the patient presented
with is no better than when they arrived. Take time to explain why you do not
believe the pain is a result of dangerous pathology; to give advice on pain control
and ‘red fl ags’; and to reassure the patient that their problem is likely to resolve
with time.
2 Dialogue-transformed symptoms explain one of the junior doctor’s main vexations: when patients retell
symptoms to a consultant in the light of day, they bear no resemblance to what you originally heard. But do
not be vexed: your dialogue may have helped the patient far more than any ward round.

ECG—a methodical approach
Reading an ECG
First confi rm the patient’s name and age, and the ECG date. Then (see fi g 3.3):
• Rate: At usual speed (25mm/s) each ‘big square’ is 0.2s; each ‘small square’ is 0.04s.
To calculate the rate, divide 300 by the number of big squares between two con-
secutive R waves (table 3.1). The normal rate is 60–100bpm.
• Rhythm: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the ‘card method’: lay a card along
the ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card to and fro to
check that all intervals are equal. If they are not, note if:
• there is slight but regular lengthening and then shortening (with respiration)—
sinus arrhythmia, common in the young
• there are diff erent rates which are multiples of each other—varying block
• it is 100% irregular—atrial fi brillation (AF) or ventricular fi brill ation (VF).
Sinus rhythm is characterized by a P wave followed by a QRS complex. AF has no dis-
cernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular. Atrial fl utter (p130, fi g
3.35 p131) has a ‘sawtooth’ baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular
QRS complexes. Ventricular rhythm has QRS complexes >0.12s with P waves follow-
ing them or absent (fi g 3.12, p106).
• Axis: The overall direction of depolarization across the patient’s anterior chest; this
is the sum of all the ventricular electrical forces during ventricular depolarization.
See BOX ‘Determining the ECG axis’. Left axis deviation can result from left anterior
hemiblock, inferior MI, VT from a left ventricular focus, WPW, LVH. Right axis devia-
tion can result from RVH, PE, anterolateral MI, WPW and left posterior hemiblock.
• P wave: Normally precedes each QRS complex, and upright in II, III, & aVF but invert-
ed in aVR. Absent P wave: AF, P hidden due to junctional or ventricular rhythm. P mi-
trale: bifi d P wave, indicates left atrial hypertrophy. P pulmonale: peaked P wave,
indicates right atrial hypert rophy. Pseudo-P-pulmonale seen if K+.
• PR interval: Measure from start of P wave to start of QRS. Normal range: 0.12–0.2s
(3–5 small squares). A prolonged PR interval implies delayed AV conduction (1st
degree heart block). A short PR interval implies unusually fast AV conduction down
an accessory pathway, eg WPW (see fi g 3.37, p133). See heart block, p98.

S S Q S Q QS
Fig 3.2 ‘QRS’ complexes. If the fi rst defl ection from the isoelectric line is negative, it is a Q wave.
Any positive defl ection is an R wave. Any negative defl ection after an R is an S.
• QRS complex: See fi g 3.2. Normal duration: <0.12s. QRS >0.12s suggests ventricular
conduction defects, eg a bundle branch block (pp99, 100), metabolic disturbance, or
ventricular origin (eg ventricular ectopic). High-amplitude QRS complexes suggest
ventricular hypertrophy (p100). Normal Q waves are <0.04s wide and <2mm deep;
they are often seen in leads I , aVL , V5, and V6 and refl ect normal septal depolariza-
tion. Pathological Q waves (deep and wide) may occur within a few hours of an
acute MI.
• QT interval: Measure from start of QRS to end of T wave. It varies with rate. The
corrected QT interval (QTc) is the QT interval divided by the square root of the R–R
interval, ie QTc=QT/√RR. Normal QTc: 0.38–0.42s. For causes of prolonged QT interval
see p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death.
• ST segment: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usu-
ally implies infarction (p119, fi gs 3.9, 3.10, pp103–4) or ischaemia, respectively.
• T wave: Normally inverted in aVR, V1, and occasionally V2. Normal if inverted in isola-
tion in lead III. Abnormal if inverted in I, II, and V4–V6. Peaked in hyperkalaemia (fi g
14.4, p675) and fl attened in hypokalaemia.
• J wave: See p849. The J point is where the S wave fi nishes and ST segment starts. A
J wave is a notch at this point. Seen in hypothermia, SAH, and Ca2+.

Calculating the heart rate
Divide 300 by the number of big squares per R–R interval (assumes the UK standard
ECG speed of 25mm/s, elsewhere 50mm/s may be used: don’t be confused!).

0.6 3 100
1.0 5 60
1.4 7 43
Determining the ECG axis
Each ‘lead’ on the 12-lead ECG represents electrical activity along a particular plane
(see fi g 3.4).
The axis lies at 90° to the di-
rection of the lead in which
the isoelectric (equally +ve
and Ωve) QRS complex is
found. For example, if the
QRS is isoelectric in lead II
(+60°), the axis is either:
+60° Ω 90° = Ω30°, or
+60° + 90° = +150°.
If the QRS is more positive
than negative in lead I (0°) Fig 3.4 The planes represented by the limb ‘leads’.
then the axis must be Ω30°,
and vice versa.
In practice, the exact axis matters little; what you need to be able to recognize is
whether the axis is normal (Ω30° to +90°), left-deviated (<Ω30°), or right deviated
(>+90°). There are many ways of doing this. If the QRS in lead I (0°) is predomi-
nantly positive (the R wave is taller than the S wave is deep), the axis must be be-
tween Ω90° and +90°. If lead II (+60°) is mostly positive, the axis must be between
Ω30° and +150°. So if both I and II are positive, the axis must be between Ω30° and
+90°—the normal range. When II is negative, the axis is likely to be left-deviated
(<Ω30°) and when I is negative, the axis is likely to be right-deviated (>+90°). One
way of remembering this is:
Lovers Leaving—Left axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and II point away
from each other.
Lovers Returning—Right axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and III ± II
point towards each other (fi g 3.11).

ECG—abnormalities
Sinus tachycardia All impulses are initiated in the sinoatrial node (‘sinus rhythm’)
hence all QRSS are preceeded by a normal P wave with a normal PR interval. Tachycar-
dia means rate >100bpm. See p127.
Sinus bradycardia Sinus rhythm at a rate <60bpm. Causes: Physical fi tness, vas-
ovagal attacks, sick sinus syndrome, drugs (-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone), hypo-
thyroidism, hypothermia, intracranial pressure, cholestasis. See p122.
AF (ECG p125) Common causes: IHD, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, obesity, heart fail-
ure, alcohol. See p130.
Heart block (HB) (See fi g 3.5.) Disrupted passage of electrical impulse through the
AV node.
1st-degree HB: The PR interval is prolonged and unchanging; no missed beats.
2nd-degree HB: Mobitz I: The PR interval becomes longer and longer until a QRS is
missed, the pattern then resets. This is Wenckebach phenomenon.
2nd-degree HB: Mobitz II: QRSs are regularly missed. eg P - QRS - P - - P - QRS - P - - this
would be Mobitz II with 2:1 block (2P:1QRS). This is a dangerous rhythm as it may
progress to complete heart block.
1st- and 2nd-degree HB may be caused by: normal variant, athletes, sick sinus syn-
drome, IHD (esp inferior MI), acute myocarditis, drugs (digoxin, -blockers).
3rd-degree HB: Complete heart block: No impulses are passed from atria to ventri-
cles so P waves and QRSS appear independently of each other. As tissue distal to the
AVN paces slowly, the patient becomes very bradycardic, and may develop haemo-
dynamic compromise. Urgent treatment is required. Causes: IHD (esp inferior MI),
idiopathic (fi brosis), congenital, aortic valve calcifi ca tion, cardiac surgery/trauma,
digoxin toxicity, infi ltration (abscesses, granulomas, tumours, parasites).
ST elevation Normal variant (high take-off ), acute MI (STEMI), Prinzmetal’s angina
(p708), acute pericarditis (saddle-shaped), left ventricular aneurysm.
ST depression Normal variant (upward sloping), digoxin toxicity (downward sloping),
ischaemic (horizontal): angina, NSTEMI, acute posterior MI (ST depression in V1–V3).
T inversion In V1–V3: normal (black patients and children), right bundle branch block
(RBBB), RV strain (eg secondary to PE). In V2–V5: anterior ischaemia, HCM, subarachnoid
haemorrhage, lithium. In V4–V6 and aVL: lateral ischaemia, LVH, left bundle branch
block (LBBB). In II, III and aVF: inferior ischaemia.
NB: ST- and T-wave changes are often non-specifi c, and must be interpreted in the
light of the clinical context.
Myocardial infarction (See p118 and fi g 3.21; example ECGs fi gs 3.9, 3.10)
• Within hours, the T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise.
• Within 24h, the T wave inverts. ST elevation rarely persists, unless a left ventricular
aneurysm develops. T-wave inversion may or may not persist.
• Within a few days, pathological Q waves begin to form. Q waves usually persist, but
may resolve in 10% of patients.
• The location of these changes indicates the ischaemic area location, see table 3.2.
Pulmonary embolism (fi g 3.11) ECG fi ndings may include: sinus tachycardia (com-
monest), RBBB (p100), right ventricular strain pattern (R-axis deviation, dominant R
wave and T-wave inversion/ST depression in V1 and V2,). Rarely, the ‘SIQIIITIII’ pattern
occurs: deep S waves in I, pathological Q waves in III, inverted T waves in III.
Metabolic abnormalities Digoxin effect: Down-sloping ST depression and inverted
T wave in V5–V6 (‘reversed tick’, see fi g 3.19). In digoxin toxicity, any arrhythmia may
occur (ventricular ectopics and nodal bradycardia are common). Hyperkalaemia:
Tall, tented T wave, widened QRS, absent P waves, ‘sine wave’ appearance (see fi g 14.4,
p675). Hypokal aemia: Small T waves, prominent U waves, peaked P waves. Hypercal-
caemia: Short QT interval. Hypocalcaemia: Long QT interval, small T waves. See p711
for causes of long QT intervals.

Location, location, location
When considering rate and rhythm, your fi ndings should be the same in all leads,
albeit clearer in some than others. Other ECG features may vary lead by lead, both
in terms of what is ‘normal’ and in what a change indicates. For example, ST eleva-
tion in leads II, III, and aVF suggests an inferior MI requiring immediate treatment,
likely PCI to the right coronary artery, see table 3.2. ST elevation across all leads,
however, suggests instead pericarditis which necessitates entirely diff erent man-
agement (p154). An R wave taller than the S is deep (R dominance) is normal in V5
and V6 but may suggest right ventricular strain or posterior MI if seen in V1 and V2.

Circumfl ex in 20%: ‘left dominant’
V7–9 Posterior Circumfl ex
Following a posterior MI, the standard 12-lead ECG will not show Q waves, ST
elevation or hyperacute T waves. Instead, you may fi nd these changes but
‘upside-down’ in V1–V3: prominent R waves, fl at ST depression, and T-wave inver-
sion. If you record V7–V9 leads, you may fi nd the classic ST elevation pattern and
so confi rm posterior MI. See fi g 3.24.
The ‘upside-down’ changes seen in posterior MI are called ‘reciprocal changes’:
changes that appear when ‘looking’ at ischaemic myocardium from the other side
of the heart. These can arise with MIs in other locations (fi g 3.9). They are particu-
larly important in posterior MI as they may be the only changes on the 12-lead ECG.

V1 : Right sternal edge, 4th intercostal space.
V2 : Left sternal edge, 4th intercostal space.
V3 : Half-way between V2 and V4.
V4 : 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line; all
subsequent leads are in the same horizontal
plane as V4.
V5 : Anterior axillary line.
V6 : Mid-axillary line (V7: posterior axillary line).
Good skin preparation (clean with non-alcoholic
wipe, shave if hairy, etc.) will improve ECG qual-
ity. Finish 12-lead ECGs with a long rhythm strip
in lead II.
QRS complexes: the long and the short

tion, and width represents time, so a broader QRS Fig 3.6 Placement of ECG leads.
complex means depolarization of the ventricles is
taking longer. Normally, a wave of depolarization reaches the ventricles via the spe-
cialist conduction pathways—the bundles of His. This delivers the electrical activity
to certain points of the ventricles, meaning the waves of depolarization need travel
as short a distance as possible to depolarize all the ventricular myocardium. This al-
lows rapid spread of depolarization and thus an effi cient contraction action as both
ventricles contract from apex to outfl ow tracts together. Hence, the QRS complex is
narrow (<120ms).
Ventricular depolarization takes longer when depolarization is not initiated in this
pattern. For example, if it originates in the ventricles (eg ventricular ectopics, VT)
or if one or more branches of the bundles of His are blocked—bundle branch blocks
—meaning depolarization is initiated in one ventricle but not the other, so it has to
travel the long (in time and space) path from one ventricle to the other.
Ventricular depolarization also takes longer if all conduction is slowed. This may
happen in some electrolyte imbalances, eg hyperkalaemia.
Right bundle branch block: (p102, fi g 3.8) QRS >0.12s, ‘RSR’ pattern in V1; dominant R in
V1; inverted T waves in V1–V3 or V4; wide, slurred S wave in V6. Causes: normal variant
(isolated RBBB), pulmonary embolism, cor pulmonale.
Left bundle branch block: (p101, fi g 3.7) QRS >0.12s, ‘M’ pattern in V5, dominant S in
V1, inverted T waves in I, aVL, V5–V6. Causes: IHD, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, idi-
opathic fi brosis. NB: if there is LBBB, no comment can be made on the ST segment or
T wave. New LBBB may represent a STEMI, see p798.
Bifascicular block: The combination of RBBB and left bundle hemiblock, manifest as
an axis deviation, eg left axis deviation in the case of left anterior hemiblock.
Trifascicular block: Bifascicular block plus 1st-degree HB. May need pacing (p132).
Suspect left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if the R wave in V6 is >25mm or the sum
of the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V6 is >35mm (see fi g 3.41).
Suspect right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) if dominant R wave in V1, T wave inver-
sion in V1–V3 or V4, deep S wave in V6, right axis deviation.
Other causes of dominant R wave in V1: RBBB, posterior MI, type A WPW syndrome
(p133).
Causes of low-voltage QRS complex: (QRS <5mm in all limb leads.) Hypothyroid-
ism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), haematocrit (intracardiac blood
resistivity is related to haematocrit), changes in chest wall impedance (eg in renal
failure & subcutaneous emphysema but not obesity), pulmonary embolism, bundle
branch block, carcinoid heart disease, myocarditis, cardiac amyloid, doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity, and other heart muscle diseases, pericardial eff usion, pericarditis. 5

Cardiac imaging
There are many heart conditions associated with structural defects, eg valve defects,
congenital heart diseases, and some muscle disorders (eg hypertrophic cardiomyo-
pathy (HCM)). Whilst clues to these can sometimes be found on history, examination,
and ECG, it is imaging that gives the diagnosis. Imaging is also helpful for conditions
that are not primarily due to deformities but which aff ect the way the heart func-
tions. For example, after an MI the aff ected territory may be hypokinetic. Stress
techniques allow us to observe the heart at rest and then under stress, comparing
the perfusion and function in the two states. Cardiac MRI is a rapidly expanding area
although not yet available in all major hospitals.
Chest X-ray The humble chest X-ray provides just a snapshot of the heart and little
detail but can be an important source of information and is often the only immedi-
ately accessible imaging modality for a new or newly unwell patient. An enlarged
heart (cardiothoracic ratio >0.5) suggests congestive heart failure; signs of pulmo-
nary oedema suggest decompensated heart failure (see fi g 3.38); a globular heart
may indicate pericardial eff usion (fi g 3.14); metal wires and valves will show up,
evidencing previous cardiothoracic surgery; dextrocardia may explain a bizarre ECG;
and rib notching may be an important clue in coarctation of the aorta (p156).
Echocardiography This is the workhorse of cardiological imaging. Ultrasound is
used to give real-time images of the moving heart. This can be transthoracic (TTE)
or transoesophageal (TOE), at rest, during exercise, or after infusion of a pharmaco-
logical stressor (eg dobutamine). If the patient is too unwell to be moved, an echo
machine can be brought to them and continuous TOE imaging may be used as a guide
during surgery. Increasingly pocket-sized echo machines are used for a quick assess-
ment of an unwell patient, to be followed by a formal scan later. See p110.
Cardiac CT This can provide detailed information about cardiac structure and func-
tion. CT angiography (fi g 3.15) permits contrast-enhanced imaging of coronary ar-
teries during a single breath hold with very low radiation doses. It can diagnose
signifi cant (>50%) stenosis in coronary artery disease with an accuracy of 89%.
CT coronary angiography has a negative predictive value of >99%, which makes it
an eff ective non-invasive alternative to routine transcatheter coronary angiography
to rule out coronary artery disease.6 Medications are often given to slow the heart
down and the imaging may be ‘gated’, meaning the scanner is programmed to take
images at times corresponding to certain points on the patient’s ECG. This allows
characterization of the heart at diff erent points in the cardiac cycle. See p740.
Cardiac MR A radiation-free method of characterizing cardiac structure and func-
tion including viability of myocardium. By varying the settings, diff erent defects can
be found. MR is the fi rst-choice imaging method to look at diseases that directly af-
fect the myocardium (fi g 3.16). Nowadays, pacemakers are available which are safe
for MR scanning—check MR safety with your cardiac technicians before requesting
MR for patients with pacemakers in situ. See p740.
Nuclear imaging Perfusion is assessed at rest and with exercise- or pharmacolog-
ically-induced stress. This test is particularly useful for assessing whether myocar-
dium distal to a blockage is viable and so whether stenting or CABG will be of value.
If hypoperfusion is ‘fi xed’, ie present at rest and under stress, the hypoperfused area
is probably scar tissue and so non-viable. If hypoperfusion is ‘reversible’ at rest, the
myocardium may benefi t from improved blood supply. See p741.

Echocardiography
This non-invasive technique uses the diff ering ability of various structures within
the heart to refl ect ultrasound waves. It not only demonstrates anatomy but also
provides a continuous display of the functioning heart throughout its cycle.
Types of scan
M-mode (motion mode): A single-dimension image.
Two-dimensional (real time): A 2D, fan-shaped image of a segment of the heart is
produced on the screen (fi g 3.17); the moving image may be ‘frozen’. Several views
are possible, including long axis, short axis, 4-chamber, and subcostal. 2D echocar-
diography is good for visualizing conditions such as: congenital heart disease, LV
aneurysm, mural thrombus, LA myxoma, septal defects.
3D echocardiography: Now possible with matrix array probes, and is termed 4D (3D +
time) if the images are moving.
Doppler and colour-fl ow echocardiography: Diff erent coloured jets illustrate fl ow
and gradients across valves and septal defects (p156) (Doppler eff ect, p736).
Tissue Doppler imaging: This employs Doppler ultrasound to measure the velocity
of myocardial segments over the cardiac cycle. It is particularly useful for assessing
longitudinal motion—and hence long-axis ventricular function, which is a sensitive
marker of systolic and diastolic heart failure.
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE): More sensitive than transthoracic echo-
cardiography (TTE) as the transducer is nearer to the heart. Indications: diagnosing
aortic dissections; assessing prosthetic valves; fi nding cardiac source of emboli, and
IE/SBE. Contraindicated in oesophageal disease and cervical spine instability.
Stress echocardiography: Used to evaluate ventricular function, ejection fraction,
myocardial thickening, regional wall motion pre- and post-exercise, and to charac-
terize valvular lesions. Dobutamine or dipyridamole may be used if the patient can-
not exercise. Inexpensive and as sensitive/specifi c as a thallium scan (p741).
Uses of echocardiography
Quantifi cation of global LV function: Heart failure may be due to systolic or diastol-
ic ventricular impairment (or both). Echo helps by measuring end-diastolic volume. If
this is large, systolic dysfunction is the likely cause. If small, diastolic. Pure forms of
diastolic dysfunction are rare. Diff erentiation is important because vasodilators are
less useful in diastolic dysfunction as a high ventricular fi lling pressure is required.
Echo is also useful for detecting focal and global hypokinesia, LV aneurysm, mural
thrombus, and LVH (echo is 5–10 times more sensitive than ECG in detecting this).
Estimating right heart haemodynamics: Doppler studies of pulmonary artery fl ow
and tricuspid regurgitation allow evaluation of RV function and pressures.
Valve disease: The technique of choice for measuring pressure gradients and valve
orifi ce areas in stenotic lesions. Detecting valvular regurgitation and estimating its
signifi cance is less accurate. Evaluating function of prosthetic valves is another role.
Congenital heart disease: Establishing the presence of lesions, and signifi cance.
Endocarditis: Vegetations may not be seen if <2mm in size. TTE with colour Doppler
is best for aortic regurgitation (AR). TOE is useful for visualizing mitral valve vegeta-
tions, leafl et perforation, or looking for an aortic root abscess.
Pericardial effusion: Best diagnosed by echo. Fluid may fi rst accumulate between
the posterior pericardium and the left ventricle, then anterior to both ventricles and
anterior and lateral to the right atrium. There may be paradoxical septal motion.
HCM: (p152) Echo features include asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, small LV cavity,
dilated left atrium, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.

Cardiac catheterization
This involves the insertion of a catheter into the heart via the femoral or radial artery
or venous system, and manipulating it within the heart and great vessels to:
• Inject radiopaque contrast medium to image cardiac anatomy and blood fl ow, see
fi g 3.18a.
• Perform angioplasty (ballooning and stenting), valvuloplasty (eg transcatheter
aortic valve implantation (TAVI, fi g 3.45)), cardiac biopsies, transcatheter septal
defect closure.
• Perform electrophysiology studies and radiofrequency ablations.
• Sample blood to assess oxygen saturation and measure pressures.
• Perform intravascular ultrasound or echocardiography.
During the procedure, ECG and arterial pressures are monitored continuously. In the
UK, the majority are performed as day-case procedures.
Indications
• Coronary artery disease: diagnostic (assessment of coronary vessels and graft pa-
tency); therapeutic (angioplasty, stent insertion), fi g 3.18b.
• Valvular disease: diagnostic (pressures indicate severity); therapeutic valvuloplas-
ty (if the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery).
• Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by meas-
uring pressures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy).
• Other: cardiomyopathy; pericardial disease; endomyocardial biopsy.
Pre-procedure checks
• Brief history/examination; NB: peripheral pulses, bruits, aneurysms.
• Investigations: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting screen, CXR, ECG.
• Consent for procedure, including possible extra procedures, eg consent for angio-
plasty if planning to do angiography as you may fi nd a lesion that needs stenting.
Explain reason for procedure and possible complications.
• IV access, ideally in the left hand.
• Patient should be nil by mouth (NBM) from 6h before the procedure.
• Patients should take all their morning drugs (and pre-medication if needed)—but
withhold oral hypoglycaemics.
Post-procedure checks
• Pulse, BP, arterial puncture site (for bruising or swelling), foot pulses.
• Investigations: FBC and clotting (if suspected blood loss), ECG.
Complications
• Haemorrhage: apply fi rm pressure over puncture site. If you suspect a false aneu-
rysm, ultrasound the swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high
risk for infections.
• Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contrast agents.
• Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due to dissection, thrombosis, or arterial spasm.
Occurs in <1% of brachial catheterizations. Rare with femoral catheterization.
• Angina: may occur during or after cardiac catheterization. Usually responds to
sublingual GTN; if not, give analgesia and IV nitrates.
• Arrhythmias: usually transient. Manage along standard lines.
• Pericardial eff usion: suspect if unexplained continued chest pain. May need drain
depending on severity and haemodynamic status.
• Pericardial tamponade: rare, but should be suspected if the patient becomes hypo-
tensive and anuric.  Urgent pericardial drain.
• Infection: post-catheter pyrexia is usually due to a contrast reaction. If it persists
for >24h, take blood cultures before giving antibiotics.
Mortality <1 in 1000 patients, in most centres.
Intracardiac electrophysiology This catheter technique can determine types and
origins of arrhythmias, and locate and ablate problem areas, eg aberrant pathways
in WPW or arrhythmogenic foci. Arrhythmias may be induced, and the eff ectiveness
of control by drugs assessed.

Cardiovascular drugs
Antiplatelet drugs Aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclo-oxygenase, preventing pro-
duction of thromboxane A2, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Used in low dose
(eg 75mg/24h PO) for secondary prevention following MI, TIA/stroke, and for patients
with angina or peripheral vascular disease. May have a role in primary prevention.7
ADP receptor antagonists (eg clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet
aggregation, but may cause less gastric irritation. They have a role if truly intoler-
ant of aspirin; with aspirin after coronary stent insertion; and in acute coronary
syndrome. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (eg tirofi ban) have a role in unstable
angina/MI.8
Anticoagulants See p350. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs, previously NOACs), eg
Xa inhibitors (eg apixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), are increas-
ingly replacing warfarin9 for treatment of AF and clots, see p350. Warfarin remains
the anticoagulant of choice for mechanical valves. Anticoagulants used in ACS include
treatment dose LMWH, fondaparinux (Xa inhibitor), & bivalirudin (thrombin inhibitor).
-blockers Block -adrenoceptors, thus antagonizing the sympathetic nervous
system. Blocking 1-receptors is negatively inotropic and chronotropic; blocking
2-receptors induces peripheral vasoconst riction and bronchoconstriction. Drugs
vary in their 1/2 selecti vity (eg propranolol is non-selective, and bisoprolol relative-
ly 1 selective), but this does not seem to alter their clinical effi cacy. Uses: Angina,
hypertension, antid ysrhythmic, post MI (mortality), heart failure (with caution). CI:
Severe asthma/COPD, heart block. SES: Lethargy, erectile dysfunction, joie de vivre,
nightmares, headache.
ACE inhibitors These are used in hypertension (HT), heart failure, and post-MI. First
dose HT is a concern in patients with severe CCF and malignant HT. In CCF patients,
reduce diuretic dose initially and use long-acting ACE-i. Monitor U&E when starting or
raising ACE-i dose, a creatinine rise of >20% is concerning. If the patient starts ACE-i
prior to discharge, ask the GP to check U&E in 1–2 weeks. If renal function deteriorates
markedly, consider investigating for renal artery stenosis. The risk to the kidneys is
greater when the patient is unwell. Hold in AKI and hyperkalaemia; avoid starting if
the patient is dehydrated. SES: Include dry cough and urticaria.
Diuretics
• Loop diuretics (eg furosemide) are used in heart failure, and inhibit the Na/2Cl/K
co-transporter. SES: dehydration, Na+,K+, Ca2+, ototoxic
• Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics are used in hypertension (eg indapamide) and
heart failure (eg metolazone). SE: K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, urate (±gout), impotence (NB:
small doses, eg chlortalidone 25mg/24h rarely cause signifi cant SEs)
• Potassium-sparing diuretics: aldosterone antagonists (eg spironolactone,
eplerenone) directly block aldosterone receptors; amiloride blocks the epithelial
sodium channel in the distal convoluted tubules.
Vasodilators Used in heart failure, IHD, and hypertension. Nitrates (p116) preferen-
tially dilate veins and the large arteries,  fi lling pressure (pre-load), while hydrala-
zine (often used with nitrates) primarily dilates the resistance vessels, thus  BP
(after-load). Prazosin (an -blocker) dilates arteries and veins.
Calcium antagonists These  cell entry of Ca2+ via voltage-sensitive channels in
smooth muscle, thereby promoting coronary and peripheral vasodilat ion and reduc-
ing myocardial oxygen consumption. All current drugs block L-type Ca2+ channels.
However, their eff ects diff er because of diff erential binding properties.
• The dihydropyridines, eg nifed ipine, amlodipine, are mainly peripheral vasodilators
(also dilate coronary arteries) and cause a refl ex tachycardia, so are often used
with a -blocker. They are used mainly in hypertension and angina.
• The non-dihydropyridines—verapamil and diltiazem—also slow conduction at the
AV and SA nodes and may be used to treat hypertension, angina, and dysrhythmias.
 Don’t give non-dihydropyridines with -blockers (risk of severe bradycardia ± LVF).
SES: Flushes, headache, ankle oedema (diuretic unresponsive), LV function, gingival
hypertrophy. CI: Heart block.

Digoxin Blocks the Na+/K+ pump. It is used to slow the pulse in fast AF (p130; aim for
100). As it is a weak +ve inotrope, its role in heart failure in sinus rhythm may be
best reserved if symptomatic despite optimal ACE-i therapy; 10 here there is little ben-
efi t vis-à-vis mortality (but admissions for worsening CCF are  by ~25%).11 Elderly
people are at risk of toxicity: use lower doses. Measure plasma levels >6h post-dose
(p756). Typical dose: 500mcg stat PO, repeated after 12h, then 125mcg (if elderly) to
250mcg/d PO OD (62.5mcg/d is almost never enough). IV dose: 0.75–1mg in 0.9% NaCl
over 2h. Toxicity risk if: K+, Mg2+, or Ca2+. t½ ≈ 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy
in cardioversion (start at 5J). If on amiodarone, halve the dose of digoxin. SES:
Any arrhythmia (supraventr icular tachycardia with AV block is suggestive), nausea,
appetite, yellow vision, confusion, gynaecomastia. If toxicity is suspected, do an ECG
(fi g 3.19), digoxin levels, and check K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. If toxicity is confi rmed, stop
digoxin, correct electrolyte imbalances, treat arrhyt hmias, and consider IV DigiFab®
(p842). CIS: HCM; WPW syndrome (p133).
Fig 3.19 This ECG shows the classic ‘reverse
tick’ of digoxin toxicity: downsloping ST
wave with rapid upstroke back to isoelec-
tric line. The bradycardia is also suggestive
of digoxin toxicity.
Sodium channel blockers Class I anti-arrhythmics. Procainamide (1a) and lido-
caine (1b) can be used to terminate VT. NB QT interval may be prolonged. Flecainide
(1c) is useful for AF cardioversion in patients without contraindications, and for ar-
rhythmia prophylaxis in patients with WPW or troublesome paroxysmal AF. CIS: Heart
failure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block.
Amiodarone A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action
potential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventric-
ular and ventricular tachycardias, including during cardiac arrest. Broad range of
side eff ects incl. thyroid disease, liver disease, pulmonary fi brosis and peripheral
neuropathy. Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months.
Ivabradine Blocks the pacemaker ‘funny current’, slowing pulse rate without sig-
nifi cantly dropping blood pressure. Used in angina, heart failure, and (off -licence)
in autonomic tachycardia syndromes. CIS: Acute MI, bradycardia, long QT syndrome,
shock. Many drug interactions, including with calcium antagonists.
Statins Statins (eg simvastatin, p690) inhibit the enzyme HMG-COA reductase, which
causes de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor ex-
pression by hepatocytes leading to circulating LDL cholesterol. More eff ective if
given at night, but optimum dose and target plasma cholesterol are unknown. SES:
Muscle aches, abdominal discomfort, transaminases (eg ALT), CK, myositis, rarely
rhabdo myolysis (more common if used with fi brates). Statins are generally well tol-
erated. There are currently ~3 million people taking statins in England, which saves
~10 000 lives a year. See also hyperlipidaemia, pp690–1, fi g 14.13.
Anti-anginal drugs p116. Antihypertensives p140.
Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node
Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AVN) include di-
goxin, verapamil, and adenosine. Uses include cardioverting AVNRT and diagnos-
ing atrial tachycardias.
Drugs that slow AVN conduction should be avoided in patients with aberrant
pathways (eg WPW) as blocking the AVN can increase conduction via the alterna-
tive pathways. AVN blockers are contraindicated in patients with or at risk of VT, eg
those with long QT syndrome.

Angina pectoris
If ACS is a possible diagnosis (including unstable angina), see pp798–801.
Angina12 is symptomatic reversible myocardial ischaemia. Features:
1 Constricting/heavy discomfort to the chest, jaw, neck, shoulders, or arms.
2 Symptoms brought on by exertion.
3 Symptoms relieved within5 min by rest or GTN.
All 3 features = typical angina; 2 features = atypical angina; 0–1 features = non-
anginal chest pain.
Other precipitants: emotion, cold weather, and heavy meals. Associated symptoms:
dyspnoea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness. Features that make angina less likely: pain
that is continuous, pleuritic or worse with swallowing; pain associated with palpita-
tions, dizziness or tingling.
Causes Atheroma. Rarely: anaemia; coronary artery spasm; AS; tachyarrhythmias;
HCM; arteritis/small vessel disease (microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome X).
Types of angina Stable angina: Induced by eff ort, relieved by rest. Good prognosis.
Unstable angina: (Crescendo angina.) Angina of increasing frequency or severity;
occurs on minimal exertion or at rest; associated with risk of MI. Decubitus angina:
Precipitated by lying fl at. Variant (Prinzmetal) angina: (BOX ‘Vasospastic angina’)
Caused by coronary artery spasm (rare; may coexist with fi xed stenoses).
Tests ECG usually normal, but may show ST depression; fl at or inverted T waves; signs
of past MI. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, TFTs, lipids, HbA1c. Consider echo and chest X-ray.
Further investigations are usually necessary to confi rm an IHD diagnosis—see BOX.
Management
Address exacerbating factors: Anaemia, tachycardia (eg fast AF), thyrotoxicosis.
Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease:
• Stop smoking; exercise; dietary advice; optimize hypertension and diabetes control.
• 75mg aspirin daily if not contraindicated.
• Address hyperlipidaemia—see p690.
• Consider ACE inhibitors, eg if diabetic.
PRN symptom relief: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray or sublingual tabs. Advise the pa-
tient to repeat the dose if the pain has not gone after 5min and to call an ambulance
if the pain is still present 5min after the second dose. SE: headaches, BP.
Anti-anginal medication: (p114) First line: -blocker and/or calcium channel blocker
(do not combine -blockers with non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists). If
these fail to control symptoms or are not tolerated, trial other agents.
• -blockers: eg atenolol 50mg BD or bisoprolol 5–10mg OD.
• Calcium antagonists: amlodipine—start at 5mg OD; diltiazem—dose depends on
formulation.
• Long-acting nitrates: eg isosorbide mononitrate—starting regimen depends on
formulation. Alternatives: GTN skin patches. SES: headaches, BP.
• Ivabradine: reduces heart rate with minimal impact on BP. Patient must be in sinus
rhythm. Start with 5mg BD (2.5mg in elderly).
• Ranolazine: inhibits late Na+ current. Start at 375mg BD. Caution if heart failure,
elderly, weight <60kg or prolonged QT interval.
• Nicorandil: a K+ channel activator. Start with 5–10mg BD. CI: acute pulmonary oede-
ma, severe hypotension, hypovolaemia, LV failure.
Revascularization: Considered when optimal medical therapy proves inadequate.
• Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): (p112) a balloon is infl ated inside the
stenosed vessel, opening the lumen. A stent is usually inserted to reduce the risk
of re-stenosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; usually aspirin and clopidogel) is
recommended for at least 12 months after stent insertion to reduce the risk of in-
stent thrombosis. Specialist advice should be sought regarding antiplatelets if the
patient has a high bleeding risk or requires surgery.
• CABG: (p123) compared to PCI, patients undergoing CABG are less likely to need re-
peat revascularization and those with multivessel disease can expect better out-
comes. However, CABG is open heart surgery and so recovery is slower and the
patient is left with two large wounds (sternal and vein harvesting).

Investigating patients with ? stable angina
Investigations for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) include:
• Exercise ECG—assess for ischaemic ECG changes.
• Angiography—either using cardiac CT with contrast, or transcatheter angiogra-
phy (more invasive but can be combined with stenting, p112).
• Functional imaging (see p108): myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echo
(echo whilst undergoing exercise or receiving dobutamine), cardiac MRI.
NICE recommend the following investigations when considering stable angina.13
Typical angina in a patient with previously proven IHD:
Treat as stable angina; if further confi rmation is required, use non-invasive testing,
eg exercise ECG.
Typical and atypical angina:
CT angiography, fi g 3.20. If inconclusive, use functional imaging as 2nd line and
transcatheter angiography as 3rd line.
Non-anginal chest pain:
Does the patient have ischaemic changes on 12 lead ECG?
• Yes: investigate as per typical and atypical angina
• No: no further investigations for IHD at this point (unless high clinical suspicion
of IHD for other reasons—discuss with a specialist). Ensure alternative chest pain
diagnoses are adequately explored.
These are guidelines and must be interpreted within the clinical context.
Further investigations:
If the patient has typical angina but few risk factors for IHD, be sure to look for
possible precipitating or exacerbating factors, for example severe anaemia or
cardiomyopathy.

Vasospastic angina (Prinzmetal angina)
Angina due to coronary artery spasm, which can occur even in normal coronary
arteries. The pain usually occurs during rest and resolves rapidly with short-acting
nitrates (eg GTN spray). ECG during pain shows ST segment elevation.
Risks and triggers: Smoking increases risk but hypertension and hypercholester-
olaemia do not. Probable triggers include cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, low
magnesium, and artery instrumentation (eg during angiography).
Treatment: Avoid triggers. Correct low magnesium. Stop smoking. PRN GTN. Cal-
cium channel blockers ± long-acting nitrates. Avoid non-selective -blockers, aspi-
rin, and triptans. Prognosis is usually very good.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS)
Defi nitions ACS includes unstable angina and myocardial infarctions (MIs). These
share a common underlying pathology—plaque rupture, thrombosis, and infl amma-
tion. However, ACS may rarely be due to emboli, coronary spasm, or vasculitis (p556)
in normal coronary arteries. Myocardial infarction means there is myocardial cell
death, releasing troponin. Ischaemia means a lack of blood supply, ±cell death. MIS
have troponin rises, unstable angina does not. An MI may be a STEMI—ACS with ST-
segment elevation (may only be present in V7–V9 if posterior STEMI) or new-onset
LBBB; or an NSTEMI—trop-positive ACS without ST-segment elevation—the ECG may
show ST depression, T-wave inversion, non-specifi c changes, or be normal. The de-
gree of irreversible myocyte death varies, and signifi cant necrosis can occur without
ST elevation.
Risk factors Non-modifi able: age,  gender, family history of IHD (MI in 1st-degree
relative <55yrs). Modifi able: smoking, hypertension, DM, hyperlipida emia, obesity,
sedentary lifestyle, cocaine use. Controversial risk factors include: stress, type A
personality, LVH, fi brinogen, hyperinsulinaemia, homocysteine levels, ACE genotype.
Incidence 5/1000 per annum (UK) for ST-segment elevation (declining in UK & USA).
Diagnosis An increase in cardiac biomarkers (eg troponin) and either: symptoms of
ischaemia, ECG changes of new ischaemia, development of pathological Q waves, new
loss of myocardium, or regional wall motion abnormalities on imaging.
Symptoms Acute central chest pain, lasting >20min, often associated with nausea,
sweatiness, dyspnoea, palpitations. ACS without chest pain is called ‘silent’; mostly
seen in elderly and diabetic patients. Silent MIs may present with: syncope, pulmo-
nary oedema, epigastric pain and vomiting, post-operative hypotension or oliguria,
acute confusional state, stroke, and diabetic hyperglycaemic states.
Signs Distress, anxiety, pallor, sweatiness, pulse  or , BP  or , 4th heart sound.
There may be signs of heart failure (JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal crepitations) or a
pansystolic murmur (papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD). Low-grade fever
may be present. Later, a pericardial friction rub or peripheral oedema may develop.
Tests ECG: (See fi g 3.21.) STEMI: classically, hyperacute (tall) T waves, ST elevation,
or new LBBB occur within hours. T-wave inversion and pathological Q waves follow
over hours to days (p98). NSTEMI/unstable angina: ST depression, T wave inversion,
non-specifi c changes, or normal. In 20% of MI, the ECG may be normal initially.
Paced ECGs and ECGs with chronic bundle branch block are unhelpful for diagnos-
ing NSTEMIs14 and may hinder STEMI15 diagnosis; in these cases, clinical assessment
and troponin levels are especially important. CXR: Look for cardiomegaly, pulmonary
oedema, or a widened mediastinum. Don’t routinely delay treatment whilst waiting
for a CXR. Blood: FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids, cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes: (See
BOX ’Troponin‘.) Cardiac troponin levels (T and I) are the most sensitive and spe-
cifi c markers of myocardial necrosis. Diff erent hospitals use diff erent assays: check
the required timing of troponin blood samples where you work (eg two samples 3h
apart). Other cardiac enzymes (see fi g 3.22) are sensitive but less specifi c; their role
in ACS diagnosis is decreasing as troponin testing improves. Echo: Regional wall
abnormalities.
Diff erential diagnosis (p94.) Stable angina, pericarditis, myocarditis, Takotsubo
cardiomyopathy (p145), aortic dissection (p655), PE, oesophageal refl ux/spasm, pneu-
mothorax, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis.
Management See p120, pp798–801.
Mortality 50% of deaths occur within 2h of onset of symptoms. Up to 7% die before
discharge. Worse prognosis if: elderly, LV failure, and ST changes. 16

Fig 3.21 Sequential ECG changes following acute MI.
Fig 3.22 Enzyme changes following acute MI. Increasingly, high-sensitivity troponins are used
alone for routine investigation of ACS.
Troponin
Troponins are proteins involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction
(fi g 3.23). When myocardial cells are damaged, troponins are released and en-
ter the bloodstream. The levels of troponin in the blood can therefore help with
diagnosing myocardial damage. Troponins I and T are most specifi c to the heart.
Troponin levels are most commonly measured when ACS is suspected. In this
circumstance, one would expect troponin levels to rise in the hours following the
insult (fi g 3.22). Troponin levels can be high with other causes of myocardial dam-
age, for example myocarditis, pericarditis, and ventricular strain. With these con-
ditions, the troponin levels are likely to change little hour by hour as the insults are
ongoing. Discrete episodes of tachyarrhythmias may cause troponin rises similar
to in ACS. Troponin levels can also be raised iatrogenically, eg following CPR, DC
cardioversion, ablation therapy.
A troponin rise may have a non-cardiac aetiology. This can be indirectly related
to the heart, eg a massive PE causing right ventricular strain, or have no clear car-
diac connection, eg subarachnoid haemorrhage, burns, or sepsis. A common cause
of consistently elevated troponin is renal failure. Hence, when measuring troponin,
change in level is often more important than the level itself.

sin heads can bind to the actin chain, shortening the muscle fi bre.

Management of ACS
ACS management depends on whether the ACS is ‘ST elevated’ or not:
1 ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI): this category includes ACS with ST el-
evation on ECG (fi g 3.9) but also ACS with new LBBB (fi g 3.7); and posterior MIs
(fi g 3.24) where ST elevation may only be seen with extra leads (V7–V9). Urgent
revascularization is essential. p796.
2 ACS without ST elevation: serial troponins are needed to diff erentiate non-ST el-
evated MIs (NSTEMIs) (trop rise) from unstable angina (no trop rise). p798.
After the immediate actions described on pp796–9, treatment of ACS17 focuses on
managing symptoms, secondary prevention of further cardiovascular disease, revas-
cularization (if not already undertaken), and addressing complications.
Symptom control
Manage chest pain with PRN GTN and opiates. If this proves insuffi cient, consider a
GTN infusion (monitor BP, omit if recent sildenafi l use). If pain is deteriorating, seek
senior help. Manage symptomatic heart failure, p136.
Modify risk factors
• Patients should be strongly advised and helped to stop smoking (p93).
• Identify and treat diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.
• Advise a diet high in oily fi sh, fruit, vegetables, & fi bre, and low in saturated fats.
• Encourage daily exercise. Refer to a cardiac rehab programme.
• Mental health: fl ag to the patient’s GP if depression or anxiety are present—these
are independently associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes.
Optimize cardioprotective medications
• Antiplatelets: aspirin (75mg OD) and a second antiplatelet agent (eg clopidogrel)
for at least 12 months to vascular events (eg MI, stroke). Consider adding a PPI (eg
lansoprazole) for gastric protection.
• Anticoagulate, eg with fondaparinux, until discharge.
• -blockade reduces myocardial oxygen demand. Start low and increase slowly,
monitoring pulse and BP. If contraindicated, consider verapamil or diltiazem.
• ACE-i in patients with LV dysfunction, hypertension, or diabetes unless not tolerated
(consider ARB). Titrate up slowly, monitoring renal function.
• High-dose statin, eg atorvastatin 80mg.
• Do an echo to assess LV function. Eplerenone improves outcomes in MI patients
with heart failure (ejection fraction <40%).
Revascularization
• STEMI patients and very high-risk NSTEMI patients (eg haemodynamically unstable)
should receive immediate angiography ± PCI. NSTEMI patients who are high risk (eg
GRACE score >140) should have angiography within 24h; intermediate risk (eg GRACE
109–140) within 3d; low-risk patients may be considered for non-invasive testing.
• Patients with multivessel disease may be considered for CABG instead of PCI (p123).
Manage complications See p122.
Discharge Address any questions the patient has. Discuss ‘red fl ag’ symptoms and
where to seek medical advice should they arise. Ensure the management plan is
communicated to the patient’s GP. Book clinic and cardiac rehab appointments.
General advice
• Driving:18 drivers with group 1 licences (car and motorcycle) can resume driving
1wk after successful angioplasty, or 4wk after ACS without successful angioplasty,
if their ejection fraction is >40%. Group 2 licence holders must inform the DVLA of
their ACS and stop driving; depending on the results of functional tests, they may
be able to restart after 6wk.
• Work: how soon a patient can return to work will depend on their clinical progress
and the nature of their work. They should be encouraged to discuss speed of return
± changes in duties (eg to lighter work if manual labour) with their employer. Some
occupations cannot be restarted post-MI: eg airline pilots & air traffi c controllers.
Drivers of public service or heavy goods vehicles will have to undergo functional
testing (eg exercise test), as mentioned previously.

Fig 3.24 Acute postero-lateral MI. The posterior infarct is evidenced by the reciprocal changes seen in V1–3: dominant R waves (‘upside-down’ pathological Q waves)
and ST depression (‘upside-down’ ST elevation). If extra chest leads were added (V7–9), we would see the classic ST elevation pattern, see p 98. The ST elevation in V6 sug-
gests lateral infarction. A blockage in the circumfl ex coronary artery could explain both the posterior and lateral changes.

Complications of MI
Cardiac arrest (See p894, fi g A3.) Cardiogenic shock (p802.) Left ventricular
failure (p136, p800, p802.)
Bradyarrhythmias Sinus bradycardia: See p808. Patients with inferior MIs may
suff er atropine-unresponsive bradycardia due to infarction of nodal tissue. 1st-de-
gree AV block: Most commonly seen in inferior MI. Observe closely as approximately
40% develop higher degrees of AV block (in which case calcium channel blockers and
-blockers should be stopped). Wenckebach phenomenon: (Mobitz type I) Does not
require pacing unless poorly tolerated. Mobitz type II block: Carries a high risk of
developing sudden complete AV block; should be paced. Complete AV block: Usually
resolves within a few days. Insert pacemaker (may not be necessary after inferior
MI if narrow QRS, reasonably stable and pulse 40–50). Bundle branch block: MI
complicated by trifascicular block or non-adjacent bifascicular disease (p132) should
be paced.
Tachyarrhythmias NB: K+, hypoxia, and acidosis all predispose to arrhythmias and
should be corrected. Sinus tachycardia: Can  myocardial O2 demand, treat causes
(pain, hypoxia, sepsis, etc.) and add -blocker if not contraindicated. SVT: p126. AF
or fl utter: If compromised, DC cardioversion. Otherwise, medical therapy as per
p130. Frequent PVCs (premature ventricular complexes) and non-sustained VT (≥3
consecutive PVCS >100bpm and lasting <30s) are common after acute MI and are as-
sociated with increased risk of sudden death. Correct hypokalaemia and hypomag-
nesaemia and ensure the patient is on -blockers, if not contraindicated.19 Sustained
VT: (Consecutive PVCS >100bpm and lasting >30s.) Treat with synchronized DC shock
(if no pulse, treat as per advanced life support algorithm, see p894, fi g A3). Use
anti-arrhythmics only if VT recurrent and not controlled with shocks. Consider abla-
tion +/or ICD. Ventricular fi brillation: 80% occurs within 12h. VF occuring after 48h
usually indicates pump failure or cardiogenic shock. : DC shock (see p894, fi g A3),
consider ICD.
Right ventricular failure (RVF)/infarction Presents with low cardiac output and
JVP. Fluid is key; avoid vasodilators (eg nitrates) and diuretics.20 Inotropes are re-
quired in some cases.
Pericarditis Central chest pain, relieved by sitting forwards. ECG: saddle-shaped ST
elevation, see fi g 3.51, p155. Treatment: NSAIDS. Echo to check for eff usion.
Systemic embolism May arise from LV mural thrombus. After large anterior MI,
consider anticoagulation with warfarin for 3 months.
Cardiac tamponade (p802) Presents with low cardiac output, pulsus paradoxus,
Kussmaul’s sign,3 muffl ed heart sounds. Diagnosis: echo. Treatment: pericardial aspi-
ration (provides temporary relief, see p773 for technique), surgery.
Mitral regurgitation May be mild (minor papillary muscle dysfunction) or severe
(chordal or papillary muscle rupture secondary to ischaemia). Presentation: pulmo-
nary oedema. Treat LVF (p800) and consider valve replacement.
Ventricular septal defect Presents with pansystolic murmur, JVP, cardiac failure.
Diagnosis: echo. Treatment: surgery. 50% mortality in fi rst week.
Late malignant ventricular arrhythmias Occur 1–3wks post-MI and are the cardi-
ologist’s nightmare. Avoid hypokalaemia, the most easily avoidable cause. Consider
24h ECG monitoring prior to discharge if large MI.
Dressler’s syndrome (p698) Recurrent pericarditis, pleural eff usions, fever, anae-
mia, and ESR 1–3wks post-MI. Treatment: consider NSAIDS; steroids if severe.
Left ventricular aneurysm This occurs late (4–6wks post-MI), and presents with
LVF, angina, recurrent VT, or systemic embolism. ECG: persistent ST-segment elevation.
Treatment: anticoagulate, consider excision.
3 JVP rises during inspiration. Adolf Kussmaul was a prominent 19th-century physician and the fi rst to
attempt gastroscopy. Inspired by a sword swallower he passed a rigid tube into the stomach, however light
technology was limited and it was not until years later that gastroscopists could visualize the stomach.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
CABG is performed in left main stem disease; multi-vessel disease; multiple se-
vere stenoses; patients unsuitable for angioplasty; failed angioplasty; refractory
angina.
Indications for CABG—to improve survival:
• Left main stem disease.
• Triple-vessel disease involving proximal part of the left anterior descending.
Indications for CABG—to relieve symptoms:
• Angina unresponsive to drugs.
• Unstable angina (sometimes).
• If angioplasty is unsuccessful.
NB: when CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, eg angioplasty) are
both clinically valid options, NICE recommends that the availability of new stent
technology should push the decision towards PCI. In practice, patients with single-
vessel coronary artery disease and normal LV function usually undergo PCI, and
those with triple-vessel disease and abnormal LV function more often undergo
CABG.
Compared with PCI, CABG results in longer recovery time and length of inpatient
stay. Recent RCTs indicate that early procedural mortality rates and 5-year survival
rates are similar after PCI and CABG. Compared with PCI, CABG probably provides
more complete long-term relief of angina in patients, and less repeated revascu-
larization.
Procedure: The heart is usually stopped and blood pumped artifi cially by a ma-
chine outside the body (cardiac bypass). Minimally invasive thoracotomies not
requiring this are well described, 21 but randomized trials are few. The patient’s
own saphenous vein or internal mammary artery is used as the graft. Several
grafts may be placed. >50% of vein grafts close in 10yrs (low-dose aspirin helps
prevent this). Internal mammary artery grafts last longer (but may cause chest-
wall numbness).
On-pump or off-pump:
Seems to make little diff erence. 22
After CABG: If angina persists or recurs (from poor graft run-off , distal disease,
new atheroma, or graft occlusion) restart antianginal drugs, and consider an-
gioplasty. Ensure optimal management of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipi-
daemia, and that smoking is addressed. Continue aspirin 75mg OD indefi nitely;
consider clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated. Mood, sex, and intellectual prob-
lems 23 are common early. Rehabilitation helps:
• Exercise: walkcycleswimjog.
• Drive at 1 month: no need to tell DVLA if non-HGV licences, p158.
• Return to work, eg at 3 months.

Arrhythmias—overview
Disturbances of cardiac rhythm (arrhythmias) are:
• common
• often benign (but may refl ect underlying heart disease)
• often intermittent, causing diagnostic diffi culty see BOX ‘Continuous ECG monitoring’
• occasionally severe, causing cardiac compromise which may be fatal.
Emergency management: pp804–9.
Causes Cardiac: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD); structural changes, eg left atrial
dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation; cardiomyopathy; pericarditis; myo-
carditis; aberrant conduction pathways. Non-cardiac: Caff eine; smoking; alcohol;
pneumonia; drugs (2-agonists, digoxin, L-dopa, tricyclics, doxorubicin); metabolic
imbalance (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, hypoxia, hypercapnia, metabolic acidosis, thyroid disease);
and phaeochromocytoma.
Presentation Palpitations, chest pain, presyncope/syncope, hypotension, or pulmo-
nary oedema. Some arrhythmias may be asymptomatic, incidental fi ndings, eg AF.
History Take a detailed history of palpitations (p36). Ask about precipitating fac-
tors, onset/off set, nature (fast or slow, regular or irregular), duration, associated
symptoms (chest pain, dyspnoea, collapse). Review drug history. Ask about past
medical history and family history of cardiac disease and sudden death. Syncope
occuring during exercise is always concerning; the patient may have a condition
predisposing them to sudden cardiac death (eg long QT syndrome).
Tests FBC, U&E, glucose, Ca2+, Mg2+, TSH, ECG: Look for signs of IHD, AF, short PR interval
(WPW syndrome), long QT interval (metabolic imbalance, drugs, congenital), U waves
(hypokalaemia). 24h ECG monitoring or other continuous ECG monitoring (see BOX
‘Continuous ECG monitoring’). Echo to look for structural heart disease, eg mitral
stenosis, HCM. Provocation tests: exercise ECG, cardiac catheterization ± electro-
physiological studies may be needed.
Narrow complex tachycardias: See pp806–7, 126.
Atrial fi brillation and fl utter: See pp806–7, 130.
Broad complex tachycardias: See pp804–5, 128.
Bradycardia: See p808 (causes and management of acute bradycardia) and p98
(heart block). Intermittent, self-resolving bradycardic episodes can cause signifi cant
problems (eg recurrent syncope). Continuous ECG monitoring (BOX ‘Continuous ECG
monitoring’) will be needed to assist the diagnosis ±specialist tests (eg tilt table
testing for refl ex syncope). Seek out reversible causes, eg hypothyroidism or medica-
tions such as -blockers. In some cases, no reversible cause is found and the inter-
mittent bradycardia is suffi ciently dangerous to warrant a permanent pacemaker
(p132). See BOX, ‘Sick sinus syndrome’.
Management Some arrhythmias can be managed conservatively, eg by reducing
alcohol intake. Many arrhythmias respond to medical management with regular
tablets or a ‘pill in the pocket’. Interventional management may include pacemakers
(p132), ablation (eg of accessory pathways or arrhythmogenic foci), or implantable
cardioverter defi brillators (ICDs), eg in patients with ventricular arrhythmias post-MI
and in those with congenital arrhythmogenic conditions (p133).

Continuous ECG monitoring
A simple 12-lead ECG only gives a snapshot of the heart’s electrical activities. Many
disorders, particularly the arrhythmias, come and go and so may be missed at the
time of the ECG recording. If you feel you are missing a paroxysmal arrhythmia,
there are many ways of recording the electrical activity over a longer period:
Telemetry: An inpatient wears ECG leads and the signals are shown on screens
being watched by staff . Thus, if a dangerous arrhythmia occurs, help is immedi-
ately available. This is very resource intensive so reserved for those at high risk of
dangerous arrhythmias, eg immediately post-STEMI.
Exercise ECGs: The patient exercises according to a standardized protocol (eg
Bruce on a treadmill) and the BP and ECG are monitored, looking for ischaemic
changes, arrhythmias, and features suggestive of arrhythmia risk, such as delta
waves.
Holter monitors: The patient wears an ECG monitor which records their rhythm
for 24h–7d whilst they go about their normal life, this is later analysed. These can
also be used to pick up ST changes suggestive of ischaemia.
Loop recorders: These record only
when activated by the patient—
they cleverly save a small amount
of ECG data before the event—use-
ful if the arrhythmia causes loss
of consciousness: the patient can
press the button when they wake
up. Loop recorders may be im-
planted just under the skin (eg Re-
veal® or the newer, injectable LINQ
device), and are especially useful in
patients with infrequent episodes
as they can continually monitor for
months or years awaiting an event
(Fig 3.25).

Sick sinus syndrome
Sick sinus syndrome is usually caused by sinus node fi brosis, typically in elderly
patients. The sinus node becomes dysfunctional, in some cases slowing to the
point of sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses, in others generating tachyarrhythmias
such as atrial fi brillation and atrial tachycardia.
Symptoms: Syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations, breathless-
ness.
Management:
• Thromboembolism prophylaxis if episodes of AF are detected.
• Permanent pacemakers for patients with symptomatic bradycardia or sinus
pauses.
Some patients develop a ‘tachy brady syndrome’, suff ering from alternating
tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms. This can prove diffi cult to treat medically
as treating one circumstance (eg tachycardia) increases the risk from the other.
Pacing for bradycardic episodes in combination with rate-slowing medications for
tachycardic episodes may be required if the patient is symptomatic or unstable.

Narrow complex tachycardia
Defi nition ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms. Narrow
QRS complexes occur when the ventricles are depolarized via the normal conduction
pathways (fi g 3.26).
Diff erential diagnosis
Regular narrow complex tachycardias: See fi g 3.27.
Irregular narrow complex tachycardias:
• Normal variant: sinus arrhythmia (rate changes with inspiration/expiration); sinus
rhythm with frequent ectopic beats.
• Atrial fi brillation (AF): p131, fi g 3.35.
• Atrial fl utter with variable block: eg P–P–P–QRS–P–P–QRS (3:1 block then 2:1 block).
The atrial rhythm is regular but the ventricular rhythm (hence pulse) is irregular.
• Multifocal atrial tachycardia: like focal atrial tachycardia but there are multiple
groups of atrial cells taking it in turns to initiate a cardiac cycle. P-wave morphol-
ogy and P-P intervals vary. Usually associated with COPD.
Principles of management See p807.
If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion (p770).
• Identify and treat the underlying rhythm: eg treating sinus tachycardia secondary
to dehydration with IV fl uids; treating multifocal sinus tachycardia secondary to
COPD by correcting hypoxia and hypercapnia; treating focal atrial tachycardia sec-
ondary to digoxin toxicity with digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments; treating AVRT
secondary to WPW with fl ecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone; for atrial fi brilla-
tion (AF) and fl utter see p130.
• If AVNRT or AVRT are suspected, consider transiently blocking the AVN. This should
break the circuit of an atrio-ventricular re-entry rhythm, allowing sinus rhythm to
re-establish. If the underlying rhythm is actually atrial in origin (eg fl utter or atrial
tachycardia), AVN blockade will not treat the rhythm but the paused ventricular
activity will unmask the atrial rhythm (fi g 3.28), aiding diagnosis and management.
AVN blockade can be achieved by:
1 Vagal manoeuvres: carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre (eg blowing into
a syringe).
2 IV adenosine: see p806.
• In some cases, narrow complex tachyarrhythmias cause symptomatic episodes of
suffi cient severity and frequency to warrant more invasive treatment, eg ablation
therapy for accessory pathways.
Fig 3.28 This patient was given adenosine for tachycardia thought to be due to AVRT or AVNRT.
The adenosine has slowed the ventricular rate, revealing fl utter waves (sawtooth appearance),
disproving an AVRT/AVNRT diagnosis.

Holiday heart syndrome
Binge drinking in a person without any clinical evidence of heart disease may
result in acute cardiac rhythm and/or conduction disturbances, which is called
holiday heart syndrome (note that recreational use of marijuana may have similar
eff ects). The most common rhythm disorders are supraventricular tachyarrhyth-
mia and AF (consider this diagnosis in patients without structural heart disease
who present with new-onset AF).
The prognosis is excellent, especially in young patients without structural heart
disease. As holiday heart syndrome resolves rapidly by abstinence from alcohol
use, advise all patients against the excessive use of alcohol in future.

sinus.
C. Atrial fl utter: Electrical activity circles the atria 300 times per minute, giving a
‘sawtooth’ baseline, see fi g 3.35. The AVN passes some of these impulses on, result-
ing in ventricular rates that are factors of 300 (150, 100, 75).
D. Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia: (AVRT) An accessory pathway (eg in
Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW), p133) allows electrical activity from the ventricles
to pass to the resting atrial myocytes, creating a circuit: atria–AVN–ventricles–
accessory pathway–atria. This direction is called ‘orthodromic’ conduction and
results in narrow QRS complexes as ventricular depolarization is triggered via the
bundles of His. Conduction in the other direction is called ‘antidromic’ and results
in broad QRS complexes.
E. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia: (AVNRT) Circuits form within the
AVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very common.
F. Junctional tachycardia: Cells in the AVN become the pacemaker, giving nar-
row QRS complexes as impulses reach the ventricles through the normal routes; P
waves may be inverted and late.
G. Bundle branch block: Any of the above conditions can result in broad complex
tachycardias if there is bundle branch block (see p100).
H. Ventricular tachycardia: (VT) This can result from circuits, similar to atrial
fl utter, or from focuses of rapidly-fi ring cells. The QRS is broad. When a circuit
is in action and its plane rotates, the ECG shows broad complex tachycardia with
regularly increasing and decreasing amplitudes; this is called torsades de pointes.

Broad complex tachycardia
Defi nition ECG shows rate of >100 and QRS complexes >120ms. If no clear QRS com-
plexes, it is VF or asystole (or problems with the ECG machine or stickers).
Principles of management
If the patient is unstable or you are uncertain of what to do, get help fast—the
patient may be periarrest (p804).
• Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly.
• If in doubt, treat as ventricular tachycardia (VT)—the commonest cause.
• Giving AVN blocking agents to treat SVT with aberrancy when the patient is in VT
can cause dangerous haemodynamic instability. Treating for VT when the patient is
actually in SVT has less potential for deterioration.
• If WPW is suspected, avoid drugs that slow AV conduction—see p114.
Diff erential diagnosis
• Ventricular fi brillation—chaotic, no pattern, fi g 3.29.
• Ventricular tachycardia (VT), fi gs 3.12, 3.30.
• Torsade de pointes (polymorphic VT)—VT with varying axis (see fi g 3.31), may look
like VF. QT interval is a predisposing factor.
• Any cause of narrow complex tachycardias (p126) when in combination with bun-
dle branch block or metabolic causes of broad QRS.
• Antidromic AVRT (eg WPW), p127.
Diff erentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy This may be diffi cult; seek expert
help. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular
arrhythmia), a 12-lead ECG, and the response (or lack thereof) to certain medications.
ECG fi ndings in favour of VT:
• +ve or Ωve QRS concordance in all chest leads (ie all +ve (R) or all Ωve (QS)).
• QRS >160ms.
• Marked left axis deviation, or ‘northwest axis’ (QRS positive in aVR).
• AV dissociation (Ps independent of QRSs) or 2:1 or 3:1 Mobitz II heart block.
• Fusion beats or capture beats (fi gs 3.32, 3.33).
• RSR’ pattern where R is taller than R’. (R’ taller than R suggests RBBB.)
Management See page 805.
Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics) These are common and can be symptomatic—
patients describe palpitations, a thumping sensation, or their heart ‘missing a beat’.
The pulse may feel irregular if there are frequent ectopics. On ECG, ventricular ectop-
ics are broad QRS complexes; they may be single or occur in patterns:
• Bigeminy—ectopic every other beat, see fi g 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the
second QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value.
• Trigeminy—every third beat is an ectopic.
• Couplet—two ectopics together.
• Triplet—three ectopics together.
Occasional ventricular ectopics24 in otherwise healthy people are extremely common
and rarely signifi cant. Frequent ectopics (>60/hour), particularly couplets and tri-
plets, should prompt testing for underlying cardiac conditions. Post-MI, ventricular
ectopics are associated with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias. Pay attention
to whether the ectopics all ‘look’ the same on the ECG suggesting a single focus
(monomorphic) or may come from multiple foci (polymorphic). Causes and manage-
ment can be diff erent.

Atrial fi brillation (AF) and fl utter
AF25 is a chaotic, irregular atrial rhythm at 300–600bpm (fi g 3.35); the AV node re-
sponds inter mittently, hence an irregular ventricular rhythm. Cardiac output drops
by 10–20% as the ventricles aren’t primed reliably by the atria. AF is common in the el-
derly (≤9%). The main risk is embolic stroke. Warfarin reduces this to 1%/yr from 4%.
So, do an ECG on everyone with an irregular pulse (±24h ECG if dizzy, faints, palpita-
tions, etc.). If AF started more than 48h ago, intracardiac clots may have formed, ne-
cessitating anticoagulation prior to cardioversion. see BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’.
Causes Heart failure; hypertension; IHD (seen in 22% MI patients); 26 PE; mitral valve
disease; pneumonia; hyperthyroidism; caff eine; alcohol; post-op; K+; Mg2+. Rare
causes: Cardiom yopathy; constrictive pericarditis; sick sinus syndrome; lung cancer;
endo carditis; haemochromatosis; sarcoid. ‘Lone’ AF means no cause found.
Symptoms May be asymptomatic or cause chest pain, palpitations, dyspn oea, or
faintness. Signs Irregularly irregular pulse, the apical pulse rate is greater than
the radial rate, and the 1st heart sound is of variable intensity; signs of LVF (p800).
Examine the whole patient: AF is often associated with non-cardiac disease.
Tests ECG shows absent P waves, irregular QRS complexes, fi g 3.35. Blood tests: U&E,
cardiac enzymes, thyroid function tests. Echo to look for left atrial enlarge ment,
mitral valve disease, poor LV function, and other structural abnormalities.
Managing acute AF
• If the patient has adverse signs (shock, myocardial ischaemia (chest pain or ECG
changes), syncope, heart failure): ABCDE, get senior input DC cardioversion (syn-
chronized shock, start at 120–150J) ± amiodarone if unsuccessful (p807); do not
delay treatment in order to start anticoagulation.
• If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago: rate or rhythm control may be tried.
For rhythm control, DC cardiovert or give fl ecainide (CI: structural heart disease,
IHD) or amiodarone. Start heparin in case cardioversion is delayed (see BOX ‘Anti-
coagulation and AF’).
• If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset: rate control
(eg with bisoprolol or diltiazem). If rhythm control is chosen, the patient must be
anticoagulated for >3wks fi rst.
• Correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+);  associated illnesses (eg MI, pneu-
monia); and consider anticoagulation (see BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’).
Managing chronic AF
The main goals are rate control and anticoagulation. Rate control is at least as good
as rhythm control, 27 but rhythm control may be appropriate if • symptomatic or CCF
• younger • presenting for 1st time with lone AF • AF from a corrected precipitant (eg
U&E). Anticoagulation: See BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’.
Rate control: -blocker or rate-limiting Ca2+ blocker are 1st choice. If this fails, add
digoxin (p115), then consider amiodarone. Digoxin as monotherapy in chronic AF is
only acceptable in sedentary patients. Do not give -blockers with verapamil. Aim
for heart rate <90bpm at rest and 200 minus age (yrs) bpm on exertion. Avoid getting
fi xated on a target heart rate.
Rhythm control: Elective DC cardioversion: do echo fi rst to check for intracardiac
thrombi. If there is risk of cardioversion failure (past failure, or past recurrence)
give amiodarone for 4wks before the procedure and 12 months after. Elective phar-
macological cardioversion: fl ecainide is 1st choice (CI if structural heart disease, eg
scar tissue from MI: use IV amiodarone instead). In refractory cases, AVN ablation
with pacing, pulmonary vein ablation, or the maze procedure may be considered.28
Paroxysmal AF: ‘Pill in the pocket’ (eg sotalol or fl ecainide PRN) may be tried if: infre-
q uent AF, BP >100mmHg systolic, no past LV dysfunction. Anticoagulate (See BOX
‘Anticoagulation and AF’). Consider ablation if symptomatic or frequent episodes.
Atrial fl utter See pp130–1, fi g 3.35. Treatment: Similar to AF regarding rate and
rhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.29 DC cardioversion is preferred to
pharmacological cardioversion; start with 70–120J. IV amiodarone may be needed if
rate control is proving diffi cult. Recurrence rates are high so radiofrequency ablation
is often recommended for long-term management.

Anticoagulation and AF
Acute AF: Use heparin until a full risk assessment for emboli (see below) is made—
eg AF started <48h ago and elective cardioversion is being planned. If >48h, ensure
≥3wks of therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardiov ersion; NB trans-oe-
sophageal-guided cardioversion is an option if urgent cardioversion is required.
Use a DOAC (eg apixaban) or warfarin (target INR 2–3) if high risk of emboli (past
ischaemic stroke, TIA, or emboli; 75yrs with BP, DM; coronary or peripheral arte-
rial disease; evidence of valve disease or LV function/CCF—only do echo if unsure). 30
Use no anticoagulation if stable sinus rhythm has been restored, no risk factors
for emboli, and AF recurrence unlikely (ie no failed cardioversions, no structural
heart disease, no previous recurrences, no sustained AF for >1yr).
Chronic AF: Chronic AF may be paroxysmal (terminates in <7d but may recur),
persistent (lasts >7d), or permanent (long-term, continuous AF, sinus rhythm not
achievable despite treatment). In all cases, the need for anticoagulation should be
assessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess embolic stroke risk (consider anti-
coagulation if score  >0,  >1), and balancing this against the risks of anticoagula-
tion to the patient, assessed with the HAS-BLED score. Long-term anticoagulation
should be with a DOAC (see p350) or warfarin.
CHA2DS2-VASc—Congestive cardiac failure (1 point), Hypertension (1), Age
65–74y (1), Age >74y (2), Diabetes (1), previous Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2),
Vascular disease (1), Sex Category (1 if female). A score of 2 = an annual stroke risk
of 2.2%. Online calculators can be helpful, eg www.mdcalc.com.
HAS-BLED—1 point for each of: • labile INR • age >65 • use of medications that can
predispose to bleeding (eg NSAIDs, anti-platelets) • alcohol abuse • uncontrolled
hypertension • history of, or predisposition to, major bleeding • renal disease • liver
disease • stroke history.
Pre-excited AF
In pre-excited AF, accessory pathways capable of conducting at rapid rates (eg
sometimes in WPW syndrome) pass erratic electrical activity from the atria to the
ventricles, unfi ltered by the AVN. ECGs will show irregular, broad QRS complexes at
>200bpm. Ventricles cannot sustain this rate for long; the patient is at high risk
of VT and VF.

Pacemakers
In normal circumstances the SAN plays the role of pacemaker. On occasion, other
areas of myocardium will set the pace (see earlier in chapter). If the heart is not
pacing itself fast enough, artifi cial pacing may be required. Options include ‘percus-
sion pacing’—fi st strikes to the precordium, used only in periarrest situations; trans-
cutaneous pacing—electrical stimulation via defi brillator pads (p770); temporary
transvenous pacing (p776); and a subcutaneously implanted permanent pacemaker.
Indications for temporary cardiac pacing include
• Symptomatic bradycardia, unresponsive to atropine.
• After acute anterior MI, prophylactic pacing is required in:
• complete AV block
• Mobitz type I AV block (Wenckebach)
• Mobitz type II AV block
• non-adjacent bifascicular, or trifascicular block (p100).
• After inferior MI, pacing may not be needed in complete AV block if reasonably
stable, rate is >40–50, and QRS complexes are narrow.
• Suppression of drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias by overdrive pacing, eg SVT, VT.
• Special situations: during general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during elec-
trophysiological studies; drug overdose (eg digoxin, -blockers, verapamil).
See p776 for further details and insertion technique.
Indications for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) include
• Complete AV block (Stokes–Adams attacks, asymptomatic, congenital).
• Mobitz type II AV block (p99).
• Persistent AV block after anterior MI.
• Symptomatic bradycardias (eg sick sinus syndrome, p125).
• Heart failure (cardiac resynchronization therapy).
• Drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias.
Pre-operative assessment Bloods (FBC, clotting screen, renal function), IV cannula,
consent, antibiotics as per local protocol.
Post-operative management Prior to discharge, check wound for bleeding or hae-
matoma; check lead positions and for pneumothorax on CXR; check pacemaker func-
tion. During 1st week, inspect for wound haematoma or dehiscence. Other problems:
lead fracture or dislodgement; pacemaker interference (eg from patient’s muscles);
infected device. The battery needs changing every 5–10 years. For driving rules see
p158.
Pacemaker letter codes These enable pacemaker identifi cation (min is 3 letters):
• 1st letter the chamber paced (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber).
• 2nd letter the chamber sensed (A=atria, V=ventricles, D=dual chamber, O=none).
• 3rd letter the pacemaker response (T=triggered, I=inhibited, D=dual).
• 4th letter (R=rate modulation, P=programmable, M=multiprogrammable).
• 5th letter (P means that in tachyc ardia the pacemaker will pace the patient.
S means that in tachycardia the pacem aker shocks the patient. D=dual ability to
pace and shock. O=neither of these).
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) Improves the synchronization of cardi-
ac contraction and reduces mortality31 in people with symptomatic heart failure who
have an ejection fraction <35% and a QRS duration >120ms.32 It involves biventricular
pacing (both septal and lateral walls of the LV) and, if required, also an atrial lead. It
may be combined with a defi brillator (CRT-D).
ECG of paced rhythms (fi g 3.13 and fi g 3.36). Pacemaker input appears as a vertical
‘spike’ on the ECG. This spike can be very small with modern bipolar pacing systems.
Ventricular pacing usually has a broad QRS morphology (similar to LBBB). Systems are
usually programmed ‘on demand’ so will only pace when necessary. Modern systems
are generally very reliable but pacing spikes with no capture afterwards suggests
a problem. Programming of devices is complicated so seek help early if concerned.
Many pacemakers store intracardiac electrograms which can be accessed to cor-
relate rhythm with any symptoms.

Fig 3.36 ECG of a paced rhythm.
Some pacemaker terms
Fusion beat: Union of native depolarization and pacemaker impulse.
Pseudofusion beat: The pacemaker impulse occurs just after cardiac depolariza-
tion, so it is ineff ective, but it distorts the QRS morphology.
Pseudopseudofusion beat: If a DVI pacemaker gives an atrial spike within a na-
tive QRS complex, the atrial output is non-contributory.
Pacemaker syndrome: In single-chamber pacing, retrograde conduction to the
atria, which then contract during ventricular systole. This leads to retrograde fl ow
in pulmonary veins, and cardiac output, dyspnoea, palpitations, malaise, and even
syncope.
Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia: Retrograde conduction to the atrium is
sensed by the pacemaker and ventricular pacing delivered in response. This again
causes retrograde atrial conduction causing a repetitive sensing/pacing loop. This
can be fi xed by changing pacing programming parameters.
Congenital arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions
As well as the many acquired conditions that can predispose to arrhythmias
(p125), there are a number of congenital conditions. These may be clinically silent
until a fatal attack and are likely to be responsible for most cases of sudden adult
death syndrome (SADS). They include:
WPW syndrome (Wolff -Parkinson-White; fi g 3.37.) Caused by congenital acces-
sory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short
PR interval, wide QRS complex (due to slurred upstroke or ‘delta wave’) and ST-T
changes. Two types: WPW type A (+ve  wave in V1), WPW type B (Ωve  wave in V1).
Tachycardia can be due to an AVRT or pre-excited AF/atrial fl utter (p130). Manage-
ment may include ablation of the accessory pathway.
LQTS (Long QT syndromes.) These are channelopathies that result in prolonged
repolarization phases, predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias; classi-
cally torsades de pointes. p804. Conditions associated with LQTS include Jervell
and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (p702) and Romano–Ward syndrome (p710).
ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.) RV myocardium is re-
placed with fi bro-fatty material. Symptoms: palpitations and syncope during ex-
ercise. ECG changes include epsilon wave; T inversion and broad QRS in V1–V3.
Brugada Sodium channelopathy. Diagnosis: classic coved ST elevation in V1–V3 plus
suggestive clinical history. ECG changes and arrhythmias can be precipitated by
fever, medications (www.brugadadrugs.org), electrolyte imbalances, and ischaemia.
Many of these patients can be treated medically or conservatively but those at
high risk may require an implantable cardiac defi brillator (ICD). Screening family
members is important for picking up undiagnosed cases.
Fig 3.37 This patient has Wolff -Parkinson-White syndrome as they have delta waves (slurred QRS
upstrokes) in beats 1 and 4 of this rhythm strip. The delta wave both broadens the ventricular
complex and shortens the PR interval. If a patient with WPW has AF, avoid AV node blockers such as
diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin—but fl ecainide may be used.

Heart failure—basic concepts
Defi nition Cardiac output is inadequate for the body’s requirements.33
Prevalence 1–3% of the general population; ~10% among elderly patients. 34
Key classifi cations
Systolic failure: Inability of the ventricle to contract normally, resulting in cardiac
output. Ejection fraction (EF) is <40%. Causes: IHD, MI, cardiomyopathy.
Diastolic failure: Inability of the ventricle to relax and fi ll normally, causing fi lling
pressures. Typically EF is >50%, this is termed HFpEF (heart failure with preserved
EF). Causes: ventricular hypertrophy, constrictive pericarditis, tamponade, restric-
tive cardio myopathy, obesity. NB: systolic and diastolic failure pathophysiology often
coexists.
Left ventricular failure (LVF): Symptoms: dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance, fa-
tigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND), nocturnal cough (± pink
frothy sputum), wheeze (cardiac ‘asthma’), nocturia, cold peripheries, weight loss.
Right ventricular failure (RVF): Causes: LVF, pulmonary stenosis, lung disease (cor
pulmonale, see p194). Symptoms: peripheral oedema (up to thighs, sacrum, abdomi-
nal wall), ascites, nausea, anorexia, facial engorgem ent, epistaxis.
LVF and RVF may occur independently, or together as congestive cardiac failure (CCF).
Acute heart failure: Often used exclusively to mean new-onset acute or decom-
pensation of chronic heart failure characterized by pulmonary and/or peripheral
oedema with or without signs of peripheral hypo perfusion. Chronic heart failure:
Develops or progresses slowly. Venous congestion is common but arterial pressure
is well maintained until very late.
Low-output heart failure: Cardiac output is  and fails to  normally with exertion.
Causes:
• Excessive preload: eg mitral regurgitation or fl uid overload (eg renal failure or too
rapid IV infusions, particularly in the elderly and those with established HF).
• Pump failure: systolic and/or diastolic HF (see above), heart rate (eg -blockers,
heart block, post MI), negatively inotropic drugs (eg most antiarrhythmic agents).
• Chronic excessive afterload: eg aortic stenosis, hypertension.
Excessive preload can cause ventricular dilatation, this exacerbates pump failure.
Excessive afterload prompts ventricular muscle thickening (ventricular hypertro-
phy), resulting in stiff walls and diastolic dysfunction.
High-output heart failure: This is rare. Here, output is normal or increased in the
face of needs. Failure occurs when cardiac output fails to meet these needs. It will
occur with a normal heart, but even earlier if there is heart disease. Causes: anaemia,
pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, Paget’s disease, arteriovenous malformation, beriberi.
Consequences: initially features of RVF; later LVF becomes evident.
Diagnosis Requires symptoms of failure (see above) and objective evidence of car-
diac dysfunction at rest. For CCF, use the Framingham criteria. 35
Signs As described previously plus cyanosis, BP, narrow pulse pressure, pulsus al-
ternans, displaced apex (LV dilatation), RV heave (pulmonary hypertension), signs of
valve diseases. Severity can be graded using the New York classifi cation (see BOX).
Investigations According to NICE, 33 if ECG and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; p137)
are normal, heart failure is unlikely, and an alternative diagnosis should be consid-
ered; if either is abnormal, then echocardiography (p110) is required.
Tests FBC; U&E; BNP; CXR (see fi g 3.38); ECG; echo. ECG may indicate cause (look for
evidence of ischaemia, MI, or ventricular hypertrophy). It is rare to get a completely
normal ECG in chronic heart failure. Echocardiography is the key investigation. 36 It
may indicate the cause (MI, valvular heart disease) and can confi rm the presence or
absence of LV dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely needed.
Prognosis Poor with ~25–50% of patients dying within 5yrs of diagnosis. If admis-
sion is needed, 5yr mortality ≈75%. Be realistic: in one study, 54% of those dying in
the next 72h had been expected to live for >6months.37

Heart failure—management
Acute heart failure This is a medical emergency (p800).
Chronic heart failure Stop smoking. Stop drinking alcohol. Eat less salt. Optimize
weight & nutrition.33
• Treat the cause (eg if dysrhythmias; valve disease).
• Treat exacerbating factors (anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, BP).
• Avoid exacerbating factors, eg NSAIDS (fl uid retention) and verapamil (Ωve inotrope).
• Annual ’fl u vaccine, one-off pneumococcal vaccine.
• Drugs:
1 Diuretics: Give loop diuretics to relieve symptoms, eg furosemide 40mg/24h
PO or bumetanide 1–2mg/24h PO. Increase dose as necessary. SE: K+, renal im-
pairment. Monitor U&E and add K+-sparing diuretic (eg spironolactone) if K+
<3.2mmol/L, predisposition to arrhythmias, concurrent digoxin therapy, or pre-
existing K+-losing conditions. If refractory oedema, consider adding a thiazide,
eg metolazone 5–20mg/24h PO. Diuretics improve symptoms but studies show-
ing mortality benefi t are lacking.
2 ACE-i: Consider in all those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD);
improves symptoms and prolongs life (see p114–5). If cough is a problem, an
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be substituted. SE: K+.
3 -blockers: (eg carvedilol) mortality in heart failure—benefi t additional to
those of ACE-i in patients with systolic dysfunction. 38 Use with caution: ‘start
low and go slow’; if in doubt seek specialist advice fi rst; wait ≥2weeks between
each dose increment. -blocker therapy in patients hospitalized with decom-
pensated heart failure is associated with lower post-discharge mortality risk
and improved treatment rates. 39
4 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: Spironolactone (25mg/24h PO)
mortality by 30% when added to conventional therapy. 40 Use in those still
symptomatic despite optimal therapy as listed previously, and in post-MI pa-
tients with LVSD. Spironolactone is K+-sparing, but there is little risk of signifi -
cant hyperkalaemia, even when given with ACE-i. Nevertheless, U&E should be
monitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alterna-
tive if spironolactone is not tolerated.
5 Digoxin: Helps symptoms even in those with sinus rhythm, and should be con-
sidered for patients with LVSD who have signs or symptoms of heart failure
while receiving standard therapy, including ACE-i and -blockers, or in patients
with AF. Dose example: 125mcg/24h PO if sinus rhythm. Monitor U&E; maintain K+
at 4–5mmol/L as K+ risks digoxin toxicity, and vice versa. Digoxin levels: p756.
Other inotropes are unhelpful in terms of outcome.
6 Vasodilators: The combination of hydralazine (SE: drug-induced lupus) and
isosorbide dinitrate should be used if intolerant of ACE-i and ARBS as it reduces
mortality. It also reduces mortality when added to standard therapy (including
ACE-i) in black patients with heart failure. 41
Intractable heart failure Reassess the cause. Are they taking the drugs?—at maxi-
mum dose? Switching furosemide to bumetanide (one 5mg tab≈200mg furos emide)
might help. Inpatient management may include:
• Minimal exertion; Na+ & fl uid restriction (1.5L/24h PO).
• Metolazone (as above) and IV furosemide (p800).
• Opiates and IV nitrates may relieve symptoms (p800).
• Weigh daily. Do frequent U&E (beware K+).
• Give DVT prophylaxis: heparin + TED stockings (p578).
In extremis: Try IV inotropes (p802; it may be diffi cult to wean patients off them).
Consider: Cardiac resynchronization (p132), LV assist device (BOX ‘Pulseless pa-
tients’), or transplantation.
Palliative care Treat/prevent comorbidities (eg ’fl u vaccination). Good nutrition
(allow alcohol!). Involve GP: continuity of care and discussion of prognosis is much
apprec i ated. 42 Dyspnoea, pain (from liver capsule stretching), nausea, constipation,
and mood all need tackling. 43 Opiates improve pain and dyspnoea. O2 may help.

Pulseless patients
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used as bridging therapies
for patients awaiting heart transplantation (fi g 3.39). An internalized pump forces
blood through tubing from the left ventricle to the aorta. To power the pump, the
patient attaches the device to the mains electricity, and uses batteries when out
and about. Patients with continuous (rather than pulsatile) fl ow LVADs have no
pulse (fi g 3.39c) and ascultation will reveal a loud, continuous, mechanical hum. If
the patient collapses and there is no hum, resuscitation should include checking
the LVAD power supply!

Natriuretic peptides
Secretory granules have long been known to exist in the atria, and if hom ogenized
atrial tissue is injected into rats, their urine volume (and Na+ excretion) rises; this
is because of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). BNP is a similar hormone originally
identifi ed from pig brain (hence the B), but most BNP is secreted from ventricular
myocardium. Plasma BNP is closely related to LV pressure and in MI and LV dys-
function, these hormones can be released in large quantities. Secretion is also
increased by tachycardia, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormones.
Role: ANP and BNP assist the stretched atria and ventricles by increasing GFR and
decreasing renal Na+ resorption, thereby reducing fl uid load; and by relaxing
smooth muscle, thereby decreasing preload.
BNP as a biomarker of heart failure: BNP distinguishes heart failure from other
causes of dyspnoea more accurately than other biomarkers and LV ejection frac-
tion (sensitivity: >90%; specifi city: 80–90%). The rises are greater with left than
right heart failure and with systolic than diastolic dysfunction.
What BNP threshold for diagnosing heart failure: If BNP >100ng/L, this ‘diag-
noses’ heart failure better than other clinical variables or clinical judgement (his-
tory, examination, and CXR). BNP can be used to ‘rule out’ heart failure if <50ng/L. A
BNP >50ng/L does not exclude other coexisting diseases; conditions that can cause
BNP rises include tachycardia, cardiac ischaemia, COPD, PE, renal disease, sepsis, he-
patic cirrhosis, diabetes, and old age. Also, assays vary, so liaise with your lab.
Prognosis in heart failure: The higher the BNP, the higher the cardiovascular and
all-cause mortality (independent of age, NYHA class, previous MI, and LV ejection
fraction) and the greater the risk of sudden death. So, a patient whose symptoms
are currently well controlled may benefi t from more aggressive treatment if their
BNP if persistently raised.

Hypertension
Hypertension 44 is the most important risk factor for premature death and CVD; caus-
ing ~50% of all vascular deaths (8≈106/yr). Usually asymptomatic, so regular screen-
ing (eg 3-yrly) is a vital task—most preventable deaths are in areas without universal
screening. 45
Defi ning hypertension BP has a skewed normal distribution (p751) within the popu-
lation, and risk is continuously related to BP, so it is impo ssible to defi ne ‘hyperten-
sion’. 46 We choose to select a value above which risk is signifi cantly increased and
the benefi t of treatment is clear cut, see below. Don’t rely on a single reading—assess
over a period of time (how long depends on the BP and the presence of other risk
factors or end-organ damage). Confi rm with 24hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM);
or a week of home readings. NB: the diagnostic threshold is lower ~135/85mmHg.
Whom to treat All with BP ≥160/100mmHg (or ABPM ≥150/95mmHg). For those
≥140/90, the decision depends on the risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes,
or end-organ damage; see fi g 3.40. 44 The HYVET study showed that there is even sub-
stantial benefi t in treating the over-80s. 47 Lower thresholds may be appropriate for
young people—BP is on average lower in young people (eg 100–110/60–70 in 18-year-
olds) and they have a ‘lifetime’ of risk ahead of them; but evidence to treat is lacking.
White-coat hypertension Refers to an elevated clinic pressure, but normal ABPM
(day average <135/85). NICE says don’t treat; but more likely to develop hypertension
in future, and may have risk of CVD. Masked hypertension is the opposite.
‘Malignant’ or accelerated phase hypertension: A rapid rise in BP leading to vas-
cular damage (pathological hallmark is fi brinoid necrosis). Usually there is severe
hypertension (eg systolic >200, diastolic>130mmHg) + bilateral retinal haemorrhages
and exudates; papilloedema may or may not be present. Symptoms are common,
eg headache ± visual disturbance. It requires urgent treatment, and may also pre-
cipitate acute kidney injury, heart failure, or encephalopathy, which are hypertensive
emergencies. Untreated, 90% die in 1yr; treated, 70% survive 5yrs. It is more com-
mon in younger and in black subjects. Look hard for any underlying cause.
Primary or ‘essential’ hypertension: (Cause unknown.) ~95% of cases.
Secondary hypertension: ~5% of cases. Causes include:
• Renal disease: the most common secondary cause. 75% are from intrinsic renal
disease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic
pyelonephritis, or polycystic kidneys. 25% are due to renovascular disease, most
frequently atheromatous (elderly  cigarette smokers, eg with peripheral vascular
disease) or rarely fi bromuscular dysplasia (young ).
• Endocrine disease: Cushing’s (p224) and Conn’s syndromes (p228), phaeochromo-
cytoma (p228), acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism.
• Others: coarctation (p156), pregnancy (OHCS p48), liquorice, drugs: steroids, MAOI,
oral contraceptive pill, cocaine, amphetamines.
Signs and symptoms Usually asymptomatic (except malignant hypertension, see
earlier in topic). Headache is no more common than in the general population. Al-
ways examine the CVS fully and check for retinopathy. Are there features of an un-
derlying cause (phaeochromocytoma, p228, etc.), signs of renal disease, radiofemoral
delay, or weak femoral pulses (coarctation), renal bruits, palpable kidneys, or Cush-
ing’s syndrome? Look for end-organ damage: LVH, retinopathy and proteinuria—indi-
cates severity and duration of hypertension and associated with a poorer prognosis.
Tests To confi rm diagnosis: ABPM or home BP monitoring. To help quantify overall
risk: Fasting glucose; cholesterol. To look for end-organ damage: ECG or echo (any
LV hypertrophy? past MI?); urine analysis (protein, blood). To ‘exclude’ secondary
causes: U&E (eg K+ in Conn’s); Ca2+ ( in hyperparathyroidism). Special tests: Re-
nal ultrasound/arteriography (renal artery stenosis); 24h urinary meta-adrenaline
(p228); urinary free cortisol (p225); renin; aldosterone; MR aorta (coarctation).

Grading hypertensive retinopathy
1 Tortuous arteries with thick shiny walls (silver or copper wiring, p560, fi g 12.18).
2 AV nipping (narrowing where arteries cross veins, p560, fi g 12.19).
3 Flame haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots.
4 Papilloedema, p560, fi g 12.20.
Measuring BP with a sphygmomanometer
• Use the correct size cuff . The cuff width should be >40% of the arm circum-
ference. The bladder should be centred over the brachial artery, and the cuff
applied snugly. Support the arm in a horizontal position at mid-sternal level.
• Infl ate the cuff while palpating the brachial artery, until the pulse disappears.
This provides an estimate of systolic pressure.
• Infl ate the cuff until 30mmHg above systolic pressure, then place stethoscope
over the brachial artery. Defl ate the cuff at 2mmHg/s.
• Systolic pressure: appearance of sustained repetitive tapping sounds (Korotkoff I).
• Diastolic pressure: usually the disappearance of sounds (Korotkoff V). However,
in some individuals (eg pregnant women) sounds are present until the zero point.
In this case, the muffl ing of sounds, Korotkoff IV, should be used. State which is
used for a given reading. For children, see OHCS p157.

vices see http://www.bhsoc.org/latest-guidelines/how-to-measure-blood-pressure/

Hypertension—management
Look for and treat underlying causes (eg renal disease, alcohol: see p138). Drug
therapy reduces the risk of CVD and death. Almost any adult over 50 would benefi t
from antihypertensives, whatever their starting BP. 48 Treatment is especially impor-
tant if: BP is persistently ≥160/100mmHg or cardio vascular risk  (10yr risk of vascular
disease ≥20%), or existing vascular disease or target organ damage (eg brain, kidney,
heart, retina) with BP >140/90mmHg. Essential hypertension is not ‘curable’ and long-
term treatment is needed.
Treatment goal <140/90mmHg (<130/80 in diabetes, 150/90 if aged >80). Reduce
blood pressure slowly; rapid reduction can be fatal, especially in the context of an
acute stroke. These may fall—SPRINT49 showed a target of 120/80 was benefi cial.
Lifestyle changes Concomitant risk factors: stop smoking; low-fat diet. Reduce
alcohol and salt intake; increase exercise; reduce weight if obese.
Drugs The ALLHAT study suggests that adequate BP reduction is more important than
the specifi c drug used. 50 However, -blockers seem to be less eff ective than other
drugs at reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. -blockers and
thiazides may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, Ca2+-channel blockers appear
neutral, and ACE-i or ARB may reduce the risk. 44
Monotherapy: If ≥55yrs, and in black patients of any age, 1st choice is a Ca2+-channel
antagonist or thiazide. If <55, 1st choice is ACE-i (or ARB if ACE-i intolerant, eg cough).
-blockers are not 1st line for hypertension, but consider in younger people, particu-
larly if: intolerance or contraindication to ACE-i/ARB, she is a woman of child-bearing
potential, or there is sympathetic drive.
Combination : ACE-i + Ca2+-channel antagonist or diuretic is logical, and has been
commonly used in trials. There is little evidence on using 3 drugs but current recom-
mendation is ACE-i, Ca2+-channel antagonist, and thiazide.44 If BP still uncontrolled
on adequate doses of 3 drugs, add a 4th—consider: spironolactone 25–50mg/24h or
higher-dose thiazide, but monitor U&E. Alternatively, -blocker, or selective -blocker
and get help. Check compliance (urinary drug screen, or observed ).
Drug examples Thiazides: Eg chlortalidone 25–50mg/24h PO mané. SE: K+, Na+,
impotence. CI: gout. Ca2+-channel antagonists: Eg nifedipine MR, 30–60mg/24h PO.
SE: fl ushes, fatigue, gum hyperplasia, ankle oedema; avoid short-acting form. ACE-i:
Eg lisinopril 10–40mg/24h PO (max 40mg/d). ACE-i may be 1st choice if co-existing LVF,
or in diabetics (esp. if microalbuminuria, p314) or proteinuria. SE: cough, K+, renal
failure, angio-oedema. CI: bilateral renal artery or aortic valve stenosis; p114. ARB:
Candesartan (8–32mg/d); caution if valve disease or cardiomyopathy; monitor K+.
SE: vertigo, urticaria, pruritus. Useful if ACE-i induces cough. -blockers: Eg biso-
prolol 2.5–5mg/24h PO. SE: bronchospasm, heart failure, cold peripheries, lethargy,
impotence. CI: asthma; caution in heart failure. Consider aspirin when BP controlled,
if aged >55yrs. Add a statin if cholesterol raised. Most drugs take 4–8wks to gain
maximum eff ect: don’t assess effi cacy with just one BP measurement.
Malignant hypertension (fi g 3.41) In general, use oral therapy, unless there is
encephal opathy or CCF. The aim is for a controlled reduction in BP over days, not
hours. Avoid sudden drops in BP as cerebral autoregulation is poor (stroke risk).
Bed rest; there is no ideal hypotensive, but atenolol or long-acting Ca2+ blockers may
be used PO.
Encephalopathy: (Headache, focal CNS signs, seizures, coma.) Aim to reduce BP
to ~110mmHg diastolic over 4h. Admit to monitored area. Insert intra-arterial line
for pressure monitoring. Either IV labetalol (eg 50mg IV over 1min, repeated every
5min, max 200mg) or sodium nitroprusside infusion (0.5mcg/kg/min IVI titrated up
to 8mcg/kg/min, eg 50mg in 1L glucose 5%; expect to give 100–200mL/h for a few
hours only, to avoid cyanide risk).
Never use sublingual nifedipine to reduce BP (rapid drop in BP may cause stroke ). 51

Rheumatic fever (RF)
This systemic infection is still common in developing countries but increasingly rare
in the West. Peak incidence: 5–15yrs. Tends to recur unless prevented. Pharyngeal
infection with Lancefi eld group A -haemolytic streptococci triggers rheumatic fe-
ver 2–4wks later, in the susceptible 2% of the population. An antibody to the car-
bohydrate cell wall of the streptococcus cross-reacts with valve tissue (antigenic
mimicry) and may cause permanent damage to the heart valves.
Diagnosis Use the revised Jones criteria (may be over-rigorous). There must be
evidence of recent strep infection plus 2 major criteria, or 1 major + 2 minor.
Evidence of group A -haemolytic streptococcal infection:
• Positive throat culture (usually negative by the time RF symptoms appear).
• Rapid streptococcal antigen test +ve.
• Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titre (eg anti-streptolysin O (ASO) or
DNase B titre).
• Recent scarlet fever.
Major criteria:
• Carditis: tachycardia, murmurs (mitral or aortic regurgitation, Carey Coombs’
murmur, p46), pericardial rub, CCF, cardiomegaly, conduction defects (45–70%). An
apical systolic murmur may be the only sign.52
• Arthritis: a migratory, ‘fl itting’ polyarthritis; usually aff ects larger joints (75%).
• Subcutaneous nodules: small, mobile, painless nodules on extensor surfaces of
joints and spine (2–20%).
• Erythema marginatum: (fi g 3.42) geographical-type rash with red, raised edges
and clear centre; occurs mainly on trunk, thighs and arms in 2–10% (p562).
• Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus’ dance): occurs late in 10%. Unilateral or bilateral
involuntary semi-purposeful movements. May be preceded by emotional lability
and uncharacteristic behaviour.
Minor criteria:
• Fever.
• Raised ESR or CRP.
• Arthralgia (but not if arthritis is one of the major criteria).
• Prolonged PR interval (but not if carditis is major criterion).
• Previous rheumatic fever.
Management
• Bed rest until CRP normal for 2wks (may be 3 months).
• Benzylpenicillin 0.6–1.2g IV stat, then phenoxymethylpenicillin 250–500mg 4 times daily
PO for 10 days (if allergic to penicillin, give erythromycin or azithromycin for 10 days).
• Analgesia for carditis/arthritis: aspirin 100mg/kg/d PO in divided doses (max 4–8g/d)
for 2d, then 70mg/kg/d for 6wks. Monitor salicylate level. Toxicity causes tinnitus,
hyperventilation, and metabolic acidosis. Risk of Reye syndrome in children. Alterna-
tive: NSAIDS (p546). If moderate-to-severe carditis is present (cardiomegaly, CCF, or
3rd-degree heart block), add oral prednisolone to salicylate therapy. In case of heart
failure, treat appropriately (p136), with severe valve disease, surgery may be required.
• Immobilize joints in severe arthritis.
• Haloperidol (0.5mg/8h PO) or diazepam for the chorea.
Prognosis 60% with carditis develop chronic rheumatic heart disease. This cor-
relates with the severity of the carditis. 53 Acute attacks last an average of 3 months.
Recurrence may be precipitated by further streptococcal infections, pregnancy, or
use of the oral contraceptive pill. Cardiac sequelae aff ect mitral (70%), aortic (40%),
tricuspid (10%), and pulmonary (2%) valves. Incompetent lesions develop during the
attack, stenoses years later.
Secondary prophylaxis Penicillin V 250mg/12h PO. Alternatives: sulfadiazine 1g dai-
ly (0.5g if <30kg) or erythromycin 250mg twice daily (if penicillin allergic). Duration:
If carditis+persistent valvular disease, continue at least until age of 40 (sometimes
lifelong). If carditis but no valvular disease, continue for 10yrs. If there is no carditis,
5yrs of prophylaxis (until age of 21) is suffi cient.

Mitral valve disease
Mitral regurgitation (MR) Backfl ow through the mitral valve during systole.
Causes: Functional (LV dilatation); annular calcifi cation (elderly); rheumatic fever;
infective endocarditis; mitral valve prolapse; ruptured chordae tendinae; papillary
muscle dysfunction/rupture (eg post-MI); connective tissue disorders (Ehlers–Danlos,
Marfan’s); cardiomyopathy; congenital (may be associated with other defects, eg ASD,
AV canal); appetite suppressants (eg fenfl uramine, phentermine).
Symptoms: Dyspnoea; fatigue; palpitations; symptoms of causative factor (eg fever).
Signs: AF; displaced, hyperdynamic apex; pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to
axilla; soft S1; split S2; loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension). Severity: the more severe,
the larger the left ventricle.
Tests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale if in sinus rhythm (may mean left atrial size); LVH. CXR: big LA
& LV; mitral valve calcifi cation; pulmonary oedema.
Echocardiogram: To assess LV function and MR severity and aetiology (transoesoph-
ageal to assess severity and suitability for repair rather than replacement). Cardiac
catheterization to confi rm diagnosis, exclude other valve disease, and assess coro-
nary artery disease (can combine CABG with valve surgery).
Management: Control rate if fast AF. Anticoagulate if: AF; history of embolism; pros-
thetic valve; additional mitral stenosis. Diuretics improve symptoms. Surgery4 for
deteriorating symptoms; aim to repair or replace the valve before LV is irreversibly
impaired.
Mitral valve prolapse: Is the most common valvular abnormality (prevalence: ~5%).
Occurs alone or with: ASD, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Turner’s syn-
drome, Marfan’s syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
WPW (p133). Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. May develop atypical chest pain,
palpitations, and autonomic dysfunction symptoms. Signs: Mid-systolic click and/
or a late systolic murmur. Complications: MR, cerebral emboli, arrhythmias, sud-
den death. Tests: Echo is diagnostic. ECG may show inferior T-wave inversion. :
-blockers may help palpit ations and chest pain. Surgery if severe MR.
Mitral stenosis Causes: Rheumatic fever, congenital, mucopolysaccharidoses,
endo cardial fi broelastosis, malignant carcinoid (p271; rare), prosthetic valve.
Presentation: Normal mitral valve orifi ce area is ~4–6cm2. Symptoms usually be-
gin when the orifi ce becomes <2cm2. Pulmonary hypertension causes dyspnoea,
haemoptysis, chronic bronchitis-like picture; pressure from large left atrium on local
structures causes hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia (oesophagus),
bronchial obstruction; also fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, systemic emboli, infec-
tive endocarditis (rare).
Signs: Malar fl ush on cheeks (due to cardiac output); low-volume pulse; AF common
(due to enlarged LA); tapping, non-displaced, apex beat (palpable S1); RV heave. On
auscultation: loud S1; opening snap (pliable valve); rumbling mid-diastolic murmur
(heard best in expiration, with patient on left side). Graham Steell murmur (p46) may
occur. Severity: the more severe the stenosis, the longer the diastolic murmur, and
the closer the opening snap is to S2.
Tests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale; RVH; progressive RAD. CXR: left atrial enlargement (double
shadow in right cardiac silhouette); pulmonary oedema; mitral valve calcifi cation.
Echo is diagnostic. Signifi cant stenosis exists if the valve orifi ce is <1cm2/m2 body
surface area. Indications for cardiac catheterization: previous valvotomy; signs of
other valve disease; angina; severe pulmonary hypertension; calcifi ed mitral valve.
Management: If in AF, rate control (p130) is crucial; anticoagulate with warfarin
(p350). Diuretics  preload and pulmonary venous congestion. If this fails to control
symptoms, balloon valvuloplasty (if pliable, non-calcifi ed valve), open mitral valvot-
omy, or valve replacement.
4 In patients with severe symptoms for whom open surgery is too dangerous, consider transcatheter valve
repair, eg with MitraClip®. This is only available in specialist centres.

What Becomes of the Broken Hearted?
‘For who loveth extreamely, and feeleth not that passion to dissolve his hearte?
Who rejoyceth, and proveth not his heart dilated?
Who is moyled with heavinesse, or plunged with payne,
and perceiveth not his heart to bee coarcted?
Whom infl ameth ire, and hath not heart-burning?
By these experiences, wee prove in our hearts the working of Passions,
and by the noyse of their tumult, wee understand the woorke of their presence’
Thomas Wright, The Passions of the Minde in Generall, 1604
From Aztec priests raising beating human hearts to the Sun-God, to heart meta-
phors in song lyrics today, ideas of links between the heart and human psychoso-
cial self/soul/experience-of-being have pervaded the imaginative landscapes of
cultures throughout time and place.
Some of these links relate to physiological changes associated with emotion-trig-
gered adrenaline surges—‘my heart raced’, for example, is a phrase we relate to
both physically and emotionally. Other heart-phrases result from poetic extrapola-
tions of heart/self ideas and have no physiological explanation, eg ‘he wears his
heart on his sleeve’.
Evidence is building that heart/self interactions exist beyond metaphor and symp-
tomatic ‘fl ight-or-fi ght’ responses. Aff ective disorders, certain personality types,
and traumatic life-experiences increase the risk of cardiac disease, even when life-
style factors are controlled for.54–56 In ‘broken heart syndrome’ (Takotsubo cardio-
myopathy), ventricular contraction morphology changes in response to emotional
or physical stress (fi g 3.43). It mimics a myocardial infarction in terms of clinical
history, ECG changes, and troponin rises, but the prognosis and management may
be quite diff erent so accurate diagnosis is important.
As physicians, we often focus on explainable physical aspects of disease, but the
physical and psychosocial are inconveniently related and both should be assessed
to determine best management. Should an IHD suff erer be off ered CBT alongside
their statins? Could a grieving patient’s ‘MI’ be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy? To an-
swer these questions we must look beyond ECGs and troponin, to the ‘heart-ache’
of the literary and philosophical kinds.

Fig 3.43 (a) Left ventriculogram of a heart in diastole. (b) The same patient’s heart in systole.
The apex is ballooning whilst the base contracts, causing ineffi cient pumping and a risk of rup-
ture. This pattern is classic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Aortic valve disease
Aortic stenosis (AS) Causes: Senile calcifi cation is the commonest. 57 Others: con-
genital (bicuspid valve, Williams syndrome, p149), rheumatic heart disease.
Presentation: Think of AS in any elderly person with chest pain, exertional dysp-
noea, or syncope. The classic triad includes angina, syncope, and heart failure. Also:
dyspnoea; dizziness; faints; systemic emboli if infective endocarditis; sudden death.
Signs: Slow rising pulse with narrow pulse pressure (feel for diminished and delayed
carotid upstroke—parvus et tardus); heaving, non-displaced apex beat; LV heave;
aortic thrill; ejection systolic murmur (heard at the base, left sternal edge and the
aortic area, radiates to the carotids). S1 is usually normal. As stenosis worsens, A2 is
increasingly delayed, giving fi rst a single S2 and then reversed splitting. But this sign
is rare. More common is a quiet A2. In severe AS, A2 may be inaudible (calcifi ed valve).
There may be an ejection click (pliable valve) or an S4.
Tests: ECG: LVH with strain pattern; P-mitrale; LAD; poor R-wave progression; LBBB
or complete AV block (calcifi ed ring). CXR: LVH; calcifi ed aortic valve (fi g 3.44); post-
stenotic dilatation of ascending aorta. Echo: diagnostic (p110). Doppler echo can
estimate the gradient across valves: severe stenosis if peak gradient 40mmHg (but
beware the poor left ventricle not able to generate gradient) and valve area <1cm2.
If the aortic jet velocity is >4m/s (or is increasing by >0.3m/s per yr) risk of complica-
tions is increased. 57 Cardiac catheter can assess: valve gradient; LV function; coronary
artery disease; risks: emboli generation.
Differential diagnosis: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, p152); aortic sclerosis.
Management: If symptomatic, prognosis is poor without surgery: 2–3yr survival if
angina/syncope; 1–2yr if cardiac failure. If moderate-to-severe and treated medi-
cally, mortality can be as high as 50% at 2yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement
(p148) is usually recommended. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and a dete-
riorating ECG, valve replacement is also recommended. If the patient is not medically
fi t for surgery, percutaneous valvuloplasty/replacement (TAVI = transcatheter aortic
valve implantation) may be attempted (fi g 3.45).
Aortic sclerosis Senile degeneration of the valve. There is an ejection systolic mur-
mur; but no carotid radiation, and normal pulse (character and volume) and S2.
Aortic regurgitation (AR) Acute: Infective endocarditis, ascending aortic dis-
section, chest trauma. Chronic: Congenital, connective tissue disorders (Marfan’s
syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos), rheumatic fever, Takayasu arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
SLE, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, appetite suppressants (eg fenfl uramine, phenter-
mine), seronegative arthritides (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter’s syndrome, psor iatic
arthropathy), hypert ension, osteogenesis imperfecta, syphilitic aortitis.
Symptoms: Exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and PND. Also: palpitations, angina,
syncope, CCF. Signs: Collapsing (water-hammer) pulse (p42); wide pulse pressure;
displaced, hyperdynamic apex beat; high-pitc hed early diastolic murmur (heard best
in expiration, with patient sat forward). Eponyms: Corrigan’s sign: carotid pulsation;
de Musset’s sign: head nodding with each heart beat; Quincke’s sign: capillary pulsa-
tions in nail beds; Duroziez’s sign: in the groin, a fi nger compressing the femoral ar-
tery 2cm proximal to the stethoscope gives a systolic murmur; if 2cm distal, it gives
a diastolic murmur as blood fl ows backwards; Traube’s sign: ‘pistol shot’ sound over
femoral arteries; an Austin Flint murmur (p46) denotes severe AR.
Tests: ECG: LVH. CXR: cardiomegaly; dilated ascending aorta; pulmonary oedema. Echo
is diagnostic. Cardiac catheterization to assess: severity of lesion; anatomy of aortic
root; LV function; coronary artery disease; other valve disease.
Management: The main goal of medical therapy is to reduce systolic hypertension;
ACE-i are helpful. Echo every 6–12 months to monitor. Indications for surgery: severe
AR with enlarged ascending aorta, increasing symptoms, enlarging LV or deterio-
rating LV function on echo; or infective endocarditis refractory to medical therapy.
Aim to replace the valve before signifi cant LV dysfunction occurs. Predictors of poor
post-operative survival: ejection fraction <50%, NYHA class III or IV (p135), duration
of CCF >12 months.

transcatheter aortic valve implants: animal
valve leafl ets mounted on metal stents. This ex-
traordinary stucture must be resilient against the

of blood; it must avoid obstructing forward fl ow
of blood whilst providing a near-complete block to
backfl ow; and it has surfaces of foreign material yet
must avoid triggering clots or allowing microbial
growth. On top of this, it must be able to fold down
over a wire to allow safe passage through the ar-
terial tree from the groin to the heart, before being
opened out by an infl ated balloon.

Right heart valve disease
Tricuspid regurgitation Causes: Functional (RV dilatation; eg due to pulmonary
hypertension induced by LV failure or PE); rheumatic fever; infective endocarditis (IV
drug abuser5); carcinoid syndrome; congenital (eg ASD, AV canal, Ebstein’s anomaly
(downward displacement of the tricuspid valve—see OHCS p642)); drugs (eg ergot-
derived dopamine agonists, p495; fenfl uramine). Symptoms: Fatigue; hepatic pain
on exertion (due to hepatic congestion); ascites; oedema and symptoms of the
causative condition. Signs: Giant v waves and prominent y descent in JVP (p43); RV
heave; pansystolic murmur, heard best at lower sternal edge in inspiration; pulsatile
hepatomegaly; jaundice; ascites. Management: Drugs: diuretics for systemic con-
gestion; drugs to treat underlying cause. Valve repair or replacement (~10% 30-day
mortality). Tricuspid regurgitation resulting from myocardial dysfunction or dilata-
tion has a mortality of up to 50% at 5 yrs.
Tricuspid stenosis Causes: Main cause is rheumatic fever, which almost always
occurs with mitral or aortic valve disease. Also: congenital, infective endocarditis.
Symptoms: Fatigue, ascites, oedema. Signs: Giant a wave and slow y descent in
JVP (p43); opening snap, early diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal edge in
inspiration. AF can also occur. Diagnosis: Echo. Treatment: Diuretics; surgical repair.
Pulmonary stenosis Causes: Usually congenital (Turner syndrome, Noonan syn-
drome, Williams syndrome, Fallot’s tetralogy, rubella). Acquired causes: rheumatic
fever, carcinoid syndrome. Symptoms: Dyspnoea; fatigue; oedema; ascites. Signs: Dys-
morphic facies (congenital causes); prominent a wave in JVP; RV heave. In mild stenosis,
there is an ejection click, ejection systolic murmur (which radiates to the left shoulder);
widely split S2. In severe stenosis, the murmur becomes longer and obscures A2. P2
becomes softer and may be inaudible. Tests: ECG: RAD, P-pulmonale, RVH, RBBB; echo/TOE
(p110); CXR: prominent pulmonary arteries caused by post-stenotic dilatation. Cardiac
catheterization is diagnostic. Treatment: Pulmonary valvuloplasty or valvotomy.
Pulmonary regurgitation Causes: Any cause of pulmonary hypertension (p194).
Signs: Decrescendo murmur in early diastole at the left sternal edge (the Graham
Steell murmur if associated with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension).
Cardiac surgery
Cardiac surgery has come on a long way since 1923 when Dr Henry Souttar58,59 used
his fi nger to open a stenosed mitral valve in a beating heart.6 Cardiac bypass allows
prolonged access to the open, static heart, during which complex and high-precision
repair and replacement of valves and aortic roots can occur. Transcatheter proce-
dures are playing an increasing role in the management of cardiovascular disease.
Key open heart procedures include:
Valve replacements Mechanical valves may be of the ball-cage (Starr–Edwards),
tilting disc (Bjork–Shiley), or double tilting disc (St Jude) type. These valves are very
durable but the risk of thromboembolism is high; patients require lifelong anticoagu-
lation. Xenografts are made from porcine valves or pericardium. These valves are
less durable and may require replacement at 8–10yrs but have the advantage of not
necessitating anticoagulation. Homografts are cadaveric valves. They are particu-
larly useful in young patients and in the replacement of infected valves. Complica-
tions of prosthetic valves: systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, haemolysis,
structural valve failure, arrhythmias.
CABG See p123.
Cardiac transplantation Consider this when cardiac disease is severely curtailing
quality of life, and survival is not expected beyond 6–12 months.
Surgery for congenital heart defects See p156.
Aortic root surgery Replacement/repair if dissection or aneurysmal.
5 Remember that it is the tricuspid valve which is the valve most vulnerable to events arriving by vein, eg
pathogens from IV drug abusers or hormones (particularly 5-HT) from carcinoid tumours.

of mitral stenosis. BMJ 1925: 2(3379): 603–606.

Infective endocarditis (IE)
Fever + new murmur = endocarditis until proven otherwise. Any fever lasting >1wk in
those known to be at risk7 must prompt blood cultures.61 Acute infective endocarditis
(IE) tends to occur on ‘normal’ valves and may present with acute heart failure ± emboli;
the commonest organism is Staph. aureus. Risk factors: skin breaches (dermatitis, IV
lines, wounds); renal failure; immunosuppression; DM. Mortality: 5–50% (related to age
and embolic events). Endocarditis on abnormal valves tends to run a subacute course.
Risk factors: aortic or mitral valve disease; tricuspid valves in IV drug users; coarctation;
patent ductus arteriosus; VSD; prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on prosthetic valves may
be ‘early’ (within 60d of surgery, usually Staph. epidermidis, poor prognosis) or ‘late’.
Causes Bacteria: Bacteraemia occurs all the time, eg when we chew (not just during
dentistry or medical interventions—which is why routine prophylaxis for such pro-
cedures does not make sense). 61 Strep. viridans is the commonest (usually subacute)
followed by Staph. aureus, Strep. bovis (need colonoscopy ?tumour), Enterococci
and Coxiella burnetii. Rarely: HACEK Gram Ωve bacteria (Haemoph ilus–Actinobacil-
lus–Cardiobacte rium–Eikenella–Kingella); diphtheroids; Chlamydia. Fungi: Candida;
Aspergillus; Histoplasma. Usually in IV drug abusers, immunocompromised patients
or those with prosthetic valves. High mortality, need surgical management. Other:
SLE (Libman–Sacks endocarditis); malignancy.
Signs Septic signs: Fever, rigors, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, anaemia,
spleno meg aly, and clubbing (fi g 3.46). Cardiac lesions: Any new murmur, or a
change in pre-existing murmur, should raise the suspicion of endocarditis. Vegeta-
tions may cause valve destruction and severe regurgitation, or valve obstruction. An
aortic root abscess causes prolongation of the PR interval, and may lead to complete
AV block. LVF is a common cause of death. Immune complex deposition: Vasculitis
(p556) may aff ect any vessel. Microscopic haematuria is common; glomerulonephri-
tis and acute kidney injury may occur. Roth spots (boat-shaped retinal haemorrhage
with pale centre); splinter haemorrhages (fi g 3.47); Osler’s nodes (painful pulp in-
farcts in fi ngers or toes). Embolic phenomena: Emboli may cause abscesses in the
relevant organ, eg brain, heart, kidney, spleen, gut (or lung if right-sided IE) or skin:
termed Janeway lesions (fi g 3.48; painless palmar or plantar macules), which, to-
gether with Osler’s nodes, are pathognomonic.
Diagnosis Use the Modifi ed Duke criteria (BOX ‘Modified Duke criteria’).62, 63 Blood
cultures: Do three sets at diff erent times from diff erent sites at peak of fever. 85–
90% are diagnosed from the 1st two sets; 10% are culture-negative. Blood tests:
Normochromic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP. Rheumatoid factor
positive (an immunological phenomenon). Also check U&E, Mg2+, LFT. Urinalysis: For
microscopic haematuria. CXR: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. Regular ECGs: To
look for heart block. Echocardiogram: TTE (p110) may show vegetations, but only if
>2mm. TOE (p110) is more sensitive, and better for visualizing mitral lesions and pos-
sible development of aortic root abscess. CT: To look for emboli (spleen, brain, etc.).
Treatment Liaise early with microbiologists and cardiologists.62 Antibiotics: see BOX
‘Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis’. Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular ob-
struction; repeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess;
unstable infected prosthetic valve. 64
Prognosis 50% require surgery. 20% inhospital mortality (Staphs 30%; bowel bac-
teria 14%; Streps 6%). 15% recurrence at 2yrs.
Prevention Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for those at risk of
IE undergoing invasive procedures. However, if they are given antibiotics for other
reasons during a procedure, the antibiotic should cover the common IE organisms.
Recommendations Give clear information about prevention, including:
• The importance of maintaining good oral health.
• Symptoms that may indicate IE and when to seek expert advice.
• The risks of invasive procedures, including non-medical procedures such as body
piercing or tattooing.65
7 Past IE or rheumatic fever; IV drug abuser; damaged or replaced valve; PPM or ICD; structural congenital
heart disease (but not simple ASD, fully repaired VSD, or patent ductus); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Modifi ed Duke criteria for infective endocarditis
Major criteria:
• Positive blood culture:
• Typical organism in 2 separate cultures or
• Persistently +ve blood cultures, eg 3 >12h apart (or majority if >3) or
• Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii.
• Endocardium involved:
• Positive echocardiogram (vegetation, abscess, pseudoaneurysm, dehiscence
of prosthetic valve) or
• Abnormal activity around prosthetic valve on PET/CT or SPECT/CT or
• Paravalvular lesions on cardiac CT.
Minor criteria:
• Predisposition (cardiac lesion; IV drug abuse).
• Fever >38°C.
• Vascular phenomena (emboli, Janeway’s lesions, etc.).
• Immunological phenomena (glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, etc.).
• Positive blood culture that does not meet major criteria.
How to diagnose: Defi nite infective endocarditis: 2 major or 1 major and 3 minor
or all 5 minor criteria.
Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis
Prescribe antibiotics for infective endocarditis as follows.66 For more information
on individual antibiotics, see tables 9.4–9.9, pp386–7.
• Blind therapy—native valve or prosthetic valve implanted >1y ago: ampicillin,
fl ucloxacillin and gentamicin. Vancomycin + gentamicin if penicillin-allergic. If
thought to be Gram Ωve: meropenem + vancomycin.
• Blind therapy—prosthetic valve: vancomycin + gentamicin + rifampicin.
• Staphs—native valve: fl ucloxacillin for >4wks. If allergic or MRSA: vancomycin .
• Staphs—prosthetic valves: fl ucloxacillin + rifampicin + gentamicin for 6wks (re-
view need for gentamicin after 2wks). If penicillin-allergic or MRSA: vancomycin
+ rifampicin + gentamicin.
• Streps—fully sensitive to penicillin: benzylpenicillin 1.2g/4h IV for 4–6wks.8
• Streps—less sensitive: benzylpenicillin + gentamicin; if penicillin allergic or highly
penicillin resistant: vancomycin + gentamicin.
• Enterococci: amoxicillin + gentamicin. If pen-allergic: vancomycin + gentamicin—
for 4wks (6wks if prosthetic valve); review need for gentamicin after 2wks.
• HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella,
Kingella): ceftriaxone for 4wks with native valve or 6wks with prosthetic.
• Fungal: Candida—amphotericin. Aspergillus—voriconazole.

Diseases of heart muscle
Acute myocarditis This is infl ammation of myocardium, often associated with
pericardial infl ammation (myopericarditis).67 Causes: See table 3.3. Symptoms and
signs: ACS-like symptoms, heart failure symptoms, palpitations, tachycardia, soft
S1, S4 gallop (p44).Tests: ECG: ST changes and T-wave inversion, atrial arrhythmias,
transient AV block, QT prolongation. Bloods: CRP, ESR, & troponin may be raised; viral
serology and tests for other likely causes. Echo: diastolic dysfunction, regional wall
abnormalities. Cardiac MR if clinically stable. Endomyocardial biopsy is gold stand-
ard. : Supportive. Treat the underlying cause. Treat arrhythmias and heart failure
(p136). NSAID use is controversial. Avoid exercise as this can precipitate arrhythmias.
Prognosis: 50% will recover within 4wks. 12–25% will develop DCM and severe heart
failure. DCM can occur years after apparent recovery.
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) A dilated, fl abby heart of unknown cause. Associa-
tions: alcohol, BP, chemotherapeutics, haemochromatosis, viral infection, autoim-
mune, peri- or postpartum, thyrotoxicosis, congenital (X-linked). Prevalence: 0.2%.
Presentation: Fatigue, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, RVF, emboli, AF, VT. Signs:
Pulse, BP, JVP, displaced and diff use apex, S3 gallop, mitral or tricuspid regurgita-
tion (MR/TR), pleural eff usion, oedema, jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites. Tests: Blood:
BNP (p137), Na+ indicates a poor prognosis. CXR: cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema.
ECG: tachycardia, non-specifi c T-wave changes, poor R-wave progression. Echo: glob-
ally dilated hypokinetic heart and low ejection fraction. Look for MR, TR, LV mural
thrombus. : Bed rest, diuretics, -blockers, ACE-i, anticoagu l ation, biventricular pac-
ing, ICDs, LVADs, transplantation. Mortality: Variable, eg 40% in 2yrs.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) LV outfl ow tract (LVOT) obstruction from
asymmetric septal hypertrophy. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death
in the young. Prevalence: 0.2%. Autosomal dominant inheritance, but 50% are spo-
radic. 70% have mutations in genes encoding -myosin, -tropomyosin, and troponin
T. May present at any age. Ask about family history of sudden death. Symptoms and
signs: Sudden death may be the fi rst manifestation of HCM in many patients (VF is
amenable to implantable defi brillators), angina, dyspnoea, palpitation, syncope, CCF.
Jerky pulse; a wave in JVP; double-apex beat; systolic thrill at lower left sternal edge;
harsh ejection systolic murmur. Tests: • ECG: LVH; progressive T-wave inversion; deep
Q waves (inferior + lateral leads); AF; WPW syndrome (p133); ventricular ectopics; VT.
• Echo: asymmetrical septal hypertrophy; small LV cavity with hypercontractile pos-
terior wall; midsystolic closure of aortic valve; systolic anterior movement of mitral
valve. • MRI: see fi g 3.16. • Cardiac catheterization helps assess: severity of gradient;
coronary artery disease or mitral regurgitation, but may provoke VT. • Electrophysi-
ological studies may be needed (eg if WPW, p133). • Exercise test ± Holter monitor
(p125) to risk stratify. : -blockers or verapamil for symptoms (the aim is reducing
ventricular contractility). Amiodarone (p130) for arrhythmias (AF, VT). Anticoagulate
for paroxysmal AF or systemic emboli. Septal myomectomy (surgical or chemical
(with alcohol) to LV outfl ow tract gradient) is reserved for those with severe symp-
toms. Consider implantable defi brillator—use http://www.doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html
to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Mortality: 5.9%/yr if <14yrs; 2.5%/yr if >14yrs.
Poor prognostic factors: age <14yrs or syncope at presentation; family history of
HCM/sudden death.
Restrictive cardiomyopathy Causes: Idiopathic; amyloidosis; haemochromato-
sis; sarcoido sis; scleroderma; Löffl er’s eosinophilic endocarditis; endomyocardial
fi brosis. Presentation: Is like constrictive pericarditis (p154). Features of RVF pre-
dominate: JVP, with prominent x and y descents; hepatomegaly; oedema; ascites.
Diagnosis: Echo, MRI, cardiac catheterization. : Treat the cause.
Cardiac myxoma (fi gs 3.49, 3.50) Rare benign cardiac tumour. Prevalence ≤5/10 000,
:≈2:1. Usually sporadic, but may be familial (Carney complex: cardiac and cutane-
ous myxomas, skin pigmentation, endocrinopathy, etc., p223). It may mimic infective
endocarditis (fever, weight loss, clubbing, ESR, systemic emboli), or mitral stenosis
(left atrial obstruction, AF). A ‘tumour plop’ may be heard, and signs may vary ac-
cording to posture. Tests: Echo. : Excision.

Pericardial diseases
Acute pericarditis This is infl ammation of the pericardium.68
Causes: Idiopathic or secondary to:
• Viruses: eg coxsackie, echovirus, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, mumps, varicella, HIV.
• Bacteria: eg TB—commonest cause worldwide, Lyme disease, Q fever, pneumonia,
rheumatic fever, Staphs, Streps, mycoplasma, legionella, MAI in HIV.
• Fungi and parasitic: v rare, usually in immunocompromised.
• Autoimmune: systemic autoimmune diseases eg SLE, RA; vasculitides eg Behçet,
Takayasu; IBD; sarcoid; amyloid; Dressler’s (p698).
• Drugs: eg procainamide, hydralazine, penicillin, isoniazid, chemotherapy.
• Metabolic: uraemia, hypothyroidism, anorexia nervosa.
• Others: trauma, surgery, malignancy, radiotherapy, MI, chronic heart failure.
Clinical features: Central chest pain worse on inspiration or lying fl at ± relief by
sitting forward. A pericardial friction rub (p46) may be heard. Look for evidence of
a pericardial eff usion or cardiac tamponade (see later in topic). Fever may occur.
Tests: ECG classically shows concave (saddle-shaped) ST segment elevation and PR
depression, but may be normal or non-specifi c (10%); see fi g 3.51. Blood tests: FBC,
ESR, U&E, cardiac enzymes (NB: troponin may be raised); tests relating to possible aeti-
ologies. Cardiomegaly on CXR may indicate a pericardial eff usion. Echo (if suspected
pericardial eff usion). CMR and CT may show localized infl ammation.
Treatment: NSAIDs or aspirin with gastric protection for 1–2weeks. Add colchicine
500mcg OD or BD for 3 months to reduce the risk of recurrence. Rest until symptoms
resolve. Treat the cause. If not improving or autoimmune, consider steroids (may
increase the risk of recurrence) or other immunosuppressive therapies.
Pericardial eff usion Accumulation of fl uid in the pericardial sac (normally 10–
50mL).68 Causes: Pericarditis, myocardial rupture (haemopericardium—surgical,
stab wound, post-MI); aortic dissection; pericardium fi lling with pus; malignancy.
Clinical features: Dyspnoea, chest pain, signs of local structures being compressed—
hiccoughs (phrenic N), nausea (diaphragm), bronchial breathing at left base (Ewart’s
sign: compressed left lower lobe). Muffl ed heart sounds. Look for signs of cardiac
tamponade (below).
Diagnosis: CXR shows an enlarged, globular heart if eff usion >300mL; fi g 3.14. ECG
shows low-voltage QRS complexes and may have alternating QRS morphologies (elec-
trical alternans). Echocardi ography shows an echo-free zone surrounding the heart.
Management: Treat the cause. Pericardiocentesis may be diagnostic (suspected
bacterial pericarditis) or therapeutic (cardiac tamponade). See p773. Send pericar-
dial fl uid for culture, ZN stain/TB culture, and cytology.
Constrictive pericarditis The heart is encased in a rigid pericardium.68
Causes: Often unknown (UK); elsewhere TB, or after any pericarditis.
Clinical features: These are mainly of right heart failure with JVP (with prominent
x and y descents, p43); Kussmaul’s sign (JVP rising paradoxically with inspiration);
soft, diff use apex beat; quiet heart sounds; S3; diastolic pericardial knock, hepato-
splenomegaly, ascites, and oedema.
Tests: CXR: small heart ± pericardial calcifi cation. CT/MRI—helps distinguish from re-
strictive cardiomyopathy. Echo. Cardiac catheterization.
Management: Surgical excision. Medical  to address the cause and symptoms.
Cardiac tamponade A pericardial eff usion that raises intrapericardial pressure,
reducing ventricular fi lling and thus dropping cardiac output.68  Can lead rapidly
to cardiac arrest.
Signs: Pulse, BP, pulsus paradoxus, JVP, Kussmaul’s sign, muffl ed S1 and S2.
Diagnosis: Beck’s triad: falling BP; rising JVP; muffl ed heart sounds. ECG: low-voltage
QRS ± electrical alternans. Echo is diagnostic: echo-free zone (>2cm, or >1cm if acute)
around the heart ± diastolic collapse of right atrium and right ventricle.
Management: Seek expert help. The pericardial eff usion needs urgent drainage
(p773). Send fl uid for culture, ZN stain/TB culture, and cytology.

Adult congenital heart disease (ACHD)
This is a growing area of cardiology as increasing numbers of children with congenital
heart defects survive to adulthood, sometimes as a result of complex restructuring
procedures which have their own physiological implications (see BOX ‘Patients with
one ventricle’). ACHD69 patients are at increased risk of many conditions described else-
where, for which many of the ‘standard’ investigations and therapies will apply: includ-
ing arrhythmias (p124), heart failure (p134), and infective endocarditis (p150).
Investigations Echocardiography (± bubble contrast) is fi rst line. Increasingly, car-
diac CT and MR are used to provide precise anatomical and functional information.
Cardiac catheterization generates data on oxygen saturation and pressure in diff er-
ent vessels and chambers. Exercise testing assesses functional capacity.
A few of the more common ACHDs are discussed below:
Bicuspid aortic valve These work well at birth and go undetected. Many even-
tually develop aortic stenosis (needing valve replacement) ± aortic regurgitation
predisposing to IE/SBE ± aortic dilatation/dissection. Intense exercise may accelerate
complications, so do yearly echocardiograms on aff ected athletes. 70
Atrial septal defect (ASD) A hole connects the atria.
• Ostium secundum defects: 80% cases; hole high in the septum; often asymptomat-
ic until adulthood when a LR shunt develops. Shunting depends on the compliance
of the ventricles. LV compliance decreases with age (esp. if BP), so augmenting LR
shunting; hence dyspnoea/heart failure, typically aged 40–60yrs.
• Ostium primum defects: associated with AV valve anomalies, eg in Down’s syn-
drome; present in childhood.
Signs and symptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea. Arrhythmias incl. AF; JVP;
wide, fi xed split S2; pulmonary systolic fl ow murmur. Pulmonary hypertension may
cause pulmonary or tricuspid regurgitation, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Frequency
of migraine. Simple tests: ECG: RBBB with LAD (primum defect) or RAD (secundum
defect). CXR: small aortic knuckle, pulmonary plethora, atrial enlargement. Com-
plications: • Reversal of left-to-right shunt, ie Eisen men ger’s complex: initial LR
shunt leads to pulmonary hypertension which increases right heart pressures until
they exceed left heart pressures, hence shunt reversal. This causes cyanosis as de-
oxygenated blood enters systemic circulation. • Paradoxical emboli eg causing CVAs
(veinartery via ASD; rare). Treatment: May close spontaenously. If not, primum de-
fects are usually closed in childhood. Secundum defects should be closed if sympto-
matic or signs of RV overload. Transcatheter closure is more common than surgical.
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) A hole connects the ventricles. Causes: Congenital
(prevalence 2:1000 births); acquired (post-MI). Symptoms: May present with severe
heart failure in infancy, or remain asymptomatic and be detected incidentally in
later life. Signs: Classically, a harsh pan systolic murmur is heard at the left sternal
edge, with a systolic thrill, ± left para sternal heave. Smaller holes, which are haemo-
dynamically less signifi cant, give louder murmurs. Signs of pulmonary hypertension.
Complications: AR, IE/SBE, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger’s complex (above),
heart failure from volume overload. Tests: ECG: normal, LAD, LVH, RVH. CXR: normal
heart size ± mild pulmonary plethora (small VSD) or cardiomegaly, large pulmonary
arteries and marked pulmonary plethora (large VSD). Cardiac catheter: step up in
O2 saturation in right ventricle. Treatment: Initially medical as many close sponta-
neously. Indications for surgical closure: failed medical therapy, symptomatic VSD,
shunt >3 : 1, SBE/IE. Endovascular closure may be possible. 71
Coarctation of the aorta Congenital narrowing of the descending aorta; usually
occurs just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. More common in boys.
Associations: Bicuspid aortic valve; Turner’s syndrome. Signs: Radiofemoral delay;
weak femoral pulse; BP; scapular bruit; systolic murmur (best heard over the left
scapula); cold feet. Complications: Heart failure from high afterload; IE; intracer-
ebral haemorrhage. Tests: CT or MRI-aortogram; CXR may show rib notching as blood
diverts down intercostal arteries to reach the lower body, causing these vessels to
dilate and erode local rib bone. Treatment: Surgery, or balloon dilatation ± stenting.
Tetralogy of Fallot See p157.

Fallot’s tetralogy: what the non-specialist needs to know
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disorder
(prevalence: 3–6 per 10 000). It is also the most common cyanotic heart defect that
survives to adulthood, accounting for 10% of all ACHD. 72 It is believed to be due to
abnormalities in separation of the truncus arteriosus into the aorta and pulmo-
nary arteries early in gestation (fi g 3.52).
The ‘tetralogy’ of features are:
1 Ventricular septal defect (VSD).
2 Pulmonary stenosis.
3 Right ventricular hypertrophy.
4 The aorta overrides the VSD, accepting right heart
blood.
A few patients also have an ASD, which makes up the
pentad of Fallot.
Presentation: Severity of illness depends greatly on
the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Infants may be
acyanotic at birth, with a pulmonary stenosis mur-
mur as the only initial fi nding. Gradually (especially
after closure of the ductus arteriosus) they become
cyanotic due to decreasing fl ow of blood to the lungs Fig 3.52 Tetralogy of Fallot.
and increasing right-to-left fl ow across the VSD. Dur- Reproduced from Thorne et al.,

as it increases peripheral vascular resistance, there-
by decreasing the degree of right to left shunt. Adult patients are often asymp-
tomatic. In the unoperated adult patient, cyanosis is common, although extreme
cyanosis or squatting is uncommon. In repaired patients, late symptoms include
exertional dyspnoea, palpitations, clubbing, RV failure, syncope, and even sudden
death. Investigations: ECG shows RV hypertrophy with a right bundle-branch
block. CXR may be normal, or show the hallmark of TOF, which is the classic boot-
shaped heart (fi g 3.53). Echocardiography
can show the anatomy as well as the degree
of stenosis. Cardiac CT and cardiac MRI can
give valuable information for planning the
surgery. 73
Management: Surgery is usually done be-
fore 1yr of age, with closure of the VSD and
correction of pulmonary stenosis.
Prognosis: Without surgery, mortality rate
is ~95% by age 20. After repair, 85% of pa-
tients survive to 35yrs. Common problems in
adulthood include pulmonary regurgitation,
causing RV dilatation and failure; RV outfl ow Fig 3.53 Boot-shaped heart.

rhythmias.
Patients with one ventricle
Many patients born with single-ventricle hearts (eg hypoplastic left heart syn-
drome) will undergo a Fontan procedure. This results in systemic venous blood
fl owing directly into the pulmonary arteries and the single ventricle being used
to pump oxygenated blood into the aorta. The lack of a right heart results in
many of the signs and symptoms of right heart failure and puts the patient at
risk of rapid cardiac decompensation. When looking after these patients,
seek advice from specialist ACHD centres.

Driving and the heart
UK licences are inscribed ‘You are required by law to inform Drivers Medical Branch,
DVLA, Swansea SA99 1AT at once if you have any disability (physical or medical), which
is, or may become likely to aff ect your fi tness as a driver, unless you do not expect
it to last more than 3 months’. It is the responsibility of drivers to inform the DVLA
(the UK Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority), and that of their doctors to advise
patients that medical conditions74 (and drugs) may aff ect their ability to drive and
for which conditions patients should inform the DVLA. Drivers should also inform
their insurance company of any condition disclosed to the DVLA. If in doubt, ask your
defence union.
The following are examples of the guidance for holders of standard licences; diff er-
ent rules apply for group 2 vehicle licence-holders (eg lorries, buses). More can be
found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/cardiovascular-disorders-assessing-fi tness-to-drive.
Angina Driving must cease when symptoms occur at rest or with emotion. Driving
may recommence when satisfactory symptom control is achieved. DVLA need not
be notifi ed.
Angioplasty Driving must cease for 1wk, and may recommence thereafter provided
no other disqualifying condition. DVLA need not be notifi ed.
MI If successfully treated with angioplasty, cease driving for 1 week provided urgent
intervention not planned and LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) >40%, and no
other disqualifying condition. Otherwise, driving must cease for 1 month. DVLA need
not be notifi ed.
Dysrhythmias Including sinoatrial disease, AF/fl utter, atrioventricular conduction
defects, and narrow or broad complex tachycardias. Driving must cease if the dys-
rhythmia has caused or is likely to cause incapacity. Driving may recommence 4wks
after successful control provided there is no other disqualifying condition.
Pacemaker implant Stop driving for 1wk, the patient must notify the DVLA.
Implanted cardioverter/defi brillator The licence is subject to annual review.
Driving may occur when these criteria can be met:
• 6 months have passed since ICD implanted for secondary prevention.
• 1 month has passed since ICD implanted for primary prophylaxis.
• The device has not administered therapy (shock and/or symptomatic antitachycar-
dia pacing) within the last 6 months (except during testing).
• No therapy (shock) in the last 2 years has been accompanied by incapacity (wheth-
er caused by the device or arrhythmia)—unless this was a result of device malfunc-
tion which has been corrected for at least 1 month or steps have been taken to
avoid recurrence (eg ablation) which have been successful for at least 6 months.
• A period of 1 month off driving must occur following any revision of the device
(generator and/or electrode) or alteration of antiarrhythmics.
• The device is subject to regular review with interrogation.
• There is no other disqualifying condition.
Syncope Simple faint: No restriction. Unexplained syncope: With probable car-
diac aetiology—4wks off driving if cause identifi ed and treated; otherwise 6 months
off . Loss of consciousness or altered awareness associated with signs of seizure
requires 6 months off driving. If the patient is known to be epileptic or has had
another such episode in the preceeding 5yrs, they must abstain from driving for
1yr. See driving and epilepsy (BOX). Patients who have had a single episode of loss of
consciousness with no cause found despite neurological and cardiac investigations,
must abstain from driving for 6 months.
Hypertension Driving may continue unless treatment causes unacceptable side-
eff ects. DVLA need not be notifi ed.

Other conditions: UK DVLA states it must be informed if a driver suff ers
from medical conditions including:
• Epilepsy (the patient must have had at least two seizures in the last 5yrs). An
epileptic patient who has suff ered an epileptic attack while awake must not
drive for 1yr from the date of the attack. Patients who have seizures that do
not aff ect their consciousness (eg simple partial seizures) or seizures only dur-
ing sleep may be allowed to drive. Being allowed to drive is conditional on the
patient following medical advice and there not being reason to believe they are
at high risk of further seizures.
• TIA or stroke. These patients should not drive for at least 1 month. There is no
need to inform the DVLA unless there is residual neurological defect after 1 month,
eg visual fi eld defect. If TIAS have been recurrent and frequent, a 3-month period
free of attacks may be required.
• Sudden attacks or disabling giddiness, fainting, or blackouts.
• Chronic neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s (any
‘freezing’ or on–off eff ects), and motor neuron diseases.
• Severe mental disorders; including serious memory problems and severe psy-
chiatric illness. Those with dementia should only drive if the condition is mild
(do not rely on armchair judgements: on-the-road trials are better). Encourage
relatives to contact DVLA if a dementing relative should not be driving. GPs may
desire to breach confi dentiality (the GMC approves) and inform DVLA of demented
or psychotic patients (tel. 01792 783686). Many elderly drivers (~1 in 3) who die in
accidents are found to have Alzheimer’s.
• A pacemaker, defi brillator, or antiventricular tachycardia device fi tted.
• Diabetes controlled by insulin or tablets. The main issues which may result in
driving bans are impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia and impaired vision.
• Angina while driving.
• Any type of brain surgery, brain tumour. Severe head injury involving inpatient
treatment at hospital.
• Continuing/permanent diffi culty in the use of arms or legs which aff ects ability
to control a vehicle.
• Dependence on or misuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, or chemical substances in the
past 3yrs (do not include drink/driving off ences).
• Any visual disability which aff ects both eyes (do not declare short/long sight or
colour blindness).
Vision (new drivers) should be 6/9 on Snellen’s scale in the better eye and 6/12 on
the Snellen scale in the other eye, wearing glasses or contact lenses if needed, and
3/60 in each eye without glasses or contact lenses.
The above-listed rules apply to standard licences only, for group 2 entitlement (eg
HGV drivers) see www.dvla.gov.uk/medical/ataglance.aspx.

Respiratory health
The lungs provide a vital physiological function in allowing gas exchange, but
are also at the vanguard of a constant battle between host, pathogens, and
pollutants. Respiratory medicine exemplifi es how careful epidemiology, science,
and randomized controlled trials have revolutionized our understanding of com-
mon diseases, leading to preventative measures and eff ective treatments. How-
ever, the importance of poverty and general improvements in public health cannot
be underestimated. Rates of TB in the UK declined well before the introduction of
BCG vaccination and streptomycin, largely due to improvements in sanitation and
less dense living conditions. Public health campaigns and taxation have helped
lower smoking rates, although reductions in lung cancer will lag behind for many
years.

Bedside tests in chest medicine
There is no substitute for careful history taking and examination in making the ‘correct’
diagnosis. Tests should help clarify and assess severity. When examining the chest
think about the anatomy, and the location of pathology (fi g 4.2).
Sputum examination Collect a good sample; if necessary ask a physiotherapist to
help. Note the appearance: clear and colourless (chronic bronchitis), yellow-green or
brown (pulmonary infection), red (haemoptysis), black (smoke, coal dust), or frothy
white-pink (pulmonary oedema). Send the sample to the laboratory for microscopy,
culture/sensitivity. If indicated, ask for ZN stain, and PCR.
Peak expiratory fl ow (PEF) Measured by a maximal forced expiration through a peak
fl ow meter. It correlates well with the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) & is
used as an estimate of airway calibre in asthma, but is eff ort-dependent.
Pulse oximetry Allows non-invasive assessment of peripheral O2 saturation (SpO2).
Useful for monitoring those who are acutely ill or at risk of deterioration. Target oxy-
gen saturations are usually 94–98% in a well patient or 88–92% in those with certain
pre-exisiting lung pathology (eg COPD). Oxygen saturation of <92% in a normally well
person is a serious sign and arterial blood gases (ABGS) should be checked. Causes
of erroneous readings: poor perfusion, movement, skin pigmentation, nail varnish,
dys haemoglobina emias, and carbon monoxide poisoning. As with any bedside test,
be sceptical, and check ABGS, whenever indicated (p188).
Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis Heparinized blood is usually taken from the radial
or femoral artery (see p771). The brachial artery is used less because of median nerve
proximity and it is an end artery. pH, PaO2, PaCO2, HCO
3
are measured using an auto-
mated analyser.
ABG interpretation See pp188–9.
Spirometry (See table 4.1) Measures functional lung volumes. Forced expiratory
volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are measured from a full forced ex-
piration into a spirometer (Vitalograph®); exhalation continues until no more breath
can be exhaled. FEV1 is less eff ort-dependent than PEF. The FEV1/FVC ratio gives a good
estimate of the severity of airfl ow obstruction; and helps classify COPD severity. Ob-
structive defect: (fi g 4.3) Asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD, cystic fi brosis. Restrictive
defect: Fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, interstitial pneumonias, connective
tis sue diseases, pleural eff usion, obesity, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular problems.

Lung function tests PEF, FEV1, FVC (see p162). Total lung capacity (TLC) and re-
sidual volume (RV) are useful in distinguishing obstructive and restrictive diseases
(see fi g 4.4). TLC and RV are increased in obstructive airways disease and reduced in
restrictive lung diseases and musculoskeletal abnormalities. The gas transfer coef-
fi cient (KCO) represents the carbon monoxide diff using capacity (DLCO) corrected for
alveolar volume. It is calculated by measuring carbon monoxide uptake from a single
inspiration in a standard time (usually 10s) and lung volume by helium dilution. Low
in emphysema and interstitial lung disease, high in alveolar haemorrhage. 1 Flow–
volume loop (see fi g 4.5) measures fl ow at various lung volumes. Characteristic pat-
terns are seen with intra-thoracic airways obstruction (asthma, emphysema) and
extra-thoracic airways obstruction (tracheal stenosis).
Radiology Chest x-ray: See p722. Ultrasound: Used in diagnosing and guiding
drainage of pleural eff usions (particularly loculated eff usions) and empyema. Ra-
dionuclide scans: Ventilation/perfusion (V/Q, p738) scans are occasionally used to
diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), eg in pregnancy (unmatched perfusion defects
are seen). Bone scans are used to diagnose bone metastases. PET scans to assess
cancer and infl ammation. Computed tomography: (CT, p730) Used for diagnosing
and staging lung cancer, imaging the hila, mediastinum, and pleura, and guiding
biopsies. Thin (1–1.5mm) section high-resolution CT (HRCT) is used in the diagnosis of
interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and bronchiectasis. CT pulmonary angiography
(CTPA) is used in the diagnosis of PE. Pulmonary angiography: Now rarely used for
diagnosing pulmonary hypertension.
Fibreoptic bronchoscopy Performed under local anaesthetic via the nose or
mouth. Diagnostic indications: Suspected lung carcinoma, slowly resolving pneu-
monia, pneumonia in the immunosuppressed, interstitial lung disease. Bronchoal-
veolar lavage fl uid may be sent to the lab for microscopy, culture, and cytology.
Mucosal abnormalities may be brushed (cytology) and biopsied (histopathology).
Therapeutic indications: Aspiration of mucus plugs causing lobar collapse, removal
of foreign bodies, stenting or treating tumours, eg laser. Pre-procedure investiga-
tions: FBC, coagulation, CXR, CT, spirometry, pulse oximetry, and ABG (if indicated).
Complications: Hypoxia, bleeding, pneumo thorax (fi g 16.43, p749). Diagnostic sensi-
tivity for cancer 50–90%, depends on tumour location; gene profi ling of cell sample
may improve this. 2 May also be used to deliver an ultrasound probe (endobronchial
ultrasound), and treatments—eg stents, or cryotherapy.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed at the time of bronchoscopy by in-
stilling and aspirating a known volume of warmed, buff ered 0.9% saline into the
distal airway. Diagnostic indications: Suspected malignancy, pneumonia, in the im-
munosuppressed (especially HIV), bronchiectasis, suspected TB (if sputum negative),
interstitial lung diseases (eg sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, histiocytosis X).
Therapeutic indications: alveolar proteinosis.1 Complications: Hypoxia (give sup-
plemental O2), transient fever, transient CXR shadow, infection (rare).
Lung biopsy May be performed in several ways. Percutaneous needle biopsy is
performed under radiological guidance and is useful for peripheral lung and pleural
lesions. Transbronchial biopsy performed at bronchoscopy may help in diagnos-
ing interstitial lung diseases, eg sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis. Alterna-
tives: If unsuccessful, consider open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopy.
Surgical procedures are performed under general anaesthetic. Rigid bronchos-
copy provides a wide lumen, enables larger mucosal biopsies, control of bleeding,
and removal of foreign bodies. Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy enable ex-
amination and biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes/lesions. Thoracoscopy allows
examination and biopsy of pleural lesions, drainage of pleural eff usions, and talc
pleurodesis and pleurectomy.
1 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis causes cough, dyspnoea, and restrictive spirometry. It is caused by ac-
cumulation of surfactant-derived acidophilic phospholipid/protein compounds which fi ll alveoli and distal
bronchioles. Diagnosis may require lung biopsy. Cause: primary genetic or antibody problem, or secondary
to infl ammation caused by inhaling silica, aluminium, or titanium. 3

Pneumonia
An acute lower respiratory tract infection associated with fever, symptoms and
signs in the chest, and abnormalities on the chest x-ray—fi g 16.2, p723. Incidence:
5–11/1000,  if very young or old (30% are under 65yrs). Mortality: ~21% in hospital.
Classifi cation and causes
Community-acquired pneumonia: (CAP) May be primary or secondary to under-
lying disease. Typical organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae (commonest), Hae-
mophilus infl uenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Atypicals: Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, and Chlamydia. Gram-negative bacilli,
Coxiella burnetii and anaerobes are rarer (?aspiration). Viruses account for up to
15%. Flu may be complicated by community-acquired MRSA pneumonia.
Hospital-acquired: Defi ned as >48h after hospital admission. Most commonly
Gram-negative enterobacteria or Staph. aureus. Also Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,
Bacteroides, and Clostridia.
Aspiration: Those with stroke, myasthenia, bulbar palsies, consciousness (eg post-
ictal or intoxicated), oesophageal disease (achalasia, refl ux), or poor dental hygiene
risk aspirating oropharyngeal anaerobes.
Immunocompromised patient: Strep. pneumoniae, H. infl uenzae, Staph. aureus,
M. catarrhalis, M. pneumoniae, Gram Ωve bacilli and Pneumocystis jirovecii (for-
merly named P. carinii, pp400–1). Other fungi, viruses (CMV, HSV), and mycobacteria.
Clinical features Symptoms: Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough,
purulent sputum, haemoptysis, and pleuritic pain. Signs: Pyrexia, cyanosis, confus-
ion (can be the only sign in the elderly—may also be hypothermic), tachypnoea,
tachycardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (reduced expansion, dull percus-
sion, tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), and a pleural rub.
Tests Assess oxygenation: oxygen saturation, p162 (ABGs if SaO2 <92% or severe
pneumonia) and BP. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP (GPs should consider a point of care
CRP to guide antibiotic prescribing where LRTI is suspected, NICE 20144).
CXR (fi g 16.2, p723): lobar or multilobar infi ltrates, cavitation, or pleural eff usion. Spu-
tum for microscopy and culture. Urine: check for Legionella/Pneumococcal urinary
antigens. Atypical organism/viral serology (PCR sputum/BAL, complement fi xation
tests acutely, paired serology). Pleural fl uid may be aspirated for culture. Respira-
tory physicians may consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if patient
is immunocompromised or on ITU.
Severity ‘CURB-65’ is a simple, validated severity scoring system.5, 6 1 point for each of:
Confusion (abbreviated mental test ≤8)
Urea >7mmol/L
Respiratory rate ≥30/min
BP <90 systolic and/or 60mmHg diastolic)
Age ≥65.
0–1, PO antibiotic/home treatment; 2, hospital therapy; ≥3, severe pneumonia indicates
mortality 15–40%—consider ITU. It may ‘underscore’ the young—use clinical judgement.
Other features increasing the risk of death are: comorbidity; bilateral/multilobar; PaO2
<8kPa.
Management p816. Antibiotics—refer to your local hospital antibiotic policy. When
none exists, consult table 4.2. If pneumonia not severe and not vomiting (CURB-65 1–2)
give PO antibiotic; severe (CURB-65 >2) give IV. Oxygen: keep PaO2 >8.0 and/or satura-
tion ≥94%. IV fl uids (anorexia, dehydration, shock) and VTE prophylaxis. Analgesia if
pleurisy. Consider ITU if shock, hypercapnia, or remains hypoxic. Follow-up: at 6 weeks
(±CXR).
Complications (See p170.) Pleural eff usion, empyema, lung abscess, respiratory
failure, septicaemia, brain abscess, pericarditis, myocarditis, cholestatic jaundice.
Repeat CRP and CXR in patients not improving to look for progression/complications.

Specifi c pneumonias
Pneumococcal pneumonia The commonest bacterial pneumonia. Aff ects all ages,
but is commoner in the elderly, alcoholics, post-splenectomy, immunosuppressed,
and patients with chronic heart failure or pre-existing lung disease. Clinical fea-
tures: Fever, pleurisy, herpes labialis. CXR shows lobar consolidation. If mod/severe
check for urinary antigen. Treatment: amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, or cephalosporin.
Staphylococcal pneumonia May complicate infl uenza infection or occur in the
young, elderly, intravenous drug users, or patients with underlying disease, eg leu-
kaemia, lymphoma, cystic fi brosis (CF). It causes a bilateral cavitating bronchopneu-
monia. Treatment: fl ucloxacillin ± rifampicin, MRSA: contact lab; consider vancomycin.
Klebsiella pneumonia Rare. Occurs in elderly, diabetics, and alcoholics. Causes a
cavitating pneumonia, particularly of the upper lobes, often drug resistant. Treat-
ment: cefotaxime or imipenem.
Pseudomonas A common pathogen in bronchiectasis and CF. It also causes
hospital-acquired infections, particularly on ITU or after surgery. Treatment: anti-
pseudomonal penicillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, or ciprofl oxacin + aminoglycoside.
Consider dual therapy to minimize resistance.
Mycoplasma pneumoniae Occurs in epidemics about every 4yrs. It presents in-
sidiously with fl u-like symptoms (headache, myalgia, arthralgia) followed by a dry
cough. CXR: reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation often of one lower
lobe, and worse than signs suggest. Diagnosis: PCR sputum or serology. Cold aggluti-
nins may cause an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications: Skin rash (ery-
thema multiforme, fi g 12.22, p563), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, meningoe ncephalitis
or myelitis; Guillain–Barré syndrome. Treatment: Clarithromycin (500mg/12h) or
doxycycline (200mg loading then 100mg OD) or a fl uroquinolone (eg ciprofl oxacin
or norfl oxacin).
Legionella pneumophila Colonizes water tanks kept at <60°C (eg hotel air-con-
ditioning and hot water systems) causing outbreaks. Flu-like symptoms (fever,
malaise, myalgia) precede a dry cough and dyspnoea. Extra-pulmonary features in-
clude anorexia, D&V, hepatitis, renal failure, confusion, and coma. CXR shows bi-basal
consolidation. Blood tests may show lymphopenia, hyponatraemia, and deranged
LFTS. Urinalysis may show haematuria. Diagnosis: Urine antigen/culture. Treatment:
fl uoroquinolone for 2–3wks or clarithromycin (p387). 10% mortality.
Chlamydophila pneumoniae The commonest chlamydial infection. Person-to-per-
son spread, biphasic illness: pharyngitis, hoarseness, otitis, followed by pneumonia.
Diagnosis: Chlamydophila complement fi xation test, PCR invasive samples. 7 Treat-
ment: Doxycycline or clarithromycin. Chlamydophila psittaci Causes psittacosis,
an ornithosis acquired from infected birds (typically parrots). Symptoms include
headache, fever, dry cough, lethargy, arthralgia, anorexia, and D&V. Extra-pulmonary
features are legion but rare, eg meningo-encephalitis, infective endocarditis, hepati-
tis, nephritis, rash, splenomegaly. CXR shows patchy consolidation. Diagnosis: Chla-
mydophila serology. Treatment: doxycycline or clarithromycin.
Viral pneumonia Infl uenza commonest (p396 and BOX), but ‘swine fl u’ (H1N1) is now
considered seasonal and covered by the annual ‘fl u vaccine. Others: measles, CMV,
varicella zoster.
Pneumocystis pneumonia Causes pneumonia in the immunosuppressed (eg HIV).
The organism responsible was previously called Pneumocystis carinii, and now
called Pneumocystis jirovecii. 8 It presents with a dry cough, exertional dyspnoea,
PaO2, fever, bilateral crepitations. CXR may be normal or show bilateral perihilar
interstitial shadowing. Diagnosis: Visualization of the organism in induced sputum,
bronchoalveolar lavage, or in a lung biopsy specimen. Drugs: High-dose co-trimox-
azole (pp400–1), or pentamidine by slow IVI for 2–3 weeks (p401). Steroids are bene-
fi cial if severe hypoxaemia. Prophyl axis is indicated if the CD4 count is <200≈106/L or
after the 1st attack. 9

Avian infl uenza
Avian infl uenza A viruses rarely infect humans and most follow direct or close
contact with infected poultry. The issue remains a public health priority because
of the ability of the virus to mutate. Symptoms range from conjunctivitis to infl u-
enza-like illness (low pathogenic forms) to severe respiratory illness and multi-
organ failure (highly pathogenic forms). H7N9 and H5N1 have been responsible for
most human illnesses worldwide. Suspect avian fl u if fever (>38°C), chest signs
or consolidation on CXR, or life-threatening infection, and contact with poultry or
others with similar symptoms.10 NB: D&V, abdominal pain, pleuritic pain, and bleed-
ing from the nose and gums are reported to be an early feature in some patients. 11
Diagnosis: Viral culture ± reverse transcriptase-PCR with H5 & N1 specifi c primers. 12
Management: Get help. Contain the outbreak,2 p397, in the UK, via your consult-
ant in communicable disease control.13 Ventilatory support + O2 and antivirals may
be needed. Most viruses are susceptible to oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir.
Nebulizers and high-air fl ow O2 masks are implicated in nosocomial spread. 11,14
Precautions for close contacts of infected patients:
Hand hygiene, avoid shared utensils and face-to-face contact, wear high-effi ciency
masks and eye protection. Start empirical antiviral treatment (oseltamivir within
48 hours of exposure and zanamivir within 36 hours). Monitor for fever, cough,
shortness of breath, diarrhoea, or other systemic symptoms developing.
Coronaviruses: SARS and MERS
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS15) is caused by SARS-COV virus—a
corona virus. Major features are persistent fever (>38°C), chills, rigors, myalgia,
dry cough, headache, diarrhoea, and dyspnoea—with an abnormal CXR and WCC.
Respiratory failure is a complicating feature: ~20% progress to acute respiratory
distress syndrome requiring invasive ventilation. 16 Mortality is 1–50%, depend-
ing on age, but no cases since 2004. Close contacts, or travel to an area with
known cases should raise suspicion. The mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV is
human–human. Management: seek expert help. Largely supportive with good
infection control measures.
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused
by novel coronavirus (MERS CoV) and was fi rst identifi ed in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.
Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal upset.
Incubation period 14 days. Human-to-human transmission has been reported in
most cases, but camels play a pivotal host role in animal-to-human transmission.
Large outbreaks linked to healthcare facilities have been reported in the Middle
East and South Korea. The World Health Organization has reported mortality as
high as 36% in known cases.13
2 Therapeutic or prophylactic antivirals are said to be the most eff ective single intervention followed by
vaccine and basic public health measures. 17 But oseltamivir resistance and unavailability of a suitable vac-
cine during the early stages of a pandemic make non-drug interventions all the more important.

Complications of pneumonia
Respiratory failure (See p188.) Type I respiratory failure (PaO2 <8kPa) is relatively
common. Treatment is with high-fl ow (60%) oxygen. Transfer the patient to ITU if
hypoxia does not improve with O therapy or PCO rises to >6kPa. Be careful with
2 a 2
O2 in COPD patients; check ABGS frequently, and consider elective ventilation if rising
PaCO2 or worsening acidosis. Aim to keep SaO2 at 94–98%, PaO2 ≥8kPa.
Hypotension May be due to a combination of dehydration and vasodilation due
to sepsis. If systolic BP is <90mmHg, give an intravenous fl uid challenge of 250mL
colloid/crystalloid over 15min. If BP does not rise, consider a central line and give IV
fl uids to maintain the systolic BP >90mmHg. If systolic BP remains <90mmHg despite
fl uid therapy, request ITU assessment for inotropic support.
Atrial fi brillation (p130.) Common in the elderly. It usually resolves with treatment
of the pneumonia. -blocker or digoxin may be required to slow the ventricular re-
sponse rate in the short term.
Pleural eff usion Infl ammation of the pleura by adjacent pneumonia may cause fl uid
exudation into the pleural space. If this accumulates faster than it is reabsorbed, a
pleural eff usion develops. If small, it may be of no consequence. If larger and patient
symptomatic, or infected (empyema), drainage is required (p192, p766).
Empyema Pus in the pleural space. It should be suspected if a patient with a resolv-
ing pneumonia develops a recurrent fever. Clinical features: CXR indicates a pleural
eff usion. The aspirated pleural fl uid is typically yellow and turbid with a pH <7.2,
glucose, and LDH. The empyema should be drained using a chest drain, inserted
under radiological guidance. Adhesions and loculation can make this diffi cult.
Lung abscess A cavitating area of localized, suppurative infection within the lung
(see fi g 4.6).
Causes: •Inadequately treated pneumonia. •Aspiration (eg alcoholism, oesopha geal
obstruction, bulbar palsy). •Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body). •Pulmo-
nary infarction. •Septic emboli (septicaemia, right heart endocarditis, IV drug use).
•Subphrenic or hepatic abscess.
Clinical features: Swinging fever; cough; purulent, foul-smelling sputum; pleuritic
chest pain; haemoptysis; malaise; weight loss. Look for: fi nger clubbing; anaemia;
crepitations. Empyema develops in 20–30%.
Tests: Blood: FBC (anaemia, neutrophilia), ESR, CRP, blood cultures. Sputum micros-
copy, culture, and cytology. CXR: walled cavity, often with a fl uid level. Consider CT
scan to exclude obstruction, and bronchoscopy to obtain diagn ostic specimens.
Treatment: Antibiotics as indicated by sensitivities; continue until healed (4–6 wks).
Postural drainage. Repeated aspiration, antibiotic instillation, or surgical excision
may be required.
Septicaemia May occur as a result of bacterial spread from the lung parenchyma
into the bloodstream. This may cause metastatic infection, eg infective endoc arditis,
meningitis. Treat with IV antibiotic according to sensitivities.
Pericarditis and myocarditis May also complicate pneumonia.
Jaundice This is usually cholestatic, and may be due to sepsis or secondary to anti-
biotic therapy (particularly fl ucloxacillin and co-amoxiclav).

pneumatocele (=air cyst) or cavitating lesion. A moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax can also
be seen, suggesting that one of these lesions may have ruptured into the pleural cavity. The patient
also has a right subclavian central venous catheter for the administration of antibiotics. The diag-
nosis in this case was that of multiple pulmonary abscesses in a patient who was an intravenous

Bronchiectasis
Pathology Chronic infl ammation of the bronchi and bronchioles leading to perma-
nent dilatation and thinning of these airways.18 Main organisms: H. infl uenzae; Strep.
pneumoniae; Staph. aureus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Causes Congenital: Cystic fi brosis (CF); Young’s syndrome; primary ciliary dyskinesia;
Kartagener’s syndrome (OHCS p646). Post-infection: Measles; pertussis; bronchiolitis;
pneumonia; TB; HIV. Other: Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body); allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA, p177); hypogammaglobulinaemia; rheumatoid
arthritis; ulcerative colitis; idiopathic.
Clinical features Symptoms: Persistent cough; copious purulent sputum; intermit-
tent haemoptysis. Signs: Finger clubbing; coarse inspiratory crepitations; wheeze
(asthma, COPD, ABPA). Complications: Pneumonia, pleural eff usion; pneumothorax;
haemoptysis; cerebral abscess; amyloidosis.
Tests Sputum culture. CXR: Cystic shadows, thickened bronchial walls (tramline and
ring shadows); see fi g 4.7. HRCT chest (p164) to assess extent and distribution of
disease. Spirometry often shows an obstructive pattern; reversibility should be as-
sessed. Bronchoscopy to locate site of haemoptysis, exclude obstruction and obtain
samples for culture. Other tests: Serum immunoglobulins; CF sweat test; Aspergillus
precipitins or skin-prick test RAST and total IgE.
Management •Airway clearance techniques and mucolytics. Chest physi-
otherapy and devices such as a fl utter valve may aid sputum expectoration and
mucus drainage. •Antibiotics should be prescribed according to bacterial sensitivi-
ties. Patients known to culture Pseudomonas will require either oral ciprofl oxacin
or suitable IV antibiotics. If ≥3 exacerbations a year consider long-term antibiotics
(may be nebulized). •Bronchodilators (eg nebulized salbutamol) may be useful in
patients with asthma, COPD, CF, ABPA (p177). •Corticosteroids (eg prednisolone) and
itraconazole for ABPA. •Surgery may be indicated in localized disease or to control
severe haemoptysis.

Cystic fi brosis (CF)
One of the commonest life-threatening autosomal recessive conditions (1:2000 live
births) aff ecting Caucasians. 1:25 people carry a copy of the faulty gene. All UK babies
are screened at birth. Caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7 (>1500 mutations have been identifi ed). This
is a ClΩ channel, and the defect leads to a combination of defective chloride secretion
and increased sodium absorption across airway epithelium. The changes in the com-
position of airway surface liquid predispose the lung to chronic pulmonary infections
and bronchiectasis. See OHCS (‘Paediatrics’, p162) for more detail.
Clinical features Neonate: Failure to thrive; meconium ileus; rectal prolapse.
Children and young adults: Respiratory: cough; wheeze; recurrent infections;
bronchiectasis; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale.
Gastrointestinal: pancreatic insuffi ciency (diabetes mellitus, steatorrhoea); distal
intestinal obstruction syndrome (meconium ileus equivalent); gallstones; cirrhosis.
Other: male infertility; osteoporosis; arthritis; vasculitis (p556); nasal polyps; sinusi-
tis; and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA). Signs: cyanosis; fi nger
clubbing; bilateral coarse crackles.
Diagnosis Sweat test: Sweat sodium and chloride >60mmol/L; chloride usu-
ally > sodium. Genetics: Screening for known common CF mutations should be con-
sidered. Faecal elastase is a simple and useful screening test for exocrine pancreatic
dysfunction.
Tests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT; clotting; vitamin A, D, E levels; annual glucose tolerance test
(p206). Bacteriology: Cough swab, sputum culture. Radiology: CXR; hyperi nfl ation;
bronchiectasis. Abdominal ultrasound: Fatty liver; cirrhosis; chronic pancreatitis;
Spirometry: Obstructive defect. Aspergillus serology/skin test (20% develop ABPA,
p177). Biochemistry: Faecal fat analysis.
Management Management should be multidisciplinary, eg physician, GP, physi-
otherapist, specialist nurse, and dietician, with attention to psychosocial as well
as physical wellbeing. Chest: Physiotherapy (postural drainage, airway clearance
techniques). Antibiotics are given for acute infective exacerbations and prophylacti-
cally. Chronic Pseudomonas infection is an important predictor of survival. Muco-
lytics may be useful (eg DNase, ie Dornase alfa, 2.5mg daily nebulized, or nebulized
hypertonic saline). Bronchodilators. Annual CXR surveillance is recommended. Gas-
trointestinal: Malabsorption, GORD, distal obstruction syndrome. Pancreatic enzyme
replacement; fat-soluble vitamin suppl ements (A, D, E, K); ursodeoxycholic acid for
impaired liver function; cirrhosis may require liver transplantation. Other: Treatment
of CF-related diabetes (screen annually with OGTT from 12yrs); screening/treatment
of osteoporosis (DEXA bone scanning); arthritis, sinusitis, and vasculitis; fertility and
genetic counselling. Advanced lung disease: Oxygen, diuretics (cor pulmonale); non-
invasive ventilation; lung or heart/lung transplantation (post-transplant survival
5 years). Prognosis: Median survival is now ~ 41yrs in the UK, although a baby born
today would expect to live longer.
Mutation-specifi c therapies for cystic fi brosis
Ivacaftor and lumacaftor target the CFTR protein. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator,
targets gating defects in disease causing CFTR mutations including G551D. Ivacaftor
increases the open probability of CFTR channels and has been shown to improve
clinical outcomes (lung function, weight, lung disease stability) in CF patients >6
years old.19 Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector, and has been shown to correct F508
del CFTR misprocessing and increase the amount of cell surface–localized protein.
Ivacaftor and lumacaftor combination therapy, for patients with F508 del, have
shown improved lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerations.20
Gene therapy (transfer of CFTR gene using liposome or adenovirus vectors):
phase 2b studies show modest but signifi cant improvement in FEV1 in those receiv-
ing gene therapy.21 Further work into vectors for gene transfer is ongoing.

Lung tumours
Carcinoma of the bronchus Second most common cancer in the UK, accounting
for 13% of all new cancer cases and 27% of cancer deaths (40 000 cases/yr in UK).22
Incidence is increasing in women. Only 5% ‘cured’. Risk factors: Cigarette smoking
(causes 90% of lung ca). Others: passive smoking, asbestos, chromium, arsenic, iron
oxides, and radiation (radon gas).
Histology: Clinically the most important division is between small cell (SCLC) and
non-small cell (NSCLC). NSCLC: Squamous (35%); adenocarcinoma (27%), large cell
(10%); adenocarcinoma in situ (rare, <1%). Small cell (oat cell) (20%): Arise from
endocrine cells (Kulchitsky cells), often secreting polypeptide hormones resulting in
paraneoplastic syndromes (eg production of ACTH, Cushing’s syndrome). Most (70%)
SCLC are disseminated at presentation.
Symptoms: Cough (80%); haemoptysis (70%); dyspnoea (60%); chest pain (40%);
recurrent or slowly resolving pneumonia; lethargy, anorexia; weight loss.
Signs: Cachexia; anaemia; clubbing; HPOA (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropa-
thy, causing wrist pain); supraclavicular or axillary nodes. Chest signs: none, or con-
solidation; coll apse; pleural eff usion. Metastases: bone tenderness; hepatomegaly;
confusion; fi ts; focal CNS signs; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy; peripheral
neuropathy.
Complications: Local: recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; phrenic nerve palsy; SVC
obstruction; Horner’s syndrome (Pancoast’s tumour); rib erosion; pericarditis; AF.
Metastatic: brain; bone (bone pain, anaemia, Ca2+); liver; adrenals (Addison’s). Non-
metastatic neurological: confusion; fi ts; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy;
neuropathy; polymyositis; Lambert–Eaton syndrome (p512). See table 4.3.
Tests: CXR: peripheral nodule (fi g 4.8); hilar enlargement; consolidation; lung col-
lapse; pleu ral eff usion; bony secondaries. Cytology: sputum and pleural fl uid (send
at least 20mL). Fine needle aspiration or biopsy (peripheral lesions/lymph nodes).
CT to stage the tumour (p176) and guide bronchoscopy. Broncho scopy: to give histol-
ogy and assess operability, ± endobronchial ultrasound for assessment and biopsy.
18F-deoxyglucose PET or PET/CT EBUS scan to help in staging. Radionuclide bone scan:
if suspected metastases. Lung function tests: help assess suitability for lobectomy.
Other lung tumours Bronchial adenoma: Rare, slow-growing. 90% are carcinoid
tumours; 10% cylindromas. : surgery. Hamartoma: Rare, benign; CT: lobulated mass
± fl ecks of calcifi cation; ?excise to exclude malignancy.
Malignant mesothelioma A tumour of mesothelial cells that usually occurs in the
pleura, and rarely in the peritoneum or other organs. It is associated with occupa-
tional exposure to asbestos but the relationship is complex. 23 90% report previous
exposure to asbestos, but only 20% of patients have pulmonary asbestosis. The la-
tent period between exposure and development of the tumour may be up to 45yrs.
Compensation is often available.
Clinical features: Chest pain, dyspnoea, weight loss, fi nger clubbing, recurrent pleu-
ral eff usions. Signs of metastases: lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, bone pain/ten-
derness, abdominal pain/obstr uction (peritoneal malignant mesothelioma).
Tests: CXR/CT: pleural thickening/eff usion. Bloody pleural fl uid.
Diagnosis: Made on histology, usually following a thoracoscopy. Often the diagnosis
is only made post-mortem.
Management: Pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy can improve survival. 24 Surgery
is hard to evaluate (few randomized trials). Radiotherapy is controversial. Pleurodesis
and indwelling intra-pleural drain may help.
Prognosis: Poor (especially without pemetrexed, eg <2yrs). >650 deaths/yr in UK.

Lung tumours: staging and treatment
Assessing the extent of tumour spread (staging) is vital to determining the best
course of treatment and also prognosis. All patients who may be suitable for surgery
with curative intent should be off ered PET-CT before treatment.25 Some patients may
undergo endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspirations for me-
diastinal masses. TNM staging classifi cation for non-small cell lung cancer is shown
in table 4.4. You do not need to memorize this!

Treatment NSCLC: Lobectomy (open or thoracoscopic) is the treatment of choice
if medically fi t and aim is curative intent or parenchymal sparing operation for pa-
tients with borderline fi tness and smaller tumours ((T1a–b, N0, M0). Radical radio-
therapy for patient with stage I, II, III NSCLC. Chemotherapy ± radiotherapy for more
advanced disease. Regimens may be platinum based, eg with monoclonal antibodies
targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (cetuximab). SCLC: consider sur-
gery with limited stage disease. Chemotherapy ± radiotherapy if well enough. Palli-
ation: Radiotherapy is used for bronchial obstruction, SVC obstru ction, haemoptysis,
bone pain, and cerebral metastases. SVC stent + radiot herapy and dexamethasone
for SVC obstruction. Endo bronchial therapy: tracheal stenting, cryotherapy, laser,
brachytherapy (radioactive source is placed close to the tumour). Pleural drainage/
pleurodesis for symptomatic pleural eff usions. Drugs: analgesia; steroids; anti-
emetics; cough linctus; bronchodilators; antidepressants.
Prognosis Non-small cell: 50% 2yr survival without spread; 10% with spread. Small
cell: median survival is 3 months if untreated; 1–1½yrs if treated.
Prevention Stop smoking (p93). Prevent occupational exposure to carcinogens.

Fungi and the lung
Aspergillus This group of fungi aff ects the lung in fi ve ways:
1 Asthma: Type I hypersensitivity reaction to fungal spores (p178).
2 Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): Results from type I and III
hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus fumigatus. Aff ects 1–5% of asthmat-
ics, 2–25% of CF patients.26 Initially bronchoconstriction, then permanent dam-
age occurs causing bronchiectasis (fi g 4.9). Symptoms: wheeze, cough, sputum
(plugs of mucus containing fungal hyphae, see p408), dyspnoea, and ‘recurrent
pneumonia’. Investigations: CXR (transient segmental collapse or consolida-
tion, bronchiectasis); Aspergillus in sputum; positive Aspergillus skin test and/
or Aspergillus-specifi c IgE RAST (radioallergosorbent test); positive serum pre-
cipitins; eosinophilia; raised serum IgE. Treatment: prednisolone 30–40mg/24h
PO for acute attacks; maintenance dose 5–10mg/d. Itraconazole can be used in
combination with corticosteroids. Bronchodilators for asthma. Sometimes bron-
choscopic aspiration of mucus plugs is needed.
3 Aspergilloma (mycetoma): A fungus ball within a pre-existing cavity (often
caused by TB or sarcoidosis). It is usually asymptomatic but may cause cough,
haemoptysis (may be torrential), lethargy ± weight loss. Investigations: CXR
(round opacity within a cavity, usually apical); sputum culture; strongly posi-
tive serum precipitins; Aspergillus skin test (30% +ve). Treatment (only if symp-
tomatic): consider surgical excision for solitary symptomatic lesions or severe
haemoptysis. Oral itraconazole and other antifungals have been tried with lim-
ited success. Local instillation of amphotericin paste under CT guidance yields
partial success in carefully selected patients, eg in massive haemoptysis.
4 Invasive aspergillosis: Risk factors: 27 immunocompromise, eg HIV, leukaemia,
burns, Wegener’s (p714), and SLE, or after broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In-
vestigations: sputum culture; BAL; biopsy; serum precipitins; CXR (consolidation,
abscess). Early chest CT and serial serum measurements of galactomannan (an
Aspergillus antigen) may be helpful. Diagnosis may only be made at lung biopsy
or autopsy. Treatment: voriconazole is superior to IV amphotericin. 28 Alterna-
tives: IV miconazole or ketoconazole (less eff ective). Prognosis: 30% mortality.
5 Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA): See p198.
Other fungal infections Candida and Cryptococcus may cause pneumonia in the
immunosuppressed (see p408).

Asthma
Asthma aff ects 5–8% of the population. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of
dyspnoea, cough, and wheeze caused by reversible airways obstruction. Three fac-
tors contribute to airway narrowing: bronchial muscle contraction, triggered by a
variety of stimuli; mucosal swelling/infl ammation, caused by mast cell and basophil
degranulation resulting in the release of infl ammatory mediators; and increased
mucus production.
Symptoms Intermittent dyspnoea, wheeze, cough (often nocturnal), and sputum
(see table 4.5).
Precipitants: Cold air, exercise, emotion, allergens (house dust mite, pollen, fur),
infection, smoking and passive smoking,29 pollution, NSAIDS, -blockers.
Diurnal variation Symptoms or peak fl ow may vary over the day. Marked morning
dipping of peak fl ow is common and can tip the balance into a serious attack, despite
having normal peak fl ow (fi g 4.12) at other times.
Exercise: Quantify the exercise tolerance.
Disturbed sleep: Quantify as nights per week (a sign of severe asthma).
Acid refl ux: 40–60% of those with asthma have refl ux; treating it improves spirom-
etry, but not necessarily symptoms.3 0
Other atopic disease: Eczema, hay fever, allergy, or family history?
The home (especially the bedroom): Pets? Carpet? Feather pillows or duvet? Floor
cushions and other ‘soft furnishings’?
Job: If symptoms remit at weekends or holidays, work may provide the trigger (15%
of cases are work-related—more for paint sprayers, food processors, welders, and
animal handlers). 31 Ask the patient to measure their peak fl ow at intervals at work
and at home (at the same time of day) to confi rm this (see fi g 4.13).
Days per week off work or school.
Signs Tachypnoea; audible wheeze; hyperinfl ated chest; hyper-resonant percus-
sion note; air entry; widespread, polyphonic wheeze. Severe attack: Inability to
complete sentences; pulse >110bpm; respiratory rate >25/min; PEF 33–50% predicted.
Life-threatening attack: Silent chest; confusion; exhaustion; cyanosis (PaO2 <8kPa
but PaCO2 4.6–6.0, SpO2 <92%); bradyc ardia; PEF <33% predicted. Near fatal: PaCO2.
Tests Initial diagnosis: See fi gs 4.10, 4.11. Acute attack: PEF, sputum culture, FBC,
U&E, CRP, blood cultures. ABG analysis usually shows a normal or slightly PaO2 but
PaCO2 (hyperventilation). If PaO2 is normal but the patient is hyperventilating, watch
carefully and repeat the ABG a little later. If PaCO2 is normal or raised, transfer
to high-dependency unit or ITU for ventilation, as this signifi es failing respiratory
eff ort. CXR (to exclude infection or pneumothorax). Chronic asthma: PEF monitoring
(p162): a diurnal variation of >20% on ≥3d a wk for 2wks. Spirometry: obstructive
defect (FEV1/FVC, RV p162); usually ≥15% improvement in FEV1 following 2 agonists
or steroid trial. CXR: hyperinfl ation. Skin-prick tests may help to identify allergens.
Histamine or methacholine challenge. Aspergillus serology.
Diff erential diagnosis Pulmonary oedema (‘cardiac asthma’); COPD (may co-exist);
large airway obstruction (eg foreign body, tumour); SVC obstruction (wheeze/dys-
pnoea not episodic); pneumothorax; PE; bronchiectasis; obliterative bronchiolitis
(suspect in elderly).
Treatment Chronic asthma (p182). Emergency treatment (p810).
Associated diseases Acid refl ux; polyarteritis nodosa (PAN, p556); Churg–Strauss
syndrome (p696); ABPA (p177).
Natural history Most childhood asthmatics (see OHCS p164) either grow out of
asthma in adolescence or suff er much less as adults. A signifi cant number of people
develop chronic asthma late in life.
Mortality ~900 asthma deaths in the UK in 2012, 50% were >65yrs old.

Management of chronic asthma
Lifestyle Help to quit smoking (p93). Avoid precipitants. Weight loss if overweight.
Check inhaler technique. Teach use of a peak fl ow meter to monitor PEF twice a
day. Educate to enable self-management by altering their medication in the light of
symptoms or PEF. Give specifi c advice about what to do in an emergency; provide
a written action plan. Consider teaching relaxed breathing to avoid dysfunctional
breathing 32 (Papworth method).3
British Thoracic Society guidelines (BTS33) Start at the step most appropriate
to severity; moving up if needed, or down if control is good for >3 months. Rescue
courses of prednisolone may be used at any time. For drug examples see table 4.6.
• Step 1: Occasional short-acting inhaled 2-agonist as required for symptom relief.
If used more than once daily, or night-time symptoms, go to Step 2.
• Step 2: Add standard-dose inhaled steroid, eg beclometasone 200–800mcg/day, or
start at the dose appropriate for disease severity, and titrate as required.
• Step 3: Add long-acting 2-agonist (eg salmeterol 50mcg/12h by inhaler). If bene-
fi t—but still inadequate control—continue and dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/
day. If no eff ect then stop LABA and dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/day. Leu-
kotriene receptor antagonist or oral theophylline may be tried.
• Step 4: Consider trials of: beclometasone up to 2000mcg/day; modifi ed-release oral
theophylline; modifi ed-release oral 2-agonist tablets; oral leukotriene receptor an-
tagonist, in conjunction with previous therapy.
• Step 5: Add regular oral prednisolone (1 dose daily, at the lowest possible dose).
Continue with high-dose inhaled steroids. Refer for specialist input.
Drugs 2-adrenoceptor agonists: Relax bronchial smooth muscle (CAMP), acting
within minutes. Salbutamol is best given by inhalation (aerosol, powder, nebulizer),
but may also be given PO or IV. SE: tachyarrhythmias, K+, tremor, anxiety. Long-act-
ing inhaled 2-agonist (eg salmeterol, formoterol) can help nocturnal symptoms and
reduce morning dips. They may be an alternative to steroid dose when symptoms
are uncontrolled; doubts remain over whether they are associated with an increase
in adverse events. 34 SE: as salbutamol, paradoxical bronchospasm. 35
Corticosteroids: Best inhaled to minimize systemic eff ects, eg beclometasone via
spacer (or powder), but may be given PO or IV. They act over days to bronchial mu-
cosal infl ammation. Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids to prevent oral candidiasis.
Oral steroids are used acutely (high-dose, short courses, eg prednisolone 40mg/24h
PO for 7d) and longer term in lower dose (eg 5–10mg/24h) if control is not optimal on
inhalers. Warn about SEs: p377.
Aminophylline: (Metabolized to theophylline) acts by inhibiting phospho diesterase,
thus bronchoconstriction by CAMP levels. Try as prophylaxis, at night, PO, to prevent
morning dipping. Stick with one brand name (bioavailability variable). Also useful
as an adjunct if inhaled therapy is inadequate. In acute severe asthma, it may be
given IVI. It has a narrow therapeutic ratio, causing arrhythmias, GI upset, and fi ts
in the toxic range. Check theophylline levels (p756), and do ECG monitoring and check
plasma levels after 24h if IV therapy is used.
Anticholinergics: (Eg ipratropium, tiotropium.) May muscle spasm synergistically
with 2-agonists but are not recommended in current guidelines for chronic asthma.
They may be of more benefi t in COPD.
Cromoglicate (Mast cell stabilizer.) May be used as prophylaxis in mild and exercise-
induced asthma (always inhaled), especially in children. It may precipitate asthma.
Leukotriene receptor antagonists: (Eg oral montelukast, zafi rlukast.) Block the ef-
fects of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the airways by antagonizing the CystLT1 receptor.
Anti-IgE monoclonal antibody: Omalizumab 36 may be of use in highly selected
patients with persistent allergic asthma. Given as a subcutaneous injection every
2–4 wks depending on dose. Specialists prescribe only.
3 Integrated breathing and relaxation training (Papworth method) is psychological and physical:
patients learn to drop their shoulders, relax their abdomen, and breathe calmly and appropriately.

coordination, eg Airomir® (salbutamol) and Qvar® (beclometasone). Accuhalers® deliver dry powders
(eg Flixotide®, Serevent®).
Systemic absorption (via the throat) is less if inhalation is through a large-volume device, eg Volumatic® or
AeroChamber Plus® devices. The latter is more compact. Static charge on some devices reduces dose deliv-
ery, so wash in water before dose; leave to dry (don’t rub). It’s pointless to squirt many puff s into a device:
it is best to repeat single doses, and be sure to inhale as soon as the drug is in the spacer. SE: local (oral)
candidiasis (p377); rate of cataract if lifetime dose ≥2g beclometasone. 37
Prescribe beclometasone by brand name, and state that a CFC-free inhaler should
be dispensed. This is because, dose for dose, Qvar® is twice as potent as the other
available CFC-free brand (Clenil Modulite®).
Any dose ≥250mcg ≈ signifi cant steroid absorption: carry a steroid card; this recom-
mendation is being widened, and lower doses (beclometasone) are now said to merit
a steroid card (manufacturer’s information).

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Defi nitions COPD is a common progressive disorder characterized by airway ob-
struction (FEV1 <80% predicted; FEV1/FVC <0.7; see p162 and table 4.5) with little or no
reversibility. It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Usually patients have
either COPD or asthma, not both: COPD is favoured by: •age of onset >35yrs •smok-
ing (passive or active) or pollution related38 •chronic dyspnoea •sputum production
•minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variati on. Chronic bronchitis is defi ned clini-
cally as cough, sputum production on most days for 3 months of 2 successive yrs.
Symptoms improve if they stop smoking. There is no excess mortality if lung func-
tion is normal. Emphysema is defi ned histologically as enlarged air spaces distal to
terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT.
Prevalence 10–20% of the over-40s; 2.5≈106 deaths/yr worldwide. 39
Pink puff ers and blue bloaters A traditional division but likely ends of a spec-
trum. Pink puffers: Have alveolar ventilation, a near normal PaO2 and a normal or
low PaCO2. They are breathless but are not cyanosed. They may progress to type I
respiratory failure (p188). Blue bloaters: Have alveolar ventilation, with a low PaO2
and a high PaCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on to develop
cor pulmonale. Their respiratory centres are relatively insensitive to CO2 and they
rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory eff ort (p188)—supplemental oxygen
should be given with care.
Symptoms Cough; sputum; dyspnoea; wheeze. Signs Tachypnoea; use of accessory
muscles of respiration; hyperinfl ation; cricosternal distance (<3cm); expansion;
resonant or hyperresonant percussion note; quiet breath sounds (eg over bullae);
wheeze; cyanosis; cor pulmonale.
Complications Acute exacerbations ± infection; polycythaemia; respiratory failure;
cor pulmonale (oedema; JVP); pneumothorax (ruptured bullae); lung carcinoma.
Tests FBC: PCV. CXR: Hyperinfl ation; fl at hemidiaphragms; large central pulmonary
arteries; peripheral vascular markings; bullae. CT: Bronchial wall thickening; scar-
ring; air space enlargement. ECG: Right atrial and ventricular hypert rophy (cor
pulmonale). ABG: PaO2 ± hypercapnia. Spirometry (p162, p165): obstructive + air
trapping (FEV1 <80% of predicted, FEV1 : FVC ratio <70%, TLC, RV, DLCO in emphy-
sema—see p160). Learn how to do spirometry from an experienced person: ensure
maximal expiration of the full breath (it takes >4s; it’s not a quick puff out).
Treatment Chronic stable: see BOX and fi g 4.14; Emergency : p812. Smoking ces-
sation advice with cordial vigour (p93). Encourage exercise: BMI is often low; diet
advice ± supplements 40 may help (p584). Mucolytics (BNF 3.7) may help chronic pro-
ductive cough (NICE). 41 Disabilities may cause serious, treatable depression; screen
for this (p15). Respiratory failure: p188. Oedema: diuretics. Flu and pneumococcal
vaccinations: p167 and p396.
Long-term O2 therapy (LTOT): An MRC trial showed that if PaO2 was maintained
≥8.0kPa for 15h a day, 3yr survival improved by 50%. UK NICE guidelines suggest
LTOT should be given for: 1 Clinically stable non-smokers with PaO2 <7.3kPa—despite
maximal . These values should be stable on two occasions >3wks apart. 2 If PaO2
7.3–8.0 and pulmonary hypertension (eg RVH; loud S2), or polycythaemia, or peripheral
oedema, or nocturnal hypoxia. 3 O2 can also be prescribed for terminally ill patients.
Severity assessment in COPD
Severity assessment has implications for therapy and prognosis. The BODE index
(Body mass index, airfl ow Obstruction, Dyspnoea and Exercise capacity) helps
predict outcome and number and severity of exacerbations. The Global Initia-
tive for COPD (GOLD) categorizes severity of COPD into four stages (mild, moderate,
severe, and very severe) based on post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted, but it is
not useful for predicting total mortality for 3 years of follow-up and onwards.42

NICE guidance is prepared for the National Health Service in England. All NICE guidance is subject to
regular review and may be updated or withdrawn.
Pulmonary rehabilitation is greatly valued by patients.
• Consider LTOT if PaO2 <7.3kPa (see ‘Long-term O2 therapy’, earlier in topic OPPOSITE).
• Surgery may be appropriate in selected patients, eg recurrent pneumothoraces;
isolated bullous disease. Lung volume reduction/endobronchial valve/transplant.
• NIV may be appropriate if hypercapnic on LTOT.
• NB: air travel is risky if FEV1 <50% or PaO2 <6.7kPa on air.
• Consider palliative care input.
Indications for specialist referral
• Uncertain diagnosis, or suspected severe COPD, or a rapid decline in FEV1.
• Onset of cor pulmonale.
• Bullous lung disease (to assess for surgery).
• Assessment for oral corticosteroids, nebulizer therapy, or LTOT.
• <10 pack-years smoking (= the number of packs/day ≈ years of smoking) or COPD
in patient <40yrs (eg is the cause 1-antitrypsin defi ciency? p290).
• Symptoms disproportionate to lung function tests.
• Frequent infections (to exclude bronchiectasis).
4 Cochrane meta-analyses (2007) of trials (including TORCH) favour steroids + LABA (long-acting -agonist)
vs either alone. LABA alone may exacerbation rates, but no excess hospitalizations or mortality; steroid
inhalers alone are associated with mortality (by 33%) compared with steroids + LABA. 44 Steroid inhalers
may risk of pneumonia, but when combined with LABA, advantages outweigh disadvantages.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
ARDS, or acute lung injury, may be caused by direct lung injury or occur secondary to
severe systemic illness. Lung damage and release of infl ammatory mediators cause
increased capillary permeability and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, often ac-
companied by multiorgan failure.
Causes Pulmonary: Pneumonia; gastric aspiration; inhalation; injury; vasculitis
(p556); contusion. Other: Shock; septicaemia; haemorrhage; multiple transfusions;
DIC (p352); pancreatitis; acute liver failure; trauma; head injury; malaria; fat embo-
lism; burns; obstetric events (eclampsia; amniotic fl uid embolus); drugs/toxins (as-
pirin, heroin, paraquat).
Clinical features Cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; peripheral vasodilation; bilat-
eral fi ne inspiratory crackles. Investigations FBC, U&E, LFT, amylase, clotting, CRP,
blood cultures, ABG. CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates. Pulmonary artery
catheter to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
Diagnostic criteria One consensus requires these four to exist:45 1 Acute onset.
2 CXR: bilateral infi ltrates (fi g 4.15). 3 PCWP <19mmHg or a lack of clinical congestive
heart failure. 4 Refractory hypoxaemia with PaO2: FiO2 <200 for ARDS. Others include
total thoracic compliance <30mL/cmH2O.
Management Admit to ITU; give supportive therapy; treat the underl ying cause.
• Respiratory support: In early ARDS, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
with 40–60% oxygen may be adequate to maintain oxygenation. But most patients
need mechanical ventilation. Indications for ventilation: PaO2: <8.3kPa despite 60%
O2; PaCO2: >6kPa. The large tidal volumes (10–15mL/kg) produced by conventional
ventilation plus reduced lung compliance in ARDS may lead to high peak airway pres-
sures ± pneumothorax. A low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either
low or moderate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improves outcome.
• Circulatory support: Invasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and
Swan–Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and
cardiac output. A conservative fl uid management approach improves outcome.
Maintain cardiac output and O2 delivery with inotropes (eg dobutamine 2.5–10mcg/
kg/min IVI), vasodilators, and blood transfusion. Consider treating pulmonary hyper-
tension with low-dose (20–120 parts per million) nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodila-
tor. Haemo fi ltration may be needed in renal failure and to achieve a negative fl uid
balance. 46, 49
• Sepsis: Identify organism(s) and treat. If septic, but no organisms cultured, use
empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (p167). Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics.
• Other: Nutritional support: enteral is best: p584 & p586, with high-fat, antioxidant
formulations. Steroids protect those at risk of fat embolization and with pneumo-
cystosis and may improve outcome in subacute ARDS. Their role in established ARDS
is controversial. 50, 51
Prognosis Overall mortality is 50–75%. Prognosis varies with age of patient, cause
(pneumonia 86%, trauma 38%), and number of organs involved (three organs in-
volved for >1wk is ‘invariably’ fatal).
Risk factors for ARDS
• Sepsis • Massive transfusion
• Hypovolaemic shock • Burns (p846)
• Trauma • Smoke inhalation (p847)
• Pneumonia • Near drowning
• Diabetic ketoacidosis • Acute pancreatitis
• Gastric aspiration • DIC (p352)
• Pregnancy • Head injury
• Eclampsia • ICP
• Amniotic fl uid embolus • Fat embolus
• Drugs/toxins • Heart/lung bypass
• Paraquat, heroin, aspirin • Tumour lysis syndrome (p529)
• Pulmonary contusion • Malaria.

ARDS over the latter. Remember though that this is a supine projection—the patient is lying fl at

fusions to level out on the posterior chest wall so they will not obscure the costophrenic angles

Respiratory failure
Respiratory failure occurs when gas exchange is inadequate, resulting in hypoxia. It
is defi ned as a PaO2 <8kPa and subdivided into two types according to PaCO2 level.
Type I respiratory failure Defi ned as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with a normal or low
PaCO2. It is caused primarily by ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoventila-
tion, abnormal diff usion, right to left cardiac shunts. Examples of V/Q mismatch:
• Pneumonia.
• Pulmonary oedema.
• PE.
• Asthma.
• Emphysema.
• Pulmonary fi brosis.
• ARDS (p186).
Type II respiratory failure Defi ned as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with hypercapnia
(PaCO2 >6.0kPa). This is caused by alveolar hypoventilation, with or without V/Q mis-
match. Causes include:
• Pulmonary disease: Asthma, COPD, pneumonia, end-stage pulmonary fi brosis, ob-
structive sleep apnoea (OSA, p194).
• Reduced respiratory drive: Sedative drugs, CNS tumour or trauma.
• Neuromuscular disease: Cervical cord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, poliomyeli-
tis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barré syndrome.
• Thoracic wall disease: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis.
Clinical features are those of the underlying cause together with symptoms and
signs of hypoxia, with or without hypercapnia.
Hypoxia: Dyspnoea; restlessness; agitation; confusion; central cyanosis. If long-
standing hypoxia: polycythaemia; pulmonary hypertension; cor pulmonale.
Hypercapnia: Headache; peripheral vasodilation; tachycardia; bounding pulse;
tremor/fl ap; papilloedema; confusion; drowsiness; coma.
Investigations are aimed at determining the underlying cause:
• Blood tests: FBC, U&E, CRP, ABG. See table 4.7.
• Radiology: CXR.
• Microbiology: sputum and blood cultures (if febrile).
• Spirometry (COPD, neuromuscular disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome).
Management Depends on the cause:
Type I respiratory failure:
• Treat underlying cause.
• Give oxygen (24–60%) by facemask.
• Assisted ventilation if PaO2 <8kPa despite 60% O2.
Type II respiratory failure: The respiratory centre may be relatively insensitive to
CO2 and respiration could be driven by hypoxia.
• Treat underlying cause.
• Controlled oxygen therapy: start at 24% O2. Oxygen therapy should be given
with care. Nevertheless, don’t leave the hypoxia untreated.
• Recheck ABG after 20min. If PaCO2 is steady or lower, increase O2 con centration to
28%. If PaCO2 has risen >1.5kPa and the patient is still hypoxic, consider assisted
ventilation (eg NIPPV, p813, ie non-invasive positive pressure ventilation).
• If this fails, consider intubation and ventilation, if appropriate.
When to consider ABG (arterial blood gas) measurement
• Any unexpected deterioration in an ill patient. (Technique: see p771.)
• Anyone with an acute exacerbation of a chronic chest condition.
• Anyone with impaired consciousness or impaired respiratory eff ort.
• Signs of CO2 retention, eg bounding pulse, drowsy, tremor (fl apping), headache.
• Cyanosis, confusion, visual hallucinations (signs of PaO2; SAO2 is an alternative).
• To validate measurements from transcutaneous pulse oximetry (p162).

ABG interpretation
Normal pH is 7.35–7.45. pH <7.35 indicates acidosis and >7.45 indicates alkalosis.
If the pCO is in keeping with the pH, the problem is likely to be a respiratory
2
problem (eg high pCOand pH <7.35 = likely a respiratory acidosis). If the HCOΩ
2 3
is in keeping with the pH, this is suggestive of a metabolic problem (eg high
HCOΩ and pH > 7.45 = metabolic alkalosis).
3
Table 4.7 Interpreting blood gas analysis
pH PaCO HCOΩ
2 3
Metabolic acidosis Low Normal/low Low
Respiratory acidosis Low High Normal/high
Metabolic alkalosis High Normal/high High
Respiratory alkalosis High Low Normal/low
Steps to ABG interpretation:
1 pH: acidosis or alkalosis?
2 pCO: high/low? Does this fi t with the pH? (if yes, think respiratory problem)
2
3 HCOΩ: high/low? Does this fi t with pH? (if yes, think metabolic problem)
3
4 PO: is this normal given the FiO (fraction of inspired oxygen)?
2 2
5 Is there any compensation? (i.e. changes in PCO/HCOΩ to try and correct an un-
2 3
derlying imbalance). Is this partial (pH abnormal) or complete (pH normalized)?
6 Calculate the anion gap. Helpful in working out aetiology of metabolic acidosis.
Anion gap: (Na+ + K+) Ω (ClΩ + HCOΩ)
3
See p670 for causes of raised anion gap (normal 10–18mmol/L).
Administering oxygen
Oxygen should be prescribed. Titrate the amount guided by the patient’s SaO2 and
clinical condition. Humidifi cation is only required for longer-term delivery of O2 at
high fl ow rates and tracheostomies, but may  expectoration in bronchiectasis.
Nasal cannulae: Preferred by patients, but O2 delivery is relatively imprecise and
may cause nasal soreness. The fl ow rate (1–4L/min) roughly defi nes the concentra-
tion of O2 (24–40%). May be used to maintain SaO2 when nebulizers need to be run
using air, eg COPD.
Simple face mask: Delivers a variable amount of O2 depending on the rate of
infl ow. Less precise than venturi masks—so don’t use if hypercapnia or type II
respiratory failure. Risk of CO2 accumulation (within the mask and so in inspired
gas) if fl ow rate <5L/min. Be careful in those with COPD (p812).
Venturi mask: Provides a precise percentage or fraction of O2 (FiO2) at high fl ow
rates. Start at 24–28% in COPD. Colours of masks:
BLUE = 24%, WHITE = 28%, YELLOW = 35%, RED = 40%, GREEN = 60%.
Non-rebreathing mask: These have a reservoir bag and deliver high concentra-
tions of O2 (60–90%), determined by the infl ow (10–15L/min) and the presence of
fl ap valves on the side. They are commonly used in emergencies, but are imprecise
and should be avoided in those requiring controlled O2 therapy.
Promoting oxygenation: Other ways to  oxygenation to reach the target SaO2
(this should be given as a number on the drug chart):
• Treat anaemia (transfuse if essential).
• Improve cardiac output (treat heart failure).
• Chest physio to improve ventilation/perfusion mismatch.

Pulmonary embolism (PE)
Causes PES usually arise from a venous thrombosis in the pelvis or legs. Clots break
off and pass through the veins and the right side of the heart before lodging in
the pulmonary circulation. Rare causes: RV thrombus (post-MI); septic emboli (right-
sided endocarditis); fat, air, or amniotic fl uid embolism; neoplastic cells; parasites.
Risk factors
• Recent surgery, especially abdominal/pelvic or hip/knee replacement.
• Thrombophilia, eg antiphospholipid syndrome (p374).
• Leg fracture.
• Prolonged bed rest/reduced mobility.
• Malignancy.
• Pregnancy/postpartum; combined contraceptive pill; HRT (lower risk).
• Previous PE.
Clinical features Small emboli may be asymptomatic, whereas large emboli are
often fatal. Symptoms: Acute breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis; diz-
ziness; syncope. Ask about risk factors, past history or family history of thromboem-
bolism. Signs: Pyrexia; cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; hypotension; raised JVP;
pleural rub; pleural eff usion. Look for signs of a cause, eg deep vein thrombosis.
Tests
• FBC, U&E, baseline clotting, D-dimers (BOX).
• ABG may show PaO2 and PaCO2.
• Imaging: CXR may be normal, or show oligaemia of aff ected segment, dilated pul-
monary artery, linear atelectasis, small pleural eff usion, wedge-shaped opacities or
cavitation (rare). CTPA—see fi g 4.16.
• ECG may be normal, or show tachycardia, right bundle branch block, right vent-
ricular strain (inverted T in V1 to V4). The classical SI QIII TIII pattern (p98) is rare.
Further investigations are shown on p818.
Treatment See p818. If haemodynamically unstable, thrombolyse for massive
PE (alteplase 10mg IV over 1min, then 90mg IVI over 2h; max 1 . 5mg/kg if <65kg).
Haemodynamically stable: start LMWH or unfractionated heparin if underlying renal
impairment and treat for 5 days. Then, start DOAC (direct oral anticoagulant) or war-
farin (p350). For warfarin, stop heparin when INR is 2–3, due to intial prothrombotic
eff ect of warfarin (target INR of 2–3). Consider placement of a vena caval fi lter if
contra-indication to anticoagulation.
Unprovoked PE In patients with no known provoking risk factors, consider inves-
tigation for possible underlying malignany. Undertake full history, examination
(including breast), CXR, FBC, calcium, LFTS, urinalysis. Patients >40yrs consider abdo-
pelvic CT and mammography in women. Consider antiphospholipid and thrombo-
philia testing if family history positive (p374).
Prevention Give heparin to all immobile patients. Stop HRT and the combined con-
traceptive pill pre-op (if reliable with another form of contraception).
Pneumothorax
Caus es Often spontaneous (especially in young, thin men) due to rupture of a sub-
pleural bulla. Other causes: asthma; COPD; TB; pneumonia; lung abscess; carcinoma;
cystic fi brosis; lung fi brosis; sarcoidosis; connective tissue disorders (Marfan’s syn.,
Ehlers–Danlos syn.), trauma; iatrogenic (subclavian CVP line insertion, pleural aspira-
tion/biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, liver biopsy, +ve pressure ventilation).
Clinical features Symptoms: May be asymptomatic (fi t, young, and small pneumo-
thorax) or there may be sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Pa-
tients with asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically
ventilated patients may present with hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures.
Signs: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath
sounds on the aff ected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi-
ated away from the aff ected side, p749, p815. Management: See p815.

Investigating suspected PE
Diagnosis of PE is improved by adopting a stepwise approach, combining an objec-
tive probability score, with subsequent investigations, as follows.
Assess the clinical probability of a PE: Many systems exist and one of the most
frequently used is the modifi ed Wells Criteria (table 4.8).

• Malignancy: continue treatment with LMWH for 6 months or until
cure of cancer
• Pregnancy: LMWH is continued until delivery/end of pregnancy
Fig 4.16 Investigation and management of PE.
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS)
Oral alternatives to warfarin (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) have
been available for treatment of PE since NICE approval in 2012. They have a rapid
onset of action (without the need for LMWH overlap) and can be administered in
fi xed doses without the need for continuous monitoring. Monitoring is required
to assess compliance, side eff ects (eg bleeding), and presence of VTE. Antidotes
for DOACS are becoming available and in the USA idarucizumab is already licensed.

Pleural eff usion
Defi nitions A pleural eff usion is fl uid in the pleural space. Eff usions can be divided
by their protein concentration into transudates (<25g/L) and exudates (>35g/L), see
BOX. Blood in the pleural space is a haemothorax, pus in the pleural space is an em-
pyema, and chyle (lymph with fat) is a chylothorax. Both blood and air in the pleural
space is called a haemopneumothorax.
Causes Transudates may be due to venous pressure (cardiac failure, constrictive
pericarditis, fl uid overload), or hypoproteinaemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, mal-
absorption). Also occur in hypothyroidism and Meigs’ syndrome (right pleural eff usion
and ovarian fi broma). Exudates are mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural cap-
illaries secondary to infection, infl ammation, or malignancy. Causes: pneumonia; TB;
pulmonary infarction; rheumatoid arthritis; SLE; bronchogenic carcin oma; malignant
metastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitis carcinomatosis.
Symptoms Asymptomatic—or dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain.
Signs Decreased expansion; stony dull percussion note; diminished breath sounds
occur on the aff ected side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are  (incon-
stant and unreliable). Above the eff usion, where lung is compressed, there may be
bronchial breathing. With large eff usions there may be tracheal deviation away
from the eff usion. Look for aspiration marks and signs of associated disease: ma-
lignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar);
stigmata of chronic liver disease; cardiac failure; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthri-
tis; butterfl y rash of SLE.
Tests CXR: Small eff usions blunt the costophrenic angles, larger ones are seen as
water-dense shadows with concave upper borders. A completely fl at horizontal up-
per border implies that there is also a pneumothorax.
Ultrasound is useful in identifying the presence of pleural fl uid and in guiding diag-
nostic or therapeutic aspiration.
Diagnostic aspiration: Percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose
a site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (don’t go too low or you’ll be in the abdo-
men!). Infi ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle
to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids
neurovascular bundle). Draw off 10–30mL of pleural fl uid and send it to the lab for
clinical chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amylase), bacteriology (microscopy
and culture, auramine stain, TB culture), cytology, and, if indicated, immunology
(rheumatoid factor, ANA, complement). See table 4.9.
Pleural biopsy: If pleural fl uid analysis is inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy.
Thoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling
direct visualization of the pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas).
Management is of the underlying cause.
• Drainage: If the eff usion is symptomatic, drain it, repeatedly if necessary. Fluid
is best removed slowly (0.5–1.5L/24h). It may be aspirated in the same way as a
diagnostic tap, or using an intercostal drain (see p766).
• Pleurodesis with talc may be helpful for recurrent eff usions. Thorascopic mechani-
cal pleurodesis is most eff ective for malignant eff usions. Empyemas (p170) are best
drained using a chest drain, inserted under ultrasound or CT guidance.
• Intra-pleural alteplase and dornase alfa may help with empyema.
• Surgery: Persistent collections and increasing pleural thickness (on ultrasound)
requires surgery. 50

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome
This disorder is characterized by intermittent closure/collapse of the pharyngeal
air way causing apnoeic episodes during sleep. These are terminated by partial
arousal.
Clinical features The typical patient is an obese, middle-aged man who presents
because of snoring or daytime somnolence. His partner often describes apnoeic epi-
sodes during sleep.
• Loud snoring.
• Daytime somnolence.
• Poor sleep quality.
• Morning headache.
• Decreased libido.
• Nocturia.
• Cognitive performance.
Complications Pulmonary hypertension; type II respiratory failure (p188). Sleep
apnoea is also reported as an independent risk factor for hypertension. 51
Investigations Simple studies (eg pulse oximetry, video recordings) may be all that
are required for diagnosis. Polysomnography (which monitors oxygen saturation,
airfl ow at the nose and mouth, ECG, EMG chest, and abdominal wall movement during
sleep) is diagnostic. The occurrence of 15 or more episodes of apnoea or hypopnoea
during 1h of sleep, on average, indicates signifi cant sleep apnoea.
Management
• Weight reduction.
• Avoidance of tobacco and alcohol.
• Mandibular advancement device.
• CPAP via a nasal mask during sleep is eff ective and recommended by NICE for those
with moderate to severe disease. 52
• Surgery to relieve pharyngeal or nasal obstruction, eg tonsillectomy or polypectomy,
is occasionally needed.
Cor pulmonale
Cor pulmonale is right heart failure caused by chronic pulmonary arterial hyperten-
sion. Causes include chronic lung disease, pulmonary vascular disorders, and neuro-
muscular and skeletal diseases (see BOX).
Clinical features Symptoms include dyspnoea, fatigue, and syncope. Signs: cya-
nosis; tachycardia; raised JVP with prominent a and v waves; RV heave; loud P2, pan-
systolic murmur (tricuspid regurgitation); early diastolic Graham Steell murmur;
hepatomegaly and oedema.
Investigations FBC: Hb and haematocrit  (secondary polycythaemia). ABG: hypoxia,
with or without hypercapnia. CXR: enlarged right atrium and ventricle, prominent
pulmonary arteries (see fi g 4.17). ECG: P pulmonale; right axis deviation; right ven-
tricular hypert rophy/strain.
Management
• Treat underlying cause—eg COPD and pulmonary infections.
• Treat respiratory failure—in the acute situation give 24% oxygen if PaO2 <8kPa.
Monitor ABG and gradually increase oxygen concentration if PaCO2 is stable (p188).
In COPD patients, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for 16h/d increases survival (p184).
Patients with chronic hypoxia when clinically stable should be assessed for LTOT.
• Treat cardiac failure with diuretics such as furosemide, eg 40–160mg/24h PO. Moni-
tor U&E and give amiloride or potassium supplements if necessary. Alternative:
spironolactone.
• Consider venesection if haematocrit >55%.
• Consider heart–lung transplantation in young patients.
Prognosis Poor. 50% die within 5yrs.

Sarcoidosis
A multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown cause. Prevalence highest in
Northern Europe, eg UK: 10–20/105 population. Usually aff ects adults aged 20–40yrs,
more common in women. African–Caribbeans are aff ected more frequently and
more severely than Caucasians, particularly by extra-thoracic disease. Associated
with HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. For other causes of granuloma see table 4.10.
Clinical features In 20–40%, the disease is discovered incidentally, after a routine
CXR, and is thus asymptomatic. Acute sarcoidosis often presents with fever, erythe-
ma nodosum (fi g 12.21, p563),6 polyarthralgia, and bilateral hilar lymphodenopathy
(BHL), also called Löfgren syndrome, which usually resolves spontaneously.
Pulmonary disease: 90% have abnormal CXRs with BHL (fi g 4.18) ± pulmonary infi l-
trates or fi brosis; see later in topic for staging. Symptoms: Dry cough, progressive
dyspnoea, exercise tolerance, and chest pain. In 10–20%, symptoms progress, with
concurrent deterioration in lung function.
Non-pulmonary signs: These are legion: lymphadenopathy; hepatomegaly; sple-
nomegaly; uveitis; conjunctivitis; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; glaucoma; terminal
phalangeal bone cysts; enlargement of lacrimal & parotid glands (fi g 8.49, p355);
Bell’s palsy; neuropathy; meningitis; brainstem and spinal syndromes; space-occupy-
ing lesion; erythema nodosum (fi g 12.21, p563); lupus pernio; subcutaneous nodules;
cardio myopathy; arrhythmias; hypercalcaemia; hypercalciuria; renal stones; pitui-
tary dysfunction.
Tests Blood: ESR, lymphopenia, LFT, serum ACE in ~60% (non-specifi c), Ca2+,
immun oglobulins. 24h urine: Ca2+. CXR is abnormal in 90%: Stage 0: normal. Stage
1: BHL. Stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary infi ltrates. Stage 3: peripheral pulmonary
infi ltrates alone. Stage 4: progressive pulmonary fi brosis; bulla formation (honey-
combing); pleural involvement. ECG may show arrhythmias or bundle branch block.
Lung function tests may be normal or show reduced lung volumes, impaired gas
transfer, and a restrictive ventilatory defect. Tissue biopsy (lung, liver, lymph nodes,
skin nodules, or lacrimal glands) is diagnostic and shows non-caseating granulo-
mata.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): Shows lymphocytes in active disease; neutrophils
with pulmonary fi brosis. Transbrochial biopsy: May be diagnostic.
Ultrasound: May show nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly.
Bone X-rays: Show ‘punched out’ lesions in terminal phalanges.
CT/MRI: May be useful in assessing severity of pulmonary disease or diagnosing
neurosarcoidosis. Ophthalmology assessment (slit lamp examination, fl uorescein
angiography) is indicated in ocular disease.
Management Patients with BHL alone don’t need treatment as most recover spon-
taneously.53, 54 Acute sarcoidosis: bed rest, NSAIDS.
Indications for corticosteroids:
• Parenchymal lung disease (symptomatic, static, or progressive).
• Uveitis.
• Hypercalcaemia.
• Neurological or cardiac involvement.
Prednisolone (40mg/24h) PO for 4–6 wks, then dose over 1yr according to clinical
status. A few patients relapse and may need a further course or long-term therapy.
Other therapy: In severe illness, IV methylprednisolone or immunos uppressants
(methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide) may be needed.
Anti-TNF therapy may be tried in refractory cases, or lung transplantation.
Prognosis 60% of patients with thoracic sarcoidosis resolve over 2yrs. 20% respond
to steroid therapy; in the rest, improvement is unlikely despite therapy.7
6 A detailed history and exam (including for synovitis) + CXR, 2 ASO (antistreptolysin-O) titres and a tuber-
culin skin test are usually enough to diagnose erythema nodosum.
7 ACE is also  in: hyperthyroidism, Gaucher’s, silicosis, TB, hypers ensitivity pneumonitis, asb es tosis, pneu-
mocystosis.55 ACE levels in CSF help diagnose CNS sarcoidosis (when serum ACE may be normal).56 ACE is lower
in: Caucasians; and anorexia.57

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)
This is the generic term used to describe a number of conditions that primarily af-
fect the lung parenchyma in a diff use manner.58 They are characterized by chronic
infl ammation and/or progressive interstitial fi brosis (table 4.11), and share a number
of clinical and pathological features. See table 4.11 and fi g 4.19.
Clinical features Dyspnoea on exertion; non-productive paroxysmal cough; ab-
normal breath sounds; abnormal CXR or high-resolution CT; restrictive pulmonary
spirometry with DLCO (p164).
Pathological features Fibrosis and remodelling of the interstitium; chronic infl am-
mation; hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes.
Classifi cation The ILDS can be broadly grouped into three categories:
Those with known cause, eg:
• Occupational/environmental, eg asbestosis, berylliosis, silicosis, cotton worker’s
lung (byssinosis).
• Drugs, eg nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan.
• Hypersensitivity reactions, eg hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
• Infections, eg TB, fungi, viral.
• Gastro-oesophageal refl ux.
Those associated with systemic disorders, eg:
• Sarcoidosis.
• Rheumatoid arthritis.
• SLE, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome.
• Ulcerative colitis, renal tubular acidosis, autoimmune thyroid disease.
Idiopathic, eg:
• Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF, p200).
• Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.
• Non-specifi c interstitial pneumonitis.
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)
In sensitized individuals, repetitive inhalation of allergens (fungal spores or avian
proteins) provokes a hypersensitivity reaction which varies in intensity and clini-
cal course depending on the antigen. In the acute phase, the alveoli are infi ltrated
with acute infl ammatory cells. Early diagnosis and prompt allergen removal can halt
and reverse disease progression, so prognosis can be good. With chronic exposure,
granuloma formation and obliterative bronchiolitis occur.
Causes
• Bird-fancier’s and pigeon-fancier’s lung (proteins in bird droppings).
• Farmer’s and mushroom worker’s lung (Micropolyspora faeni, Thermoactino-
myces vulgaris).
• Malt worker’s lung (Aspergillus clavatus).
• Bagassosis or sugar worker’s lung (Thermoactinomyces sacchari ).
Clinical features 4–6h post-exposure: Fever, rigors, myalgia, dry cough, dyspnoea,
fi ne bibasal crackles. Chronic: Finger clubbing (50%), increasing dyspnoea, weight,
exertional dyspnoea, type I respiratory failure, cor pulmonale.
Tests Acute: Blood: FBC (neutrophilia); ESR; ABGS; serum antibodies (may indicate
exposure/previous sensitization rather than disease). CXR: upper-zone mottling/con-
solidation; hilar lymph adenopathy (rare). Lung function tests: Reversible restrictive
defect; reduced gas transfer during acute attacks. Chronic: Blood tests: serum anti-
bodies. CXR: upper-zone fi brosis; honeycomb lung. CT chest: nodules, ground glass ap-
pearance, extensive fi brosis. Lung function tests: restrictive defect. Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fl uid shows lymphocytes and mast cells.
Management Acute: Remove allergen and give O2 (35–60%), PO prednisolone
(40mg/24h PO), reducing course. Chronic: Allergen avoidance, or wear a facemask
or +ve pressure helmet. Long-term steroids often achieve CXR and physiological im-
provement. Compens ation (UK Industrial Injuries Act) may be payable.

Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF)
This is a type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Infl ammatory cell infi ltrate and
pulmonary fi brosis of unknown cause. It is the commonest cause of interstitial lung
disease.
Symptoms Dry cough; exertional dyspnoea; malaise; weight; arthralgia.
Signs Cyanosis; fi nger clubbing; fi ne end-inspiratory crepitations.
Complications Respiratory failure; risk of lung cancer.
Tests Blood: ABG (PaO2; if severe, PaCO2); CRP; immunoglobulins; ANA (30% +ve),
rheumatoid factor (10% +ve). Imaging: (fi g 4.20) Lung volume; bilateral lower zone
reticulo-nodular shadows; honeycomb lung (advanced disease). CT: Shows similar
changes to the CXR but is more sensitive and is an essential for diagnosis. Spirom-
etry: Restrictive (p162); transfer factor. BAL: May indicate activity of alveolitis:
lymphocytes (good response/prognosis) or neutrophils and eosinophils (poor
response/prognosis). 99TCm-DTPA scan: (diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid) May
refl ect disease activity.59 Lung biopsy: May be needed for diagnosis. The histological
changes observed on biopsy are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).
Management Supportive care: oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, opiates, palliative
care input. All patients should be considered for current clinical trials or lung trans-
plantation. 60 It is strongly recommended that high-dose steroids are not used except
where the diagnosis of IPF is in doubt.
Prognosis 50% 5yr survival rate (range 1–20yrs).
A new treatment emerges for suff erers of IPF
Nintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to slow disease progression and off er
some hope to suff erers of IPF. Pirfenidone, an immunosuppressant and antifi brotic
agent, showed a reduction in the rate of lung scarring and has been shown to improve
life expectancy compared to best supportive care.61 Nintedanib targets three growth
factor receptors involved in pulmonary fi brosis.

Industrial dust diseases
Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis (CWP) A common dust disease in countries that
have or have had underground coal-mines. It results from inhalation of coal dust par-
ticles (1–3μm in diameter) over 15–20yrs. These are ingested by macrophages which
die, releasing their enzymes and causing fi brosis.
Clinical features: Asymptomatic, but coexisting chronic bronchitis is common. CXR:
many round opacities (1–10mm), especially in upper zone.
Management: Avoid exposure to coal dust; treat co-existing chronic bronchitis;
claim compensation (in the UK, via the Industrial Injuries Act).
Progressive massive fi brosis (PMF) Due to progression of CWP, which causes pro-
gressive dyspnoea, fi brosis, and, eventually, cor pulmonale. CXR: usually bilateral,
upper-mid zone fi brotic masses (1–10cm), develop from periphery towards hilum.
Management: Avoid exposure to coal dust; claim compensation (as for CWP).
Caplan’s syndrome The association between rheumatoid arthritis, pneumoc oniosis,
and pulmonary rheumatoid nodules.
Silicosis (See fi g 4.21.) Caused by inhalation of silica particles, which are very fi bro-
genic. A number of jobs may be associated with exposure, eg metal mining, stone
quarrying, sandblasting, and pottery/ceramic manufacture.
Clinical features: Progressive dyspnoea, incidence of TB, CXR shows diff use miliary
or nodular pattern in upper and mid-zones and egg-shell calcifi cation of hilar nodes.
Spirometry: restrictive ventilatory defect.
Management: Avoid exposure to silica; claim compensation (as for CWP).
Asbestosis Caused by inhalation of asbestos fi bres. Asbestos was commonly used
in the building trade for fi re proofi ng, pipe lagging, electrical wire insulation, and
roofi ng felt. Degree of asbestos exposure is related to degree of pulmonary fi brosis.
Clinical features: Similar to other fi brotic lung diseases with progressive dyspnoea,
clubbing, and fi ne end-inspiratory crackles. Also causes pleural plaques, risk of
bronchial adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma.
Management: Symptomatic. Patients are often eligible for compensation through
the UK Industrial Injuries Act.
Mesothelioma See p174.

The essence of endocrinology
For scientists
• Defi ne a syndrome, and match it to a gland malfunction.
• Measure the gland’s output in the peripheral blood. Defi ne clinical syndromes
associated with too much or too little secretion (hyper- and hypo-syndromes,
respectively; eu- means normal, neither  nor , as in euthyroid). Note factors that
may make measurement variable, eg diurnal release of cortisol.
• If suspecting hormone defi ciency, test by stimulating the gland that produces it
(eg short ACTH stimulation test or Synacthen® test in Addison’s). If the gland is
not functioning normally, there will be a blunted response to stimulation.
• If suspecting hormone excess, test by inhibiting the gland that produces it (eg
dexamethasone suppression test in Cushing’s). If there is a hormone-secreting
tumour then this will fail to suppress via normal feedback mechanisms.
• Find a way to image the gland. NB: non-functioning tumours or ‘incidentalomas’
may be found in health, see p224. Imaging alone does not make the diagnosis.
• Aim to halt disease progression; diet and exercise can stop progression of im-
paired fasting glucose to frank diabetes. 1, 2 For other glands, halting progression
will depend on understanding autoimmunity, and the interaction of genes and
environment. In thyroid autoimmunity (an archetypal autoimmune disease), it
is possible to track interactions between genes and environment (eg smoking
and stress) via expression of immuno logically active molecules (HLA class I and
II, adhesion molecules, cytokines, CD40, and complement regulatory proteins). 3
Endocrinologists love this reductionist approach, but have been less successful
at understanding emergent phenomena—those properties and performances of
ours that cannot be predicted from full knowledge of our perturbed parts. We
understand the diurnal nature of cortisol secretion, for example, but the science
of relating this to dreams, the consolidation of memory, and the psychopathology
of families and other groups (such as the endocrinology ward round you may be
about to join) is in its infancy. But as doctors we are steeped in the hormonal lives
of patients (as they are in ours)—and we may as well start by recognizing this now.
For those doing exams
‘What’s wrong with him?’ your examiner asks, boldly. While you apologize to
the patient for this rudeness by asking, ‘Is it alright if we speak about you as if
you weren’t here?’, think to yourself that if you were a betting man or woman
you would wager that the diagnosis will be endocrinological. In no other disci-
pline are gestalt impressions so characteristic. To get good at recognizing these
conditions, spend time in endocrinology outpatients and looking at collections
of clinical photographs. Also, specifi c cutaneous signs are important, as follows.
Thyrotoxicosis: Hair loss; pretibial myxoedema (confusing term, p218); onycho-
lysis (nail separation from the nailbed); bulging eyes (exophthalmos/proptosis).
Hypothyroidism: Hair loss; eyebrow loss; cold, pale skin; characteristic face. You
might, perhaps should, fail your exam if you blurt out ‘Toad-like face’.
Cushing’s syndrome: Central obesity and wasted limbs (=‘lemon
on sticks’ see fi g 5.2); moon face; buff alo hump; supraclavicular fat
pads; striae.
Addison’s disease: Hyperpigmentation (face, neck, palmar creases).
Acromegaly: Acral (distal) + soft tissue overgrowth; big jaws (macro-
gnathia), hands and feet; the skin is thick; facial features are coarse.
Hyperandrogenism (): Hirsutism; temporal balding; acne.
Hypopituitarism: Pale or yellow tinged thinned skin, resulting in
fi ne wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, making the patient look
older.
Hypoparathyroidism: Dry, scaly, puff y skin; brittle nails; coarse hair. Fig 5.2 ‘Lemon
on sticks.’
Pseudohypoparathyroidism: Short stature, short neck, and short
4th and 5th metacarpals.

Endocrine physiology
Hormones are chemical messengers which act directly on nearby cells (paracrine
eff ect), on the cell of origin (autocrine eff ect), at a distant site (endocrine eff ect), or
as neurotransmitters (brain and gastrointestinal tract). Thirst, thermal regulation,
appetite, sleep cycles, menstrual cycle, and stress/mood are all controlled by the
hypothalamus. Releasing factors produced by the hypothalamus reach the pituitary
via the portal system (pituitary stalk), see fi g 5.3. The releasing factors stimulate or
inhibit the production of hormones from the anterior pituitary, fi g 5.4. Vasopressin
and oxytocin are produced in the hypothalamus and stored and released from the
posterior pituitary.

Diabetes mellitus (DM): classifi cation and diagnosis
DM results from lack, or reduced eff ectiveness, of endogenous insulin. Hyperglycae-
mia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious
microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems:
stroke, MI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia. So think of DM as a vascular dis-
ease:1 adopt a holistic approach and consider other cardiovascular risk factors too.
Categories of diabetes and dyslipidaemia
Type 1 DM: Usually adolescent onset but may occur at any age. Cause: insulin de-
fi ciency from autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic  cells. Pa-
tients must have insulin, and are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss. Associated
with other autoimmune diseases (>90% HLA DR3 ± DR4). Concordance is only ~30% in
identical twins, indica ting environmental infl uence. Four genes are important: one
(6q) determines islet sensitivity to damage (eg from viruses or cross-reactivity from
cows’ milk-induced antibodies). Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a
form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life.
Type 2 DM: (Formerly non-insulin-dependent DM, NIDDM) is at ‘epidemic’ levels in many
places, mainly due to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and
improved long evity.4 Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%).
Most are over 40yrs, but teenagers are now getting type 2 DM (OHCS p156). Cause:
insulin secretion ± insulin resistance. It is associated with obesity, lack of exercise,
calorie and alcohol excess. 80% concordance in identical twins, indicating stronger
genetic infl uence than in type 1 DM. Typically progresses from a preliminary phase of
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). (This is a unique
window for lifestyle intervention.) Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a
rare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM aff ecting young people.
Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): Fasting plasma glucose <7mmol/L and OGTT (oral
glucose tolerance) 2h glucose ≥7.8mmol/L but <11.1mmol/L.
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1mmol/L but <7mmol/L
(WHO criteria). Do an OGTT to exclude DM. The cut-off point is somewhat arbitrary.
IGT and IFG denote diff erent abnormalities of glucose regulation (post-prandial and
fasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both
with lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG and HbA1C at high
end of normal (37–46mmol/mol) is ~25%.5
Other causes of DM Steroids; anti-HIV drugs; newer antipsychotics.
• Pancreatic: pancreatitis; surgery (where >90% pancreas is removed); trauma;
pancreatic destruction (haemochromatosis, cystic fi brosis); pancreatic cancer.
• Cushing’s disease; acromegaly; phaeochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; pregnancy.
• Others: congenital lipodystrophy; glycogen storage diseases.
Metabolic syndrome (syndrome x) Defi nition from International Diabetes Federa-
tion: central obesity (BMI >30, or  waist circ, ethnic-specifi c values), plus two of BP ≥130/85,
triglycerides ≥1.7mmol/L, HDL ≤ 1.03/1.29mmol/L, fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or
type 2 DM. ~20% are aff ected; weight, genetics, and insulin resistance important in aetiol-
ogy. Vascular events—but probably not beyond the combined eff ect of individual risk
factors. : Exercise; weight; treat individual components.
1 Chicken or egg? Most type 2 diabetes-associated genes have a function in the vasculature, and stre ss in
-cells can result from vascular defects in the pancreas, so maybe vascular events trigger DM.6

Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: WHO criteria (rather arbitrary!)
• Symptoms of hyperglycaemia (eg polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss,
visual blurring, genital thrush, lethargy) AND raised venous glucose detected
once—fasting ≥7mmol/L or random ≥11.1mmol/L OR
• Raised venous glucose on two separate occasions—fasting ≥7mmol/L, random
≥11.1mmol/L or oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)—2h value ≥11.1mmol/L
• HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol. Avoid in pregnancy, children, type 1 DM, and haemoglobi-
nopathies.
Whenever you have a needle in a vein, do a blood glucose (unless recently done);
note if fasting or not. Non-systematic, but better than urine tests (false Ωves).
Diff erentiating type 1 and 2 diabetes
Occasionally it may be diffi cult to diff erentiate whether a patient has type 1 or 2
DM, although they can present diff erently (see table 5.1). Features of type 1 include
weight loss; persistent hyper glycaemia despite diet and medications; presence of
autoantibodies: islet cell antibodies (ICA) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase
(GAD) antibodies; ketonuria.
Table 5.1 Diff erences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes
Type 1 DM Type 2 DM
Epidemiology Often starts before puberty Older patients (usually)
Genetics HLA D3 and D4 linked No HLA association
Cause Autoimmune -cell destruction Insulin resistance/-cell dysfunction
Presentation Polydipsia, polyuria, weight, ketosis Asymptomatic/complications, eg MI
Not all new-onset DM in older people is type 2: if ketotic ± a poor response to oral hy-
poglycaemics (and patient is slim or has a family or personal history of autoimmunity),
think of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and measure islet cell antibodies.
What is the best diet for obese patients with type 2 diabetes?
Dietary carbohydrate is a big determinant of postprandial glucose levels, and
low-carbohydrate diets improve glycaemic control. How do low-carbohydrate, ke-
togenic diets (<20g of carbohydrate daily; LCKD) compare with low-glycaemic in-
dex, reduced-calorie diet (eg 500kcal/day defi cit from weight maintenance diet)?
In one randomized study over 24 weeks, LCKD had greater improvements in HbA1c
(Ω15 vs Ω5mmol/L), weight (Ω11kg vs Ω7kg), and HDL. Diabetes drugs were reduced
or eliminated in 95% of LCKD vs 62% of LGID participants.6 NB: eff ects on renal func-
tion and mortality are unknown so these diets remain controversial.
Monitoring glucose control
1 Fingerprick glucose if on insulin (type 1/2). NB: before a meal informs about
long-acting insulin doses; after meals inform about the dose of short-acting
insulin.
2 Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relates to mean glucose level over previous
8wks (RBC t½). Targets are negotiable, eg 48–57mmol/mol (depends on pa-
tient’s wish and arterial risk, eg past MI or stroke). If at risk from the eff ects of
hypoglycaemia, eg elderly patients prone to falls, consider less tight control.
Tight control may not alter all-cause mortality.7 Complications rise with rising
HbA1c, so any improvement helps.
3 Be sure to ask about hypoglycaemic attacks (and whether symptomatic).
Hypoglycaemic awareness may diminish if control is too tight, or with time
in type 1 DM, due to glucagon secretion. It may return if control is loosened.

Treating diabetes mellitus
General Focus on education and lifestyle advice (eg exercise to insulin sensitiv-
ity), healthy eating: p244—saturated fats, sugar, starch-carbohydrate, modera te
prot ein. Foods made just for diabetics are not needed. One could regard bariatric
surgery as a cure for DM in selected patients. Be prepared to negotiate HbA1c target
and review every 3–6 months. Assess global vascular risk; start a high-intensity sta-
tin (p115), eg atorvastatin as tolerated, control BP (p211). Give foot-care (p212). (Pre-)
pregnancy care should be in a multidisciplinary clinic (OHCS p23). Advise informing
DVLA and not to drive if hypoglycaemic spells (p159; loss of hypog lycaemia awareness
may lead to loss of licence; permanent if HGV).
Type 1 DM Insulin (see BOX ‘Using insulin’).
Type 2 DM See fi g 5.5.
Lifestyle modifi cation
Diet, weight control, exercise
Monotherapy
1st-line standard release metformin
If HbA1C rises to 58mmol/mol, consider dual therapy with:
1 Metformin+ DPP4 inhibitor (eg sitagliptin)
2 Metformin and pioglitazone
3 Metformin and sulphonylurea (SU)
4 Metformin andS GLT-2i (glifazon)
If HbA1C rises to 58mmol/mol, triple therapy with:
1 Metformin,D PP4 inhibitor, + SU
2 Metformin, pioglitazone,+ SU
3 Metformin,S U/pioglitazone, + SGLT-2i
4 Insulin-based therapy
Insulin: see BOX ‘Using insulin’. Use Triple therapy not tolerated:
a structured programme. Review the metformin, SU and GLP 1 mimetic
need for existing oral treatments. (see BOX ‘GLP analogues’).

Oral hypoglycaemic agents
Metformin: A biguanide.  insulin sensitivity and helps weight. SE: nausea; diarrhoea
(try modifi ed-release version); abdominal pain; not hypoglycaemia. Avoid if eGFR
36mL/min (due to risk lactic acidosis).
DPP4 inhibitors/gliptins: (Eg sitagliptin.) Block the action of DPP-4, an enzyme which
destroys the hormone incretin.
Glitazone:  insulin sensitivity; SE: hypo glycaemia, fractures, fl uid retention, LFT (do
LFT every 8wks for 1yr, stop if ALT up >3-fold). CI: past or present CCF; osteoporosis;
monitor weight, and stop if  or oedema.
Sulfonylurea:  insulin secretion; eg gliclazide 40mg/d. SE: hypoglycaemia (moni-
tor glucose); it  weight.
SGLTI: Selective sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Blocks the reabsorp-
tion of glucose in the kidneys and promotes excretion of excess glucose in the
urine (eg empaglifl ozin, shown to reduce mortality from cardiovascular disease in
patients with type 2 DM, when compared to placebo).8

Using insulin
Vital to educate to self-adjust doses in the light of exercise, fi ngerprick glucose,
calorie intake, and carbohydrate counting. •Phone support (trained nurse 7/24).
•Can modify diet wisely and avoid binge drinking (danger of delayed hypoglycae-
mia). •Partner can abort hypoglycaemia: sugary drinks; GlucoGel® PO if coma (no
risk of aspiration). •Dose titration to target—eg by 2–4 UNIT steps.
It is vital to write UNITS in full when prescribing insulin to avoid misinterpre-
tation of U for zero!
Subcutaneous insulins Short-, medium-, or long-acting. Strength: 100U/mL.
1 Ultra-fast acting (Humalog®; Novorapid®); inject at start of meal, or just after
(unless sugar-laden)—helps match what is actually eaten (vs what is planned).
2 Isophane insulin (variable peak at4 –12h): favoured by NICE (it’s cheap!).
3 Pre-mixed insulins (eg NovoMix®3 0 = 30% short-acting and 70% long-acting).
4 Long-acting recombinant human insulin analogues (insulin glargine) are used
at bedtime in type 1 or 2 DM. There is no awkward peak, so good if nocturnal
hypoglycaemia is an issue. Caution if considering pregnancy. Insulin detemir
is similar and has a role in intensive insulin regimens for overweight type 2 DM.
Common insulin regimens Plan the regimen to suit the lifestyle, not vice
versa. Disposable pens: dial dose; insert needle 90° to skin. Vary injection site (outer
thigh/abdomen); change needle daily.
• ‘BD biphasic regimen’: twice daily premixed insulins by pen (eg NovoMix 30®)—
useful in type 2 DM or type 1 with regular lifestyle.
• ‘QDS regimen’: before meals ultra-fast insulin + bedtime long-acting analogue:
useful in type 1 DM for achieving a fl exible lifestyle (eg for adjusting doses with
size of meals, or exercise).
• Once-daily before-bed long-acting insulin: a good initial insulin regimen when
switching from tablets in type 2 DM. Typical dose to work up to (slowly!): ≥1U/24h
for every unit of BMI in adults. Consider retaining metformin (±pio glitazone) if
needed for tight control and patient is unable to use BD regimen.
Dose adjustment for normal eating (DAFNE): Multidisciplinary teams promoting
autonomy can save lives. DAFNE found that training in fl exible, intensive insulin
dosing improved glycaemic control as well as well-being.9 It is resource intensive.
Subcutaneous insulin dosing during intercurrent illnesses (eg infl uenza)
 Advise patients to avoid stopping insulin during acute illness.
• Illness often increases insulin requirements despite reduced food intake.
• Maintain calorie intake, eg using milk.
• Check blood glucose ≥ 4 times a day and look for ketonuria. Increase insulin
doses if glucose rising. Advise to get help from a specialist diabetes nurse or GP
if concerned (esp. if glucose levels are rising or ketonuria). One option is 2-hourly
ultra fast-acting insulin (eg 6–8U) preceded by a fi ngerprick glucose check.
• Admit if vomiting, dehydrated, ketotic (p832), a child, or pregnant.
Insulin pumps (continous subcutaneous insulin) Consider when attempts to
reach HbA1C with multiple daily injections have resulted in disabling hypoglycaemia
or person has been unable to achieve target HbA1C despite careful management.
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) analogues (exenatide, liraglutide)
Work as incretin mimetics. Incretins are gut peptides that work by augm ent ing
insulin release. Given by subcutaneous injection. Patients must have BMI >35 and
specifi c psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity, or have
a BMI lower than 35 kg/m2, and for whom insulin therapy would have signifi cant
occupational implications, or weight loss would benefi t other signifi cant obesity-
related comorbidities. To continue a GLP 1 mimetic, a person should have a bene-
fi cial metabolic response (a reduction of HbA1C by at least 11mmol/mol) and a
weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months.

Complications of established diabetes
Prospective studies show that good control of hyperglycaemia is key to preventi ng
microvascular complications in type 1 and 2 DM.10 Find out what problems are be-
ing experienced (eg glycaemic control, morale, erectile dysfunction—p230).
Assess vascular risk BP control (see BOX ‘Controlling blood pressure in diabetes’) is
crucial for preventing macrov ascular disease and mortality. Refer to smoking ces-
sation services. Check plasma lipids.
Look for complications •Check injection sites for infection or lipohypertrophy
(fatty change): advise on rotating sites of injection if present.
• Vascular disease: Chief cause of death. MI is 4-fold commoner in DM and is more
likely to be ‘silent’. Stroke is twice as common. Women are at high risk—DM re-
moves the vascular advantage conferred by the female sex. Address other risk
factors—diet, smoking, hypertension (p93). Suggest a statin (eg atorvastatin 20mg
nocte) for all, even if no overt IHD, vascular disease, or microa lbuminuria. Aspirin
75mg reduces vascular events (in context of secondary prevention). Safe to use in
diabetic retinopathy.11
• Nephropathy: (p314.) Microalbuminuria is when urine dipstick is Ωve for protein
but the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UA:CR) is 3mg/mmol (units vary, check lab)
refl ecting early renal disease and vascular risk. If UA:CR >3, inhibiting the renin–
angiotensin system with an ACE-i or sartan, even if BP is normal, protects the kidneys.
Spironolactone may also help.12 Refer if UA:CR >7 ± GFR falling by >5mL/min/1.73m2/yr.13
• Diabetic retinopathy: Blindness is preventable. Annual retinal screening man-
datory for all patients. Refer to an ophthalmologist if pre-proliferative changes
or if any uncertainty at or near the macula (the only place capable of 6/6 vision).
Pre-symptomatic screening enables laser photocoagulation to be used, aimed to
stop production of angiogenic factors from the ischaemic retina. Indications: macu-
lopathy or proliferative retinopathy. See fi gs 5.6–5.9.
• Background retinopathy: Microaneurysms (dots), haemorrhages (blots), and
hard exud ates (lipid deposits). Refer if near the macula, eg for intravitreal tri-
amcinolone.
• Pre-proliferative retinopathy: Cotton-wool spots (eg infarcts), haemorrhag-
es, venous beading. These are signs of retinal ischaemia. Refer to a specialist.
• Proliferative retinopathy: New vessels form. Needs urgent referral.
• Maculopathy: (Hard to see in early stages.) Suspect if acuity. Prompt
laser, intra vitreal steroids, or anti-angiogenic agents may be needed in
macular oedema. Pathogenesis: Capillary endothelial change  vascular
leak  microaneurysms  capillary occlusion  local hypoxia + ischae-
mia  new vessel formation. High retinal blood fl ow caused by hypergly-
caemia (and BP and pregnancy) triggers this, causing capillary pericyte
damage. Microvascular occlusion causes cotton-wool spots (± blot haemor-
rhages at interfaces with perfused retina). New vessels form on the disc
or ischaemic areas, proliferate, bleed, fi brose, and can detach the retina.
Aspirin2 (2mg/kg/d) may be recommended by ophthalmologists; there is no
evidence that it  bleeding.
• Cataracts: May be juvenile ‘snowfl ake’ form, or ‘senile’—which occur earlier in
diabetic subjects. Osmotic changes in the lens induced in acute hyperglycaemia
reverse with normoglycaemia (so wait before buying glasses).
• Rubeosis iridis: New vessels on iris: occurs late and may lead to glaucoma.
• Metabolic complications: p832.
• Diabetic feet: p212.
• Neuropathy: p212.
2 As DM has so many vascular events, particularly encourage statin use (p690), esp. if LDL >3mmol/L or systolic
BP >140. Even consider a statin whatever the pre-treatment cholesterol; discuss with your patient.

Controlling blood pressure in diabetes
Type 1 DM: Treat BP if >135/85mmHg, unless albuminuria or two or more features
of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130/80mmHg (NICE 2015). Use an
ACE-i 1st line or angiotension receptor antagonist if intolerant. If hypertensive and
underlying renal involvement, see local guidance, p304.
Type 2 DM: Target BP <140/80mmHg or <130/80mmHg if kidney, eye, or cerebrovas-
cular damage. 1st-line drug treatment should be an ACE-i, except in those of Afri-
can or Caribbean origin, where ACE-i plus diuretic or a calcium-channel antagonist
(CCA) should be started. For pregnant women off er CCA. Do not off er aspirin for the
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease to adults with type 1 DM (NICE 2015).
Don’t combine an ACE-i with an angiotension receptor antagonist.

Improving quality of life: going beyond the pleasures of the fl esh
‘I cannot eat what I want because of your pitiful diet. Sex is out because diabetes
has made me impotent. Smoking is banned, so what’s left? I’d shoot myself if
only I could see straight.’ Start by acknowledging your patient’s distress. Don’t
shrug it off —but don’t take it at face value either. Life may be transformed by
cataract surgery, sildenafi l (unless contraindicated, p230), dietary negotiation, and
sport (it needn’t be shooting). Take steps to simplify care. Stop blood glucose
self-monitoring if it’s achieving nothing (known to  quality of life). Even if all these
interventions fail, you have one trump card up your sleeve: ‘Let’s both try to fi nd
one new thing of value before we next meet—and compare notes’. This opens the
way to vicarious pleasure: a whole new world.

Diabetic neuropathy and diabetic foot care
Refer early to foot services (podiatry, imaging, vascular surgery).
Amputations are common (135/week)—and preventable: good care saves legs.
Examine feet regularly. Distinguish between ischaemia (critical toes ± absent foot
pulses and worse outcome) and peripheral neuropathy (injury or infection over pres-
sure points, eg the metatarsal heads). In practice, many have both.
Neuropathy Sensation in ‘stocking’ distribution: test sensation with a 10g mono-
fi lament fi bre (sensory loss is patchy so examine all areas), absent ankle jerks, neuro-
pathic deformity (Charcot joint, fi g 5.11): pes cavus, claw toes, loss of transverse arch,
rocker-bottom sole. Caused by loss of pain sensation, leading to mech anical stress
and repeated joint injury. Swelling, instability, and deformity. Early recognition is
vital (cellulitis or osteomyelitis are often misdiagnosed).
Ischaemia If the foot pulses cannot be felt, do Doppler pressure measurements.
Any evidence of neuropathy or vascular disease raises risk of foot ulceration.
Educate (daily foot inspection—eg with a mirror for the sole; comfortable shoes).
Regular chiropody to remove callus, as haemorrhage and tissue necrosis may oc-
cur below, leading to ulceration. Treat fungal infections (p408). Surgery (including
endovascular angioplasty balloons, stents, and subintimal recanalization) has a role.
Foot ulceration Typically painless, punched-out ulcer (fi g 5.10) in an area of thick
callus ± superadded infection. Causes cellulitis, abscess ± osteomyelitis.
Assess degree of:
1 Neuropathy (clinically).
2 Ischaemia (clinically + Doppler ± angiography).
3 Bony deformity, eg Charcot joint (clinically + X-ray). See fi g 5.11.
4 Infection (swabs, blood culture, X-ray for osteomyelitis, probe ulcer to reveal depth).
Management: Regular chiropody. Bed rest ± therapeutic shoes. For Charcot joints:
bed rest/crutches/total contact cast until oedema and local warmth reduce and
bony repair is complete (8wks). Bisphosphonates may help. Charcot joints are also
seen in tabes dorsalis, spina bifi da, syringomyelia, and leprosy. Metatarsal head sur-
gery may be needed. If there is cellulitis, admit for IV antibiotics. Common organ-
isms: staphs, streps, anaerobes. Start empirically (as per your local guidance) with
benzylpenicillin 1.2g/6h IV and fl ucloxacillin 1g/6h IV ± metronidazole 500mg/8h IV.
IV insulin may improve healing. Get surgical help early. The degree of peripheral vas-
cular disease, general health, and patient request will determine degree of vascular
reconstruction/surgery.
Absolute indications for surgery: Abscess or deep infection; spreading anaerobic
infection; gangrene/rest pain; suppurative arthritis.
Diabetic neuropathies Symmetric sensory polyneuropathy: (‘glove & stocking’
numbness, tingling, and pain, eg worse at night). : paracetamol  tricyclic (ami-
triptyline 10–25mg nocte; gradually  to 150mg)  duloxetine, gabapentin, or prega-
balin  opiates. Avoiding weight-bearing helps. Mononeuritis multiplex: (eg III & VI
cranial nerves). Treatment: hard! If sudden or seve re, immunosuppression may help
(corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, ciclosporin). Amyotrophy: Painful wasting of
quadriceps and other pelvifemoral muscles. Use electrophysiology to show, eg lum-
bosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy, or proximal crural neuropathy. Natural course:
variable with gradual but often incomplete improvement. IV immunoglobulins have
been used. Autonomic neuropathy: (p505) Postural BP drop; cerebro vascular au-
toregulation; loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (vagal neuropathy); gastroparesis;
urine retention; erectile dysfunction; gustatory sweating; diarrhoea (may respond
to codeine phosphate). Gastroparesis (early satiety, post-prandial bloating, nausea/
vomiting) is diagnosed by gastric scintigraphy with a 99tech netium-labelled meal;
anti-emetics, erythromycin, or gastric pacing. Postural hypotensi on may respond to
fl udrocortisone (SE: oedema, BP)/midodrine (-agonist; SE: BP).

Preventing loss of limbs: primary or secondary prevention?
Traditionally prevention involves foot care advice in diabetic clinics (eg ‘Don’t go
bare-foot’), promoting euglycaemia and normotension. But despite this, the sight
of a diabetic patient minus one limb is not rare, and must prompt us to redouble
our commitment to primary prevention, ie stopping those at risk from ever getting
diabetes. The sequelae of diabetic neuropathy can lead to gangrene, amputation,
and the impact on quality of life can be profound. As one patient post amputation
said, ‘I begin again to walk, on crutches. What nuisance, what fatigue, what sad-
ness, when I think about all my ancient travels, and how active I was just 5 months
ago! Where are the runnings across mountains, the walks, the deserts, the rivers,
and the seas? And now, the life of a legless cripple. For I begin to understand that
crutches, wooden and articulated legs, are a pack of jokes…Goodbye to family,
goodbye to future! My life is gone, I’m no more than an immobile trunk’ (Arthur
Rimbaud. Letter to his sister Isabelle, 10 July 1891).

Special situations in diabetes
Pregnancy: (OHCS p23) 4% are complicated by DM: either pre-existing (<0.5%), or
new-onset gestational diabetes (GDM) (>3.5%).
• All forms carry an increased risk to mother and fetus: miscarriage, pre-term
labour, pre-eclampsia, congenital malformations, macrosomia, and a worsening
of diabetic complications, eg retinopathy, nephropathy.
• Risk of GDM  if: aged over 25; family history; +ve; weight; non-Caucasian; HIV+ve;
previous gestational DM.
• Pre-conception: off er general advice, and discuss risks. Control/reduce weight,
aim for good glucose control, off er folic acid 5mg/d until 12 weeks.
• Screen for GDM with OGTT if risk factors at booking (16–18 weeks if previous GDM).
• Oral hypoglycaemics other than metformin should be discontinued. Metformin
may be used as an adjunct or alternative to insulin in type 2 DM or GDM.
6wks postpartum, do a fasting glucose. Even if Ωve, 50% go on to develop DM.
Surgery: Optimal blood sugar control pre, peri, and post operatively is important
to minimize risk of infection and balance catabolic response to surgery. Type 1
diabetics should ideally be fi rst on the list and BMS should have been stabilized 1–2
days pre major surgery. Consult local policy for how to manage insulin-treated/
non-insulin-treated patients on morning of surgery (eg setting up glucose/insulin
infusion).
Acute illness: Diabetics are prone to hyperglycaemia during periods of illness,
in spite of reduced oral intake. Avoid stopping insulin in periods of acute illness.

Hypoglycaemia
Hypoglycaemia Commonest endocrine emergency—see p834. Prompt diagnosis
and treatment essential—brain damage & death can occur if severe or prolonged.
Defi nition Plasma glucose 3mmol/L. Threshold for symptoms varies. See BOX.
Symptoms Autonomic: Sweating, anxiety, hunger, tremor, palpitations, dizziness.
Neuroglycopenic: Confusion, drowsiness, visual trouble, seizures, coma. Rarely fo-
cal symptoms, eg transient hemiplegia. Mutism, personality change, restlessness,
and incoherence may lead to misdiagnosis of alcohol intoxication or even psychosis.
Fasting hypoglycaemia Causes: The chief cause is insulin or sulfonylurea treatment
in a diabetic, eg activity, missed meal, accidental or non-accidental overdose (check
for ciculating oral hypoglycaemics). In non-diabetics you must EXPLAIN mechanism:
Exogenous drugs, eg insulin, oral hypoglycaemics (p208)? access through diabetic
in the family? Body-builders may misuse insulin to help stamina. Also: alcohol, eg a
binge with no food; aspirin poisoning; ACE-i; -blockers; pentamidine; quinine sulfate;
aminoglutethamide; insulin-like growth factor.14
Pituitary insuffi ciency.
Liver failure, plus some rare inherited enzyme defects.
Addison’s disease.
Islet cell tumours (insulinoma) and immune hypoglycaemia (eg anti-insulin
receptor antibodies in Hodgkin’s disease).
Non-pancreatic neoplasms, eg fi brosarcomas and haema ngiopericytomas.
When to investigate:
• Whipple answered this (Whipple’s triad): symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia +
plasma glucose + resolution of symptoms or signs post glucose rise.
• Document BM during attack and lab glucose if in hospital (monitors often not reli-
able at low readings).
• Take a drug history and exclude liver failure.
• 72h fasting may be needed (monitor closely). Bloods: glucose, insulin, C-peptide,
and plasma ketones if symptomatic. If endogenous hyperinsulinism suspected, do
insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, -hydroxybutyrate.
Interpreting results:
• Hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (HH): Causes: insulinoma, sulfonylureas, insulin
injection (no detectable C-peptide—only released with endogenous insulin); non-
insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome, mutation in the insulin-re-
ceptor gene. Congenital HH follows mutations in genes involved in insulin secretion
(ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, CGK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, ABCC8, & KCNJ11).15
• Insulin low or undetectable, no excess ketones. Causes: non-pancreatic neoplasm;
anti-insulin receptor antibodies.
• Insulin, ketones. Causes: alcohol, pituitary insuffi ciency, Addison’s disease.
Post-prandial hypoglycaemia May occur after gastric/bariatric surgery (‘dump-
ing’, p623), and in type 2 DM. Investigation: Prolonged OGTT (5h, p206).
Treatment See p834. If episodes are often, advise many small high-starch meals.
If post-prandial glucose, give slowly absorbed carbohydrate (high fi bre). In diabet-
ics, rationalize insulin therapy (p209).
The defi nition of hypoglycaemia is context-dependent
The brain stops working if plasma glucose levels get too low, so we are nervous
of levels 3mmol/L. But some are asymptomatic at this level. So what is defi nitely
abnormal? The answer may be 4mmol/L, allowing for inaccuracies in fi ngerprick
BMS (NB: whole blood glucose is 10–15% < plasma glucose.) Think: ‘In this ill patient
when can I be sure that a low glucose is not contr ibuting to their illness?’
If <4mmol/L, you may be wise to treat (p834)—just in case. Consider, is the pa-
tient on hypoglycaemics, have they binged on alcohol 24hrs pre test? Skipped
meals? Is there an underlying illness, eg insulinoma? Unlikely, but possible. Keep
an open mind; let the GP know. Counsel patient and relative about warning signs
of hypoglycaemia. Be more inclined to investigate if the eff ects of even mild hypo-
glycaemia might be disastrous (eg in pilots) or if there are unexplained symptoms.

Insulinoma
This often benign (90–95%) pancreatic islet cell tumour is sporadic or seen with MEN-1
(p223). It presents as fasting hypoglycaemia, with Whipple’s triad:
1 Symp toms associated with fasting or exercise.
2 Recorded hypoglycaemia with symptoms.
3 Symptoms relieved with glucose.
Screening test Hypoglycaemia + plasma insulin during a long fast.
Suppressive tests Give IV insulin and measure C-peptide. Normally exogenous insu-
lin suppresses C-peptide production, but this does not occur in insulinoma.
Imaging CT/MRI ± endoscopic pancreatic US ± IACS (see BOX; all fallible, so don’t waste
too much time before proceeding to intra-operative visualization ± intra-operative ul-
trasound). 18F-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET-CT can help guide laparoscopic surgery.
Treatment Excision.
Nesidioblastosis See BOX. If this doesn’t work, options are: diet, diazoxide, dextrose
IVI, enteral feeding, everolimus.
 Diabetic ketoacidosis Results from insulin defi ciency (eg unknown diagnosis,
intercurrent illness, interuption of insulin therapy). See p832.
Pursuing a voyage to the islets of Langerhans to the bitter end
A 50-year-old had episodic early-morning sweats and tremors and was found
to have hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (= Nesidioblastosis). Selective intra-
arterial calcium infusions (IACS) showed a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion after
infusion of the splenic and superior mesenteric arteries, so setting the stage for
‘hunt the insulinoma’.
But cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic ultrasound were normal. At lapa-
rotomy, no lesion was found despite mobilization of the pancreas, or during intra-
operative ultrasound. ‘Time to sew up and go home?’ ‘No!’ said the surgeon, ‘I’m
going to do a distal pancreatectomy’. Histology showed no discrete insulinoma,
but diff use islet cell hyper plasia (nesidioblastosis). How much pancreas to resect?
Too little and nothing is gained: too much spells pancreatic endocrine disaster.
Luckily the surgeon guessed right, and the patient was cured by the procedure.16

Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
Physiology
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH=thyro tropin), a glycoprotein, is produced from
the anterior pituitary (fi g 5.12). The thyroid produces mainly T4, which is 5-fold less
active than T3. 85% of T3 is formed from peripheral conversion of T4. Most T3 and T4
in plasma is protein bound, eg to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). The unbound por-
tion is the active part. T3 and T4 cell metabolism, via nuclear receptors, and are thus
vital for growth and mental development. They also catecholamine eff ects. Thyroid
hormone abnormalities are usually due to problems in the thyroid gland itself, and
rarely caused by the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary.
TRH from the hypothalamus acts on the pituitary gland
Fig 5.12 Pathways involved in thyroid function.
Basic tests See table 5.2. Free T4 and T3 are more useful than total T4 and T3 as the
latter are aff ected by TBG. Total T4 and T3 are  when TBG is  and vice versa. TBG is 
in pregnancy, oestrogen therapy (HRT, oral contraceptives), and hepatitis. TBG is  in
nephrotic syndrome and malnutrition (both from protein loss), drugs (androgens,
cortico steroids, phenytoin), chronic liver disease, and acromegaly. TSH is very useful:
• Hyperthyroidism suspected: Ask for T3, T4, and TSH. All will have TSH (except the
rare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma). Most have T4, but ~1% have only raised T3.
• Hypothyroidism suspected or monitoring replacement : Ask for only T4 and
TSH. T3 does not add any extra information. TSH varies through the day: trough at
2PM; 30% higher during darkness, so during monitoring, try to do at the same time.
Sick euthyroidism: In any systemic illness, TFTS may become deranged. The typical
pattern is for ‘everything to be low’. The test should be repeated after recovery.
Assay interference is caused by antibodies in the serum, interfering with the test.
Other tests
• Thyroid autoantibodies: Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO; formerly called microsomal)
antibodies or antithyro globulin antibodies may be increased in autoimmune thy-
roid disease: Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. If +ve in Graves’, there is an increased
risk of developing hypothyroidism at a later stage.
• TSH receptor antibody: May be  in Graves’ disease (useful in pregnancy).
• Serum thyroglobulin: Useful in monitoring the treatment of carcinoma (p600), and
in detection of factitious (self-medicated) hyperthyroidism, where it is low.
• Ultrasound: This distinguishes cystic (usually, but not always, benign) from solid
(possibly malignant) nodules. If a solitary (or dominant) large nodule, in a multin od-
ular goitre, do a fi ne-needle aspiration to look for thyroid cancer; see fi g 13.23, p601.
• Isotope scan: (123Iodine, 99technetium pertechnetate, etc; see fi g 13.22, p601.) Useful
for determining the cause of hyperthyroidism and to detect retrosternal goitre, ec-
topic thyroid tissue or thyroid metastases (+ whole body CT). If there are suspicious
nodules, the question is: does the area have increased (hot), decreased (cold), or the
same (neutral) uptake of isotope as the remaining thyroid (see fi g 5.13). Few neu-
tral and almost no hot nodules are malignant. 20% of ‘cold’ nodules are malignant.
Surgery is most likely to be needed if: •rapid growth •compression signs •dominant
nodule on scintigraphy •nodule 3cm •hypo-echogenicity. See also p738.

Thyrotoxicosis
The clinical eff ect of excess thyroid hormone, usually from gland hyperfunction.
Symptoms Diarrhoea; weight; appetite (if , paradoxical weight gain in 10%);
over-active; sweats; heat intolerance; palpitations; tremor; irritability; labile emotions;
oligo menorrhoea ± infertility. Rarely psychosis; chorea; panic; itch; alopecia; urticaria.
Signs Pulse fast/irregular (AF or SVT; VT rare); warm moist skin; fi ne tremor; pal-
mar erythema; thin hair; lid lag; lid retraction (exposure of sclera above iris; caus-
ing ‘stare’, (fi g 5.14; eyelid lags behind eye’s descent as pati ent watches your fi nger
descend slowly). There may be goitre (fi g 5.15); thyroid nodules; or bruit depending
on the cause. Signs of Graves’ disease: 1 Eye disease (BOX ‘Thyroid eye disease’):
exoph th almos, ophthalmoplegia. 2 Pretibial myxoedema: oedematous swellings
above lateral malleoli: the term myxoedema is confusing here. 3 Thyroid acropachy:
extreme manifestation, with clubbing, painful fi nger and toe swelling, and periosteal
reaction in limb bones.
Tests TSH (suppressed), T4, and T3. There may be mild normocytic anaemia, mild neu-
tropenia (in Graves’), ESR, Ca2+, LFT. Also: Check thyroid autoantibodies. Isotope scan
if the cause is unclear, to detect nodular disease or subacute thyroiditis. If ophthal-
mopathy, test visual fi elds, acuity, and eye movem ents (see BOX ‘Thyroid eye disease’).
Causes
Graves’ disease: Prevalence: 0.5% (⅔ of cases of hyperthyroidism). :≈9:1. Typical
age: 40–60yrs (younger if maternal family history). Cause: circulating IgG autoan-
tibodies binding to and activating G-protein-coupled thyrotropin receptors, which
cause smooth thyroid enlargement and hormone production (esp. T3), and react
with orbital autoantigens. Triggers: stress; infection; childbirth. Patients are often
hyperthyroid but may be, or become, hypo- or euthyroid. It is associated with other
autoimmune diseases: vitiligo, type 1 DM, Addison’s (table 5.3).
Toxic multinodular goitre: Seen in the elderly and in iodine-defi cient areas. There
are nodules that secrete thyroid hormones. Surgery is indicated for compressive
symptoms from the enlarged thyroid (dysphagia or dyspnoea).
Toxic adenoma: There is a solitary nodule producing T3 and T4. On isotope scan, the
nodule is ‘hot’ (p216), and the rest of the gland is suppressed.
Ectopic thyroid tissue: Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, or struma ovarii: ovar-
ian teratoma with thyroid tissue.
Exogenous: Iodine excess, eg food contamination, contr ast media (thyroid storm,
p834, if already hyperthyroid). Levothyroxine excess causes T4, T3, thyro globulin.
Others: 1 Subacute de Quervain’s thyroiditis: self-limiting post-viral with painful
goitre, T° ± ESR. Low isotope uptake on scan. : NSAIDS. 2 Drugs: amiodarone (p220),
lithium (hypothyroidism more common). 3 Postpartum. 4 TB (rare).
Treatment
1 Drugs: -blockers (eg propranolol 40mg/6h) for rapid control of symptoms. Anti-
thyroid medication: two strategies (equally eff ective):17 A Titration, eg carbima zole
20–40mg/24h PO for 4wks, reduce according to TFTs every 1–2 months. B Block-
replace: Give carbimazole + levothyroxine simultaneously (less risk of iatrogenic
hypothyroidism). In Graves’, maintain on either regimen for 12–18 months then
withdraw. ~50% will relapse, requiring radioiodine or surgery. Carbimazole SE:
agranulocytosis (n eutrophils, can lead to dangerous sepsis; rare (0.03%)); warn
to stop and get an urgent FBC if signs of infection, eg T°, sore throat/mouth ulcers.
2 Radioiodine ( 131I): Most become hypothyroid post-treatment. There is no evi-
dence for cancer, birth defects, or infertility in women. CI: pregnancy, lactation.
Caution in active hyperthyroidism as risk of thyroid storm (p835).
3 Thyroidectomy (usually total): Carries a risk of damage to recurrent laryngeal
nerve (hoarse voice) and hypoparathyroidism. Patients will become hypothyroid,
so thyroid replacement needed.
4 In pregnancy and infancy: Get expert help. See OHCS p24 & OHCS p182.
Complications Heart failure (thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy,  in elderly), angina, AF
(seen in 10–25%: control hyperthyroidism and war farinize if no contraindication),
osteoporosis, ophthalmopathy, gynaecomastia. Thyroid storm (p835).

Thyroid eye disease
Seen in 25–50% of people with Graves’ disease. The main known risk factor is
smoking. The eye disease may not correlate with thyroid disease and the patient
can be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid at presentation. Eye disease may
be the fi rst presenting sign of Graves’ disease, and can also be worsened by treat-
ment, typically with radioiodine (usually a transient eff ect). Retro-orbital infl am-
mation and lymphocyte infi ltration results in swelling of the orbit.
Symptoms Eye discomfort, grittiness, tear production, photophobia, diplopia,
acuity, aff erent pupillary defect (p72) may mean optic nerve compression: Seek
expert advice at once as decompression may be needed. Nerve damage does not
necessarily go hand-in-hand with protrusion. Indeed, if the eye cannot protrude
for anatomical reasons, optic nerve compression is more likely—a paradox!
Signs Exophthalmos—appearance of protruding eye; proptosis—eyes protrude
beyond the orbit (look from above in the same plane as the forehead); conjunctival
oedema; corneal ulceration; papilloedema; loss of colour vision. Ophth almoplegia
(especially of upward gaze) occurs due to muscle swelling and fi brosis.
Tests Diagnosis is clinical. CT/MRI of the orbits may reveal enlarged eye muscles.
Management Get specialist help. Treat hyper- or hypothyroidism. Advise to stop
smoking (worse prognosis). Most have mild disease that can be treated sympto-
matically (artifi cial tears, sunglasses, avoid dust, elevate bed when sleeping to
periorbital oedema). Diplopia may be managed with a Fresnel prism stuck to one
lens of a spectacle (aids easy changing as the exophthalmos changes). In more se-
vere disease, try high-dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone is better than predniso-
lone 100mg/day PO)18—decreasing according to symptoms. Surgical decomp ression
is used for severe sight-threatening disease, or for cosmetic reasons once the activ-
ity of eye disease has reduced (via an inferior orbital approach, using space in the
ethmoidal, sphenoidal, and maxillary sinuses). Eyelid surgery may improve cosmesis
and function. Orbital radiotherapy can be used to treat ophthalmoplegia but has lit-
tle eff ect on proptosis. Future options: Anti-TNF antibodies (eg infl iximab).

Hypothyroidism (myxoedema)
The clinical eff ect of lack of thyroid hormone. It is common (4/1000/yr). If treated,
prognosis is excellent; untreated it is disastrous (eg heart disease, dementia). As
it is insidious, both you and your patient may not realize anything is wrong, so be
alert to subtle, non-specifi c symptoms, esp. in women 40yrs old (:≈6:1).
Symptoms Tiredness; sleepy, lethargic; mood; cold-disliking; weight; constipa tion;
men orrhagia; hoarse voice; memory/cognition; dementia; myalgia; cramps; weakness.
Signs BRADYCARDIC; refl exes relax slowly; ataxia (cerebellar); dry thin hair/skin;
yawn i ng/drowsy/coma (p834); cold hands ± T°; ascites ± non-pitting oedema (lids;
hands; feet) ± peri cardial or pleural eff usion; round puff y face/double chin/obese; de-
feated demeanour; immobile ± ileus; CCF. Also: neuropathy; myopathy; goitre (fi g 5.16).
Diagnosis (p216) Have a low threshold for doing TFTs! TSH (eg ≥4mU/L);3 T4 (in rare
secondary hypothyroidism: T4 and TSH or  due to lack from the pituitary, p232).
Cholesterol and triglyceride; macrocytosis (less often normochromic anaemia too).
Causes of primary autoimmune hypothyroidism
• Primary atrophic hypothyroidism: :≈6:1. Common. Diff use lymphocytic infi lt-
ration of the thyroid, leading to atrophy, hence no goitre.
• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: Goitre due to lympho cytic and plasma cell infi ltration.
Commoner in women aged 60–70yrs. May be hypothyroid or euthyroid; rarely initial
period of hypert hyroid (‘Hashitoxicosis’). Autoantibody titres are very high.
Other causes of primary hypothyrodism
World-wide the chief cause is iodine defi ciency.
• Post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment.
• Drug-induced: Antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, lithium, iodine.
• Subacute thyroiditis: Temporary hypothyroidism after hyperthyroid phase.
Secondary hypothyroidism Not enough TSH (due to hypopituitarism); very rare.
Hypothyroidism’s associations Autoimmune is seen with other autoimmune dis-
eases (type 1 DM, Addison’s, and PA, p334). Turner’s and Down’s syndromes, cystic
fi brosis, primary biliary cholangitis, ovarian hyperstimulation (OHCS p311); POEMS syn-
drome—poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, m-protein band (plasma-
cytoma) + skin pigmentation/tethering. Genetic: Dyshormonogenesis: genetic (often
autosomal recessive) defect in hormone synthesis, eg Pendred’s syndrome (with deaf-
ness): there is uptake on isotope scan, which is displaced by potassium perchlorate.
Pregnancy problems Eclamps ia, anaemia, prematurity, birthweight, stillbirth, PPH.
Treatment
• Healthy and young: Levothyroxine (T4), 0–100mcg/24h PO; review at 12wks. Ad-
just 6-weekly by clinical state and to normalize but not suppress TSH (keep TSH
>0.5mU/L). Thyroxine’s t½ is ~7d, so wait ~4wks before checking TSH to see if a
dose change is right. NB: small changes in serum free T4 have a logarithmic eff ect
on TSH. Once normal, check TSH yearly. Enzyme inducers (p689) metabolism of
levothyroxine.
• Elderly or ischaemic heart disease: Start with 25mcg/24h; dose by 25mcg/4wks
according to TSH (cautiously, as levothyroxine may precipitate angina or MI).
• If diagnosis is in question and T4 already given: Stop T4; recheck TSH in 6 weeks.
Amiodarone An iodine-rich drug structurally like T4 ; 2% of users will get signifi -
cant thyroid problems from it. Hypothyroidism can be caused by toxicity from io-
dine excess (T4 release is inhibited). Thyrotoxicosis may be caused by a destructive
thyroiditis causing hormone release. Here, radioiodine uptake can be undetectable
and if this is the case, glucocorticoids may help. Get expert help. Thyroidectomy
may be needed if amiodarone cannot be discontinued. T ½ of amiodarone ≈80d, so
problems persist after withdrawal. If on amiodarone, check TFTS 6-monthly.
Myxoedema coma The ultimate hypothyroid state before death. See p834.
3 Treat the patient not the blood level! No exact cut-off in TSH can be given partly because risk of death
from heart disease mirrors TSH even when in the normal range in women. Risk ≈ 1.4 if TSH 1.5–2.4 vs 1.7 if TSH
2.5–3.5. If TSH >3.65 and possibly symptomatic, a low dose of levothyroxine may be tried. Monitor symptoms,
TSH and T4 carefully. Over-exposure to thyroxine may cause osteoporosis ± AF.

Why are symptoms of thyroid disease so various, and so subtle?
Almost all our cell nuclei have receptors showing a high affi nity for T3: that known
as TR-1 is abundant in muscle and fat; TR-2 is abundant in brain; and TR-1 is
abundant in brain, liver, and kidney. These receptors, via their infl uence on various
enzymes, aff ect the following processes:
• The metabolism of substrates, vitamins, and minerals.
• Modulation of all other hormones and their target-tissue responses.
• Stimulation of O2 consumption and generation of metabolic heat.
• Regulation of protein synthesis, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.
• Stimulation of demand for co-enzymes and related vitamins.
Subclinical thyroid disease
Subclinical hypothyroidism Suspect if TSH >4mU/L with normal T4 and T3, and no
symptoms. It is common: ~10% of those >55yrs have TSH. Risk of progression to
frank hypothyroidism is ~2%, and increases as TSH; risk doubles if thyroid peroxi-
dase antibodies are present, and is also increased in men. Management:
• Confi rm that raised TSH is persistent (recheck in 2–4 months).
• Recheck the history: if any non-specifi c features (eg depression), discuss benefi ts
of treating (p220) with the patient—maybe they will function better.
• Have a low threshold for carefully supervised treatment as your patient may
not be so asymptomatic after all, and cardiac deaths may be prevented. Treat
if: 1 TSH ≥10mu/L. 2 +ve thyroid autoantibodies. 3 Past (treated) Graves’. 4 Other
organ-specifi c autoimmunity (type 1 DM, myasthenia, pernicious anaemia, viti-
ligo), as they are more likely to progress to clinical hypothyroidism. If TSH 4–10,
and vague symptoms, treat for 6 months—only continue if symptoms improve
(or the patient is trying to conceive). If the patient does not fall into any of these
categories, monitor TSH yearly.
• Risks from well-monitored treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are small
(but there is an risk of atrial fi brillation and osteoporosis if over-treated).
Subclinical hyperthyroidism occurs when TSH, with normal T4 and T3. There
is a 41% increase in relative mortality from all causes versus euthyroid control
subjects—eg from AF and osteoporosis. Management:
• Confi rm that suppressed TSH is persistent (recheck in 2–4 months).
• Check for a non-thyroidal cause: illness, pregnancy, pituitary or hypothalamic
insuffi ciency (suspect if T4 or T3 are at the lower end of the reference range), use
of TSH-suppressing medication, eg thyroxine, steroids.
• If TSH <0.1, treat on an individual basis, eg with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, AF,
unexplained weight loss, osteoporosis, goitre.
• Options are carbimazole or propylthiouracil—or radioiodine therapy.
• If no symptoms, recheck 6-monthly.

Parathyroid hormone and hyperparathyroidism
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normally secreted in response to low ionized Ca2+ levels,
by four parathyroid glands situated posterior to the thyroid (p601). The glands are
controlled by Ωve feedback via Ca2+ levels. PTH acts by: •osteoclast activity releasing
Ca2+ and PO43Ω from bones •Ca2+ and PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney •active
1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 production is . Overall eff ect is Ca2+ and PO43Ω.
Primary hyperparathyroidism Causes: ~80% solitary adenoma, ~20% hyper plasia of
all glands, <0.5% parathyroid cancer. Presentation: Often ‘asymp tomatic’ (not in retro-
spect!), with Ca2+ on routine tests. Signs relate to: 1 Ca2+ (p676): weak, tired, depressed,
thirsty, dehydrated-but-polyuric; also renal stones, abdominal pain,
panc reatitis, and ulcers (duodenal : gast ric ≈ 7:1). 2 Bone resorption
eff ects of PTH can cause pain, fractures, and osteopenia/osteopo-
rosis. 3 BP: so check Ca2+ in everyone with hypertension. Associa-

inappropriately normal (other causes of this: thiazides, lithium, fa-
milial hypo calciuric hypercalcaemia, tert iary hyperp arathyroidism).
Also PO43Ω (unless in renal failure), ALP from bone activity, 24h uri-
nary Ca2+. Imaging: osteitis fi brosa cystica (due to severe resorp-
tion; rare) may show up as subperiosteal erosions, cysts, or brown

undergone hyperplastic or adenomatous change. This causes Ca2+ from secretion
of PTH unlimited by feedback control. Seen in chronic renal failure.
Malignant hyperparathyroidism Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) is produced
by some squamous cell lung cancers, breast and renal cell carcinomas. This mimics
PTH resulting in Ca2+ (PTH is , as PTHrP is not detected in the assay).
Hypoparathyroidism
Primary hypoparathyroidism PTH secretion is  due to gland failure. Tests: Ca2+,
PO43Ωor , ALP. Signs: Those of hypocalcaemia, p678 ± autoimmune co morbidi ties
(BOX ‘Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes’). Causes: Autoimmune; congenital (Di
George syn., OHCS p642).  : Ca2+ supplements + calcitriol (or synthetic PTH /12h SC: it
prevents hypercalciuria).
Secondary hypoparathyroidism Radiation, surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroid-
ectomy), hypomagnesaemia (magnesium is required for PTH secretion).
Pseudohypoparathyroidism Failure of target cell response to PTH. Signs: Short
metacarpals (esp. 4th and 5th, fi g 5.18), round face, short stature, calcifi ed basal
ganglia (fi g 5.19), IQ. Tests: Ca2+, PTH,  or ALP. : As for 1° hypoparathyroidism.
Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism The morphological features of pseudoh ypo-
parathyroidism, but with normal biochemistry. The cause for both is genetic.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN types 1, 2a, and 2b)
In MEN syndromes there are functioning hormone-producing tumours in multiple
organs (they are inherited as autosomal dominants).20 They comprise: •MEN-1 and 2
•Neurofi bromatosis (p514) •Von Hippel–Lindau and Peutz–Jeghers syndromes
(p712 & p708) •Carney complex (spotty skin pigmentation, schwannomas, myxoma
of skin, mucosa, or heart, especially atrial myxoma), and endo crine tumours: eg
pituit ary adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and testicular tumour.
MEN-1:
• Parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma (~95%; most Ca2+).
• Pancreas endocrine tumours (70%)—gastrin oma (p716) or insulinoma (p215), or,
rarely, somatostatino ma (DM + steatorrhoea + gallstones/cholangitis), VIPoma
(p258), or gluc agonomas (±glucagon syndrome: migrating rash; glossitis; cheili-
tis, fi g 8.5 p327; ana emia; weight; plasma glucagon; glucose).
• Pituitary prolactinoma (~50%) or GH secreting tumour (acromegaly:21 p239); also,
adrenal and carcinoid tumours are associated.
The MEN-1 gene is a tum our suppressor gene. Menin, its protein, alters transc ription
activation. Many are sporadic, presenting in the 3rd–5th decades.
MEN-2a:
• Thyroid: medullary thyroid carcinoma (seen in ~100%, p600).
• Adrenal: phaeochromocytoma (~50%, usually benign and bilateral).
• Parathyroid hyperplasia (~80%, but less than 20% have Ca2+).
MEN-2b: Has similar features to MEN-2a plus mucosal neuromas and Marfanoid
appearance (p706), but no hyper parathyroidism. Mucosal neuromas consist of
‘bumps’ on: lips, cheeks, tongue, glottis, eyelids, and visi ble corneal nerves.
The gene involved in MEN-2a and b is the ret proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine
kinase. Tests for ret mutations are revolu tion izing MEN-2 treatment by enabling a
prophylactic thyroidectomy to be done before neoplasia occurs, usually before
3yrs of age. NB: ret mutations rarely contribute to sporadic parathyroid tumours.
Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes
Autoimmune disorders cluster into two defi ned syndromes:
Type 1 Autosomal recessive, rare.
Cause: Mutations of AIRE (Auto ImmuneREgulator) gene on chromosome 21.
Features: •Addison’s disease. •Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. •Hypo-
parathyroidism. Also associated with hypogonadism, pernicious anaemia, autoim-
mune primary hypothyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, alopecia.
Type 2 HLA D3 and D4 linked, common. Cause: Polygenic.
Features: •Addison’s disease. •Type 1 diabetes mellitus (in 20%).
• Autoimmune thyroid disease—hypothyroidism or Graves’ disease.
Also associated with primary hypogonadism, vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anae-
mia, chronic atrophic gastritis, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis.

Adrenal cortex and Cushing’s syndrome
Physiology The adrenal cortex produces steroids: 1 Glucocorticoids (eg cortisol),
which aff ect carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism. 2 Mineralocorticoids,
which control sodium and potassium balance (eg aldosterone, p668). 3 Androgens,
sex hormones which have weak eff ect until peripheral conversion to testosterone
and dihydrotestosterone. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothala-
mus stimulates ACTH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates cortisol
and androgen production by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is excreted as urinary free
cortisol and various 17-oxogenic steroids.
Cushing’s syndrome This is the clinical state produced by chronic glucocorticoid
excess + loss of the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo–pituitary–
adrenal axis and loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion (normally highest on
waking). The chief cause is oral steroids. Endogenous causes are rare: 80% are due
to ACTH; of these a pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease) is the commonest cause.
1 ACTH-dependent causes (ACTH)
• Cushing’s disease: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from an ACTH-secreting pituitary
adenoma (usually a microadenoma, p234). :>1:1. Peak age: 30–50yrs. A low-
dose dexamethasone test (BOX) leads to no change in plasma cortisol, but 8mg
may be enough to more than halve morning cortisol (as occurs in normals).
• Ectopic ACTH production: Especially small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tum-
ours, p271. Specifi c features: pigmentation (due to ACTH), hypokalaemic
metabolic alkalosis (cortisol leads to mineralocorticoid activity), weight loss,
hyperg lycaemia. Classical features of Cushing’s are often absent. Dexamethasone
even in high doses (8mg) fails to suppress cortisol production.
• Rarely, ectopic CRF production: Some thyroid (medullary) and prostate cancers.
2 ACTH-independent causes (ACTH due to Ωve feedback)
• Iatrogenic: Pharmacological doses of steroids (common).
• Adrenal adenoma/cancer: (May cause abdo pain ± virilization in , p230.) Because
the tumour is autonomous, dexamethasone in any dose won’t suppress cortisol.
• Adrenal nodular hyperplasia: (As for adrenal adenoma, no dexamethasone sup-
pression.)
• Rarely: Carney complex, p223. McCune–Albright syndrome, see OHCS p650.
Symptoms Weight; mood change (depression, lethargy, irritability, psychosis);
proximal weakness; gonadal dysfunction (irregular menses; hirsuti sm; erectile dys-
function); acne; recurrent Achilles tendon rupture; occasionally virilization if .
Signs Central obesity; plethoric, moon face; buff alo hump; supraclavicular fat distri-
bution; skin & muscle atrophy; bruises; purple abdominal striae (fi g 5.20); osteoporo-
sis; BP; glucose; infection-prone; poor healing. Signs of the cause (eg abdo mass).
Tests Random plasma cortisols may mislead, as illness, time of day, and stress (eg
vene puncture) infl uence results. Also, don’t rely on imaging to localize the cause: non-
functioning ‘incidentalomas’ occur in ~5% on adrenal CT and ~10% on pituitary MRI.
MRI detects only ~70% of pituitary tumours causing Cushing’s (many are too small).
Treatment Depends on the cause.
• Iatrogenic: Stop medications if possible.
• Cushing’s disease: Selective removal of pituitary adenoma (trans -sphenoidally).
Bilateral adrenalectomy if source unlocatable, or recurrence post-op (complica-
tion: Nelson’s syndrome: skin pigmentation due to ACTH from an enlarging pituitary
tumour, as adrenalectomy removes Ωve feedback; responds to pituitary radiation).
• Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma: Adrenalectomy: ‘cures’ adenomas but rarely
cures cancer. Radiotherapy & adrenolytic drugs (mitotane) follow if carcinoma.
• Ectopic ACTH: Surgery if tumour is located and hasn’t spread. Metyrapone, ketocon-
azole, and fl uconazole cortisol secretion pre-op or if awaiting eff ects of radia-
tion. Intubat ion + mifepristone (competes with cortisol at receptors) + etomidate
(blo cks cortisol synthesis) may be needed, eg in severe ACTH-associated psychosis.
Prognosis Untreated Cushing’s has vascular mortality.22 Treated, prognosis is good
(but myopathy, obesity, menstrual irregularity, BP, osteoporosis, subtle mood chang-
es and DM often remain—so follow up carefully, and manage individually).

Investigating suspected Cushing’s syndrome
First, confi rm the diagnosis (a raised plasma cortisol), then localize the source on
the basis of laboratory testing. Use imaging studies to confi rm the likely source.
1st-line tests Overnight dexamethasone suppression test is a good outpatient
test. Dexamethasone 1mg PO at midnight; do serum cortisol at 8AM. Normally,
cortisol suppresses to <50nmol/L; no suppression in Cushing’s syndrome. False Ωve
rate: <2%; false +ves: 2% normal, 13% obese, and 23% of inpatients. NB: false +ves
(pseudo- Cushing’s) are seen in depression, obesity, alcohol excess, and inducers of
liver enzymes (rate of dexamethasone metabolism, eg phenytoin, phenobarbital, ri-
fampicin, p689). 24h urinary free cortisol (normal: <280nmol/24h) is an alternative.
2nd-line tests If 1st-line tests abnormal: 48h dexamethasone suppression test:
Give dexamethasone 0.5mg/6h PO for 2d. Measure cortisol at 0 and 48h (last test
at 6h after last dose). Again, in Cushing’s syndrome, there is a failure to suppress
cortisol. 48h high-dose dexamethasone suppression test: (2mg/6h.) May distin-
guish pituitary (suppression) from others causes (no/part suppression). Midnight
cortisol: Admit (unless salivary cortisol used). Often inaccurate due to measure-
ment issues. Normal circadian rhythm (cortisol lowest at midnight, highest early
morning) is lost in Cushing’s syndrome. Midnight blood, via a cannula during sleep,
shows cortisol  in Cushing’s.
Localization tests (Where is the lesion?) If the 1st- and 2nd-line tests are +ve—
Plasma ACTH. If ACTH is undetectable, an adrenal tumour is likely  CT/MRI adrenal
glands. If no mass, proceed to adrenal vein sampling. If ACTH is detectable, dis-
tinguish a pituitary cause from ectopic ACTH production by high-dose suppression
test or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test: 100mcg ovine or human CRH
IV. Measure cortisol at 120min. Cortisol rises with pituitary disease but not with
ectopic ACTH production.
If tests indicate that cortisol responds to manipulation, Cushing’s disease is
likely. Image the pituitary (MRI) and consider bilateral inferior petrosal sinus
blood sampling.
If tests indicate that cortisol does not respond to manipulation, hunt for the
source of ectopic ACTH—eg IV contrast CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis ± MRI of
neck, thorax, and abdomen, eg for small ACTH secreting carcinoid tumours.
Fig 5.20 Hypercortisolism weakens skin;
even normal stretching (or the pressure of
obesity, as here) can make its elastin break—
on healing we see these depressed purple
scars (striae). Cortisone or rapid growth con-
tributes to striae in other contexts: pregnan-
cy, adolescence, weight lifting, sudden-onset
obesity, or from strong steroid creams. Striae
mature into silvery crescents looking like the
underside of willow leaves. Unsightly imma-
ture striae may be improved by YAG lasers.

Addison’s disease (adrenal insuffi ciency)
Primary adrenocortical insuffi ciency (Addison’s disease) is rare (~0.8/100 000),
but can be fatal. Destruction of the adrenal cortex leads to glucocorticoid (cortisol)
and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) defi ciency (see fi g 5.21). Signs are capricious:
it is ‘the unforgiving master of non-specifi city and disguise’.23 You may diagnose
a viral infection or anorexia nervosa in error (K+ is  in the latter but  in Addison’s).
Physiology:
Fig 5.21 Pathways involved in adrenal function.
Causes: 80% are due to autoimmunity in the UK. Other causes: TB (commonest cause
worldwide), adrenal metastases (eg from lung, breast, renal cancer), lymphoma, op-
portunistic infections in HIV (eg CMV, Mycobacterium avium, p400); adrenal haem-
orrhage (Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome p714; antiphosphol ipid syndrome;
SLE), congenital (late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia).
Secondary adrenal insuffi ciency The commonest cause is iatrogenic, due to long-
term steroid therapy leading to suppression of the pituitary–adrenal axis. This only
becomes apparent on withdrawal of the steroids. Other causes are rare and include
hypothalamic–pituitary disease leading to ACTH production. Mineralocorticoid pro-
duction remains intact, and there is no hyperpigmentation as ACTH.
Symptoms Often diagnosed late: lean, tanned, tired, tearful ± weakness, anorexia,
dizzy, faints, fl u-like myalgias/arthralgias. Mood: depression, psychosis. GI: nausea/
vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/constipation. Think of Addison’s in all with un-
explained abdominal pain or vomiting. Pigmented palmar creases & buccal mucosa
(ACTH; cross-reacts with melanin receptors). Postural hypotension. Vitiligo. Signs
of critical deterioration (p836): Shock (BP, tachycardia), T°, coma.
Tests Na+ & K+ (due to mineralocorticoid), glucose (due to cortisol). Also: urae-
mia, Ca2+, eosinophilia, anaemia. : Short ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen® test):
Do plasma cortisol before and ½h after tetracosactide (Synacthen®) 250mcg IM.
Addis on’s is excluded if 30min cortisol >550nmol/L. Steroid drugs may interfere
with assays: ask lab. NB: in pregnancy and contraceptive pill, cortisol levels may
be reass u ring but falsely , due to cortisol-binding globulin. Also: •ACTH: In Addi-
son’s, 9AM ACTH is  (>300ng/L: inappropriately high). It is low in secondary causes
•21-Hydroxylase adrenal autoantibodies: +ve in autoimmune disease in >80%
•Plasma renin & aldosterone: to assess mineralocortocoid status. AXR/CXR: Any
past TB, eg upper zone fi brosis or adrenal calcifi cation? If no autoantibodies, con-
sider further tests (eg adrenal CT) for TB, histoplasma, or metastatic disease.
Treatment See p836 for Addisonian crisis (shocked). Replace steroids: ~15–25mg
hydrocortisone daily, in 2 –3 doses, eg 10mg on waking, 5mg lunchtime. Avoid giving
late (may cause insomnia). Mineralocorticoids to correct postural hypotension, Na+,
K+: fl udrocortisone PO from 50–200mcg daily. Adjust both on clinical grounds. If
there is a poor response, susp ect an associated autoi mmune disease (check thyroid,
do coeliac serology: p266).

Steroid use Advise wearing a bracelet declaring steroid use. Add 5–10mg hydrocor-
tisone to daily intake before strenuous activity/exercise. Double steroids in febrile
illness, injury, or stress. Give out syringes and in-date IM hydrocortis one, and show
how to inject 100mg IM if vomiting prevents oral intake (seek medical help; admit for
IV fl uids if dehydrated).
Follow-up Yearly (BP, U&E); watch for autoimmune diseases (pernicious anaemia).4
Prognosis (treated) Adrenal crises and infections do cause excess deaths: mean age
at death for men is ~65yrs (11yrs <estimated life expectancy; women lose ~3yrs).
 Exogenous steroid use
Replacement steroids are vital in those taking long-term steroids when acutely
unwell. Adrenal insuffi ciency may develop with deadly hypovolaemic shock, if ad-
ditional steroid is not given. See p836.
Steroid use: Warn against abruptly stopping steroids. Emphasize that prescribing
doctors/dentists/surgeons must know of steroid use: give steroid card.
Excerpt from the notes of Miss E.L.R., 92 days before her death from
undiagnosed Addison’s disease. From the Coroner’s Court…
‘Typical day—wakes up at 11.30, still feels tired, then will have some breakfast
and usually fall asleep on the couch. The most energy req. activity in last 1 month
is—cooking herself a pasta meal. Then, totally exhausted will sleep more in pm,
then eat some dinner. Goes to bed at 11pm—latest. Not able to concentrate...Used
to weigh 45kg. Now weighs 42kg.’24
Placed on a page about Addison’s disease, we might think there are suffi cient
clues to raise the suspicion of Addison’s (even though her electrolytes were not
particularly awry, and her pigmentation was barely perceptible). But change the
context to our last busy clinic. We are a little distracted. The memory of Addison’s
is fading. Who among us will hear the alarm bell ring?
4 Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes types 1–4: 1 Monogenic syndrome (AIRE gene on chromosome
21); signs: candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism + Addison’s. 2 (Schmidt syndrome.) Adrenal insuffi ciency + auto
immune thyroid disease ± DM ± pleuritis /pericarditis. 3 Autoimmune thyroid disease + other autoimmune
conditions but not Addison’s. 4 Autoimmune combinations not included in 1–3.

Hyperaldosteronism
Primary hyperaldosteronism Excess production of aldosterone, independent of
the renin–angiotensin system, causing sodium and water retention, and renin re-
lease. Consider if: hypertension, hypokalaemia, or alkalosis in someone not on diuret-
ics. Sodium tends to be mildly raised or normal.
Symptoms: Often asymptomatic or signs of hypokalaemia (p674): weakness (even
quadriparesis), cramps, paraesthesiae, polyuria, polydipsia. BP but not always.
Causes: ~ ⅔ due to a solitary aldosterone-producing adenoma (linked to mutations
in K+ channels)5—Conn’s syndrome. ~ ⅓ due to bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia.
Rare causes: adrenal carcinoma; or glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)—
the ACTH regulatory element of the 11-hydroxylase gene fuses to the aldosterone
synthase gene, aldosterone production, & bringing it under the control of ACTH.
Tests: U&E, renin and aldosterone, and adrenal vein sampling. Do not rely on a low
K+, as >20% are normokalaemic. For GRA (suspect if there is a family history of
early hypertension), genetic testing is available. Treatment: •Conn’s: laparoscopic
adrenalectomy. Spironolactone (25–100mg/24h PO) for 4wks pre-op controls BP and
K+. •Hyperplasia: treated medically: spironolactone or amiloride. •GRA: dexametha-
sone 1mg/24h PO for 4wks, normalizes biochemistry but not always BP. If BP is still ,
use spironolactone as an alternative. •Adrenal carcinoma: surgery ± post-operative
adrenolytic therapy with mitotane—prognosis is poor.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism Due to a high renin from renal perfusion, eg in
renal artery stenosis, accelerated hypertension, diuretics, CCF, or hepatic failure.
Bartter’s syndrome This is a major cause of congenital (autosomal recessive)
salt wasting—via a sodium and chloride leak in the loop of Henle via mutations in
channels and transporters. Presents in childhood with failure to thrive, polyuria, and
polydipsia. BP is normal. Sodium loss leads to volume depletion, causing renin and
aldosterone production, leading to hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, urinary
K+ and ClΩ. Treatment: K+ replacement, NSAIDS (to inhibit prostaglandins), and ACE-i.
Phaeochromocytoma
Rare catecholamine-producing tumours. They arise from sympathetic paragan-
glia cells (=phaeo chrome bodies), which are collections of chromaffi n cells. They
are usually found within the adrenal medulla. Extra-adrenal tumours (para-
gangliomas) are rarer, and often found by the aortic bifurcation (the organs
of Zuckerkandl). Phaeochromocytomas roughly follow the 10% rule: 10% are
malignant, 10% are extra-adrenal, 10% are bilateral, and 10% are familial. Re-
cent data suggest higher preponderance in patients with genetic mutations
aff ecting several genes including SDH (succinyl dehydrogenase). Thus, family his-
tory is crucial and referral for genetic screening (particularly <50 years old). A
dangerous but treatable cause of hypertension (in <0.1%). Associations ~90%
are sporadic; 10% are part of hereditary cancer syndromes (p215), eg thyroid,
MEN-2A and 2B, neurofi bromatosis, von Hippel–Lindau syndrome (SDH mutations).
Classic triad Episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia (± , , or BP, see BOX
‘Features of phaeochromocytoma’).
Tests •Biochemical: 24h urine for metanephrines/metadrenaline (better than cat-
echolamines and vanillylmandelic acid25), WCC. •Localization: Abdominal CT/MRI,
or meta-iodob enzylguanidine (chromaffi n-seeking isotope) scan (can fi nd extra-
adrenal tumours, p738). Treatment Surgery: -blockade pre-op: pheno xybenzamine
(-blocker) is used before -blocker to avoid crisis from unopposed -adrenergic
stimulation, -block too if heart disease or tachycardic. Consult the anaesthe-
tist. Post-op: Do 24h urine metanephrine 2wks post-op, monitor BP (risk of BP).
Emergency  : p837. If malignant, chemotherapy or therapeutic radiolabelled MIBG
may be used. Follow-up: Lifelong: malignant recurrence may present late, genetic
screening.
5 Tumours from the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, or zona reticularis associate with syndromes of 
mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, or androgens respectively, usually; remember ‘GFR≈miner GA’.

Hypertension: a common context for hyperaldosteronism tests
Think of Conn’s in these contexts:
• Hypertension associated with hypokalaemia.
• Refractory hypertension, eg despite ≥3 antihypertensive drugs.
• Hypertension occurring before 40yrs of age (especially in women).
The approach to investigation remains controversial, but the simplest is to look
for a suppressed renin and aldosterone (may be normal if there is severe hy-
pokalaemia). CT or MRI of the adrenals is done to localize the cause. This should
be done after hyperaldosteronism is proven, due to the high number of adrenal
incident alomas. If imaging shows a unilateral adenoma, adrenal vein sampling
may be done (venous blood is sampled from both adrenals). If one side reveals
increased aldosterone:cortisol ratio compared with the other (>3-fold diff erence),
an adenoma is likely, and surgical excision is indicated. If no nodules or bilateral
nodules are seen, think about adrenal hyperplasia or GRA.
NB: renal artery stenosis is a more common cause of refractory BP and K+ (p315).
Features of phaeochromocytoma (often episodic and often vague)
Try to diagnose before death: suspect if BP hard to control, accelerating, or episodic.
• Heart: Pulse; palpit ations/VT; dyspnoea; faints; angina; MI/LVF; cardiomyopathy.6
• CNS: Headache; visual disorder; dizziness; tremor; numbness; fi ts; encephalopa-
thy; Horner’s syndrome (paraganglioma); subarachnoid/CNS haemorrhage.
• Psychological: Anxiety; panic; hyperactivity; confusion; episodic psychosis.
• Gut: D&V; abdominal pain over tumour site; mass; mesenteric vasoconstriction.
• Others: Sweats/fl ushes; heat intolerance; pallor; T°; backache; haemoptysis.
Symptoms may be precipitated by straining, exercise, stress, abdominal pressure,
surgery, or by agents such as -blockers, IV contrast agents, or the tricyclics. The
site of the tumour may determine precipitants, eg if pelvic, precipitants include
sexual intercourse, parturition, defecation, and micturition. Adrenergic crises may
last minutes to days. Suddenly patients feel ‘as if about to die’—and then get
better, or go on to develop a stroke or cardiogenic shock. On examination, there
may be no signs, or hypertension ± signs of heart failure/cardiomyopathy (± para-
doxical shock, similar to Takotsubo’s6), episodic thyroid swelling, glycosuria during
attacks, or terminal haematuria from a bladder phaeochromocytoma.
6 Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (=stress- or catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy/broken heart syn-
drome) may cause sudden chest pain mimicking MI, with ST segments, and its signature apical ballooning
on echo (also ejection fraction) occurring during catecholamine surges. It is a cause of MI in the presence
of normal arteries. The stress may be medical (SAH, p478) or psychological.

Hirsutism, virilism, gynaecomastia, and impotence
Hirsutism is common (10% of women) and usually benign. It implies male pattern
hair growth in women. Causes are familial, idiopathic, or are due to androgen secre-
tion by the ovary (eg polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian cancer, OHCS p281), the
adrenal gland (eg late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, OHCS p251, Cushing’s
syndrome, adrenal cancer), or drugs (eg steroids). Polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS) causes secondary oligo- or amenorrhoea, infertility, obesity, acne, and hirsutism
(OHCS p252). Ultrasound: bilateral polycystic ovaries. Blood tests: testosterone
(if ≥6nmol/L, look for an androgen-producing adrenal or ovarian tumour), sex-
hormone binding globulin, LH : FSH ratio (not consistent), TSH, lipids. Address any feel-
ings of lack of conformity to society’s perceived norms of feminine beauty.
Management: Healthy eating, optimize weight, shaving; laser photoepilation; wax;
creams, eg efl ornithine, or ele c trolysis (expensive/time-consuming, but eff ective);
bleach (1 : 10 hydrogen peroxide).
• Oestrogens: combined contraceptive pill (OHCS p302)—Yasmin® is one choice as its
progestogen, drospirenone, is an antimineralocorticoid. Alternatively, co-cyprindiol
provided there are no contraindications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and
current breast cancer. Stop co-cyprindiol 3–4 months after hirsutism has complete-
ly resolved because of increased VTE risk. If COCS are contraindicated or have not
worked (after 6/12), refer the woman to secondary care for specialist treatment:
• Metformin (helps with insulin resistance) and spironolactone are sometimes tried.
• Clomifene is used for infertility (a fertility expert should prescribe).
Virilism Onset of amenorrhoea, clitoromegaly, deep voice, temporal hair recession +
hirsutism. Look for an androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumour.
Gynaecomastia (ie abnormal amount of breast tissue in men; may occur in normal
puberty.) Oestrog en/androgen ratio (vs galactorrhoea in which prolactin is ).
Causes: Hypogonadism (see BOX ‘Male hypogonadism’), liver cirrhosis (oestrogens),
hyperthyroidism, tumours (oestrogen-producing, eg testicular, adrenal; HCG-producing,
eg testicular, bronchial); drugs: oestrogens, spirono lactone, digoxin, testosterone,
marijuana; if stopping is impossible, consider testosterone if hypogonadism ± anti-
oestrogen (tamoxifen).
Impotence (= erectile dysfunction) Erections result from neuronal release of nitric
oxide (NO) which, via cGMP and Ca2+, hyperpolarizes and thus relaxes vascular and
trabecular smooth muscle cells, allowing engorgement. Common after 50yrs, and of-
ten multifactorial. A psychological facet is common (esp. if erectile dysfunction occurs
only in some situations, if onset coincides with stress, and if early morning erections
still occur: these also persist in early organic disease).
Organic causes: The big three: smoking, alcohol, and diabetes (reduce NO +autonomic

Contraindications and cautions to PD5 inhibitors
Contraindications
• Concurrent use of nitrates.
• BP high or systolic <90mmHg/arrhythmia.
• Degenerative retinal disorders, eg retinitis pigmentosa.
• Unstable angina/stroke <6 months ago.
• Myocardial infarction <90 days ago.
Cautions Angina (especially if during intercourse).
• Bleeding; peptic ulcer (sildenafi l).
• Marked hepatic or renal impairment.
• Peyronie’s disease or cavernosal fi brosis.
• Risk of priapism (sickle-cell anaemia, myeloma, leukaemia).
• Concurrent complex antihypertensive regimens.
• Dyspnoea on minimal eff ort (sexual activity may be unsupportable).
Use in coronary artery disease has been a question, but is probably OK.26
Interactions: Nitrates (contraindication); cytochrome p450 (CYP3A) inducers:
macrolides, protease inhibitors, theophyllines, azole antifungals, rifamp icin, phe-
nytoin, carbamazepine, phenob arbital, grapefruit juice (bioavailability). Caution if
-blocker use; avoid vardenafi l with type 1A (eg quinidine; procainamide) and type 3
anti-arrhythmics (sotalol; amiodarone)—as well as nitrates as above-mentioned.
Male hypogonadism
Hypogonadism is failure of testes to produce testosterone, sperm, or both. Fea-
tures: small testes, libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of pubic hair, muscle bulk,
fat, gynaecomastia, osteoporosis, mood. If prepubertal: virilization; incomplete
puberty; eunuchoid body; reduced secondary sex characteristics. Causes include:
Primary hypogonadism is due to testicular failure, eg from •local trauma, tor-
sion, chemotherapy/irradiation •post-orchitis, eg mumps, HIV, brucellosis, leprosy
•renal failure, liver cirrhosis, or alcohol excess (toxic to Leydig cells) •chromosom-
al abnormalities, eg Klinefelter’s syndrome (47XXY)—delayed sexual development,
small testes, and gynaecomastia. Anorchia is rare.
Secondary hypogonadism Gonadotropins (LH & FSH), eg from •hypo pituitarism
•prolactinoma •Kallman’s syndrome—isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone
defi ciency, often with anosmia and colour blindness •systemic illness (eg COPD; HIV;
DM) •Laurence–Moon–Biedl and Prader–Willi syndromes (OHCS p648 & p652) •Age.
: (p232) If total testosterone 8nmol/L, on 2 mornings (or <15 if LH too) and muscle
bulk, testosterone may help, eg 1% dermal gel (Testogel®). Heart, bladder, and sex-
ual fun ction may perk up in age-related hypogonadism. Beware medicalizing ageing!
CI Ca2+; nephrosis; polycythaemia; prostate, breast or liver ca. Monitor PSA.

Hypopituitarism
Hypopituitarism entails secretion of anterior pituitary hormones (fi gs 5.3, 5.22). They
are aff ected in this order: growth hormone (GH), gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and
adreno corticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL). Panhypop ituitarism is defi cien-
cy of all anterior hormones, usually caused by irradiation, surgery, or pituitary tumour.
Causes are at three levels. 1 Hypothalamus: Kallman’s syndrome (p231), tumour,
infl amm ation, infection (meningitis, TB), ischaemia. 2 Pituitary stalk: Trauma, sur-
gery, mass lesion (craniopharyngioma, p234), meningioma, carotid artery aneurysm.
3 Pituitary: Tumour, irradiation, infl ammation, autoimmunity,7 infi ltration (haemo-
chromatosis, amyl oid, metastases), ischaemia (pituitary apoplexy, p234; DIC 8; Shee-
han’s syndrome9).
Features are due to:
1 Hormone lack: •GH: central obesity, atherosclerosis, dry wrinkly skin, strength,
bala nce, well-being, exercise ability, cardiac output, osteoporosis, glucose.
•Gonadotropin (FSH; LH):  oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, fertility, libido, os-
teoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia.  Erectile dysfunction, libido, muscle bulk,
hypogonadism (hair, all over; small testes; ejaculate volume; spermatogenesis).
•Thyroid: as for hypothyroidism (p220). •Corticotropin: as for adrenal insuffi ciency
(p226). NB: no skin pigmentation as ACTH. •Prolactin: rare: absent lactation.
2 Causes: Eg pituitary tumour (p234), causing mass eff ect, or hormone secretion
with secretion of other hormones—eg prolactinoma, acromegaly, rarely Cushing’s.
Tests (The triple stimulation test is now rarely done.)
• Basal tests: LH and FSH ( or ), testosterone or oestradiol (); TSH ( or ), T4 ();
prolactin (may be , from loss of hypothalamic dopamine that normally inhibits its
release), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; —used as a measure of GH axis, p238),
cortisol (). Also do U&E (Na+from dilution), Hb (normochromic, normocytic).
• Dynamic tests: 1 Short Synacthen® test: (p226) to assess the adrenal axis.
2 Insulin tolerance test (ITT): done in specialist centres to assess the adrenal and GH
axes. CI: epilepsy, heart disease, adrenal failure. Consult lab fi rst. It involves IV insu-
lin to induce hypoglycaemia, causing stress to cortisol and GH secretion. It is done
in the morning (water only taken from 22:00h the night before). Have 50% glucose
and hydrocortisone to hand and IV access. Glucose must fall below 2.2mmol/L and
the patient should bec ome symptomatic when cortisol and GH are taken. Normal:
GH >20mU/L, and peak cortisol >550nmol/L.
3 Arginine + growth hormone-releasing hormone test.
4 Glucagon stimulation test is alternative when ITT is contraindicated.
• Investigate cause: MRI scan to look for a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion.
Treatment Refer to an endocrinologist for assessment of pituitary fuction and to
oversee hormone replacement and treatment of underlying cause.
• Hydrocortisone for 2° adrenal failure (p226) before other hormones are given.
• Thyroxine if hypothyroid (p220, but TSH is useless for monitoring).
• Hypogonadism (for symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis). : options include
testosterone enan thate 250mg IM every 3 weeks, daily topical gels or buccal
muco adhesive tablets. Patches (eg Testogel®) are also used. : (premenopausal).
Oestrogen: transdermal oestradiol patches, or contrac eptive pill (exceeds replace-
ment needs) ± testosterone or dehydroepi androsterone (DHEA, in hypo androgenic
women; a small amount may improve well-being and sexual function, and help
bone mineral density and lean body mass).
• Gonadotropin therapy is needed to induce fertility in both men and women.
• Growth hormone (GH). Somatotrophin mimics human GH. It addresses problems
of fat mass, bone mass, lean body mass (muscle bulk), exercise capacity, and
problems with heat intolerance.
7 Autoimmune hypophysitis (=infl amed pituitary) mimics pituitary adenoma. It may be triggered by preg-
nancy or immunotherapy blocking CTLA-4. No pituitary auto-antigen is yet used diagnostically.
8 Snake bite is a common cause in India (eg when associated with acute kidney injury).
9 Sheehan’s syndrome is pituitary necrosis after postpartum haemorrhage.

Creation of Adam) ‘all gods and demons that have ever existed are within us as possibilities, de-
sires, and ways of escape’. Within the dark red vault of our skull we see human and god-like forms
reaching out, as thoughts escape into actions—with legs extending into our brainstem (B) and a
fi st is pushing from our hypothalamus into the pituitary stalk (P). Above the pituitary we have
thoughts, ideas, impulses, and neurotransmitters. Below we have hormones. Between is the realm
of neuroendocrinology—the neurosecretory cells which turn emotions into the releasing factors
for the pituitary hormones (fi g 5.4).

Pituitary tumours
Pituitary tumours (almost always benign adenomas) account for 10% of intracranial
tumours (see fi gs 5.23, 5.24). They may be divided by size: a microadenoma is a tumour
<1cm across, and a macroadenoma is >1cm. There are three histological types (table 5.4):
1 Chromophobe 70%. Many are non-secretory,10 some cause hypopituitarism. Half
produce prolactin (PRL); a few produce ACTH or GH. Local pressure eff ect in 30%.
2 Acidophil 15%. Secrete GH or PRL. Local pressure eff ect in 10%.
3 Basophil 15%. Secrete ACTH. Local pressure eff ect rare.
Symptoms are caused by pressure, hormones (eg galactorrhoea), or hypopituitarism
(p232). FSH-secreting tumours can cause macro-orchidism in men, but are rare.
Features of local pressure Headache, visual fi eld defects (bilateral temporal hemi-
anopia, due to compression of the optic chiasm), palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, VI
(pressure or invasion of the cavernous sinus; fi g 5.25). Also, diabetes insipidus (DI)
(p240; more likely from hypothalamic disease); disturbance of hypothalamic centres
of T°, sleep, and appetite; erosion through fl oor of sella leading to CSF rhinorrhoea.
Tests MRI defi nes intra- and supra-sellar extension; accurate assessment of visual
fi elds; screening tests: PRL, IGF-1 (p238), ACTH, cortisol, TFTS, LH/FSH, testosterone in
, short Synacthen® test. Glucose tolerance test if acromegaly suspected (p238).
If Cushing’s suspected, see p225. Water deprivation test if DI is suspected (p240).
Treatment Start hormone replacement as needed (p232). Ensure steroids are given
before levothyroxine, as thyroxine may precipitate an adrenal crisis. For Cushing’s
disease see p225, prolactinoma p236, acromegaly p238.
• Surgery: (fi g 5.26) Most pituitary surgery is trans-sphenoidal, but if there is supra-
sellar extension, a trans-frontal approach may be used. For prolactinoma, 1st-line
treatment is medical with a dopamine agonist, p236. Pre-op: ensure hydrocortisone
100mg IV/IM. Subsequent cortisol replacement and reasse ssment varies with local
protocols: get advice. Post-op: retest pituitary function (p232) to assess replace-
ment needs. Repeating dynamic tests for adrenal function ≥6 weeks post-op.
• Radiotherapy: (Eg stereotactic.) Good for residual or recurrent adenomas (good
rates of tumour control and normalization of excess hormone secretion).27
Post-op Recurrence may occur late after surgery, so life-long follow-up is required.
Fertility should be discussed: this may be reduced post-op due to gonadotropins.
Pituitary apoplexy Rapid pituitary enlargement from a bleed into a tumour may
cause mass eff ects, cardiovascular collapse due to acute hypopituita rism, and death.
Suspect if acute onset of headache, meningism, GCS, ophthalmop legia/visual fi eld
defect, especially if there is a known tumour (may present like suba rachnoid haem-
orrhage). : Urgent steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg IV) and meticulous fl uid balance
± cabergoline (dopamine agonist, if prolactinoma) ± surgery; fi nd the cause, eg a
predisposition to thrombosis, from antiphospholipid syndrome.
Craniopharyngioma Not strictly a pituitary tumour: it originates from Rathk e’s
pouch so is situated between the pituitary and 3rd ventricle fl oor. They are rare, but
are the commonest childhood intracranial tumour. Over 50% present in childhood
with growth failure; adults may present with amenorrhoea, libido, hypothalamic
symptoms (eg DI, hyperphagia, sleep disturbance) or tumour mass eff ect. Tests: CT/
MRI (calcifi cation in 50%, may also be seen on skull x-ray). Treatment: Surgery ±
post-op radiation; test pituitary function post-op.
Table 5.4 Frequency of hormones secreted by pituitary adenomas based on immunohistochemistry
Hormone % Hormone %
PRL only (prolactinoma) 35% ACTH (Cushing’s disease) 7%
GH only (acromegaly) 20% LH/FSH/TSH ≥1%*
PRL and GH 7% No obvious hormone 30%
*Sensitive methods of TSH measurement have improved recognition of TSH-secreting tumours. These are
now more frequently found at microadenoma stage, medially loca ted, and without associated hormone
hypersecretion. In these tumours, somatostatin analogues (p238) are very helpful. See also Socin et al. Eur
J Endocrinol. 2003;148:433–42.
10 If <1cm, usually ‘incidentaloma’; most non-functioning macroadenomas are revealed by mass eff ect and/
or hypopituitarism. Here, recurrence after surgery is common, so follow carefully with MRIS.

Hyperprolactinaemia
This is the commonest hormonal disturbance of the pituitary. It presents earlier
in women (menstrual disturbance) but later in men (eg with erectile dysfunction
and/or mass eff ects). Prolactin stimulates lactation.11,12 Raised levels lead to hypo-
gonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropin-re-
leasing hormone (hence LH/FSH and testosterone or oestrogen).
Causes of raised plasma prolactin (PRL; >390mU/L) PRL is secreted from the an-
terior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothala mus.
Hyperprolactinaemia may result from 1 Excess production from the pituitary, eg
prolactinoma. 2 Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk, reducing local
dopamine levels. 3 Use of a dopamine antagonist. A PRL of 1000–5000mU/L may re-
sult from any, but >5000 is likely to be due to a prolactinoma, with macroadenomas
(>10mm) having the highest levels, eg 10 000–100 000.
• Physiological: Pregnancy; breastfeeding; stress. Acute rises occur post-orgasm.11
• Drugs (most common cause): Metoclop ramide; haloperidol; methyldopa; oes-
trogens; ecstasy/MDMA;12 antipsychotics (a reason for ‘non-compliance’: sustained
hyperprolactinaemia may cause libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction).
• Diseases: Prolactinoma: micro- or macroadenoma; Stalk damage: pituitary ad-
enomas, surgery, trauma; Hypot halamic disease: craniopharyngioma, other tu-
mours; Other: hypothyroidism (due to TRH), chronic renal failure (excretion).
Symptoms : Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea; infertility; galactorrhoea (fi g 5.27).
Also: libido, weight, dry vagina. : Erectile dysfunction, facial hair, galactorrhoea.
May present late with osteoporosis or local pressure eff ects from the tumour (p234).
Tests Basal PRL: non-stressful venepuncture between 09.00 and 16.00h. Do a preg-
nancy test, TFT, U&E. MRI pituitary if other causes are ruled out.
Management Refer to a specialist endocrinology clinic. Dopamine agonists (bro-
mocriptine or cabergoline) are 1st line.
Microprolactinomas: A tumour <10mm on MRI (~25% of us have asymptomatic
microprolactinomas). Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, PRL secretion, restores
menstrual cycles and tumour size. Dose is titrated up: 1.25mg PO; increase weekly
by 1.25–2.5mg/d until ~2.5mg/12h. SE: nausea, depression, postural hypotension (mini-
mize by giving at night). If pregnancy is planned, use barrier contraception until 2
periods have occurred. If subsequent pregnancy occurs, stop bromocriptine after
the 1st missed period. An alternative dopamine agonist is cabergoline: more eff ec-
tive and fewer SE, but there are fewer data on safety in pregnancy. NB: ergot alkaloids
(bromocriptine and cabergoline) can cause fi brosis (eg echocardiograms are need-
ed). Trans-sphenoidal surgery may be considered if intolerant of dopamine agonists.
It has a high success rate, but there are risks of permanent hormone defi ciency and
prolactinoma recurrence, and so it is usually reserved as a 2nd-line treatment.
Macroprolactinomas: A tumour >10mm diameter on MRI. As they are near the optic
chiasm, there may be acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, visual-fi eld loss, and op-
tic atrophy. Treat initially with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine if fertility is the
goal). Surgery is rarely needed , but consider if visual symptoms or pressure eff ects
which fail to respond to medical treatment. Bromocriptine, and in some cases radia-
tion therapy, may be required post-op as complete surgical resection is uncommon.
If pregnant, monitor closely ideally in a combined endocrine/antenatal clinic as there
is risk of expansion.
Follow-up Monitor PRL. If headache or visual loss, check fi elds (? do MRI). Medication
can be decreased after 2yrs, but recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia and expansion
of the tumour may occur, and so these patients should be monitored carefully.
11 The prolactin increase ( and ) after coitus is ~400% greater than after masturbation; post-orgasmic
prolactin is part of a feedback loop decreasing arousal by inhibiting central dopaminergic processes. The
size of post-orgasmic prolactin increase is a neurohormonal index of sexual satisfaction.
12 MDMA also oxytocin; prolactin + oxytocin are thought to mediate post-orgasmic well-being.

Fig 5.27 Galactorrhoea can be prolifi c enough to create medium-sized galaxies (bott om right).
In the Birth of the Milky Way Hera is depicted by Rubens in her chariot, being drawn through
the night sky by ominous black peacocks. Between journeys, she enjoyed discussing diffi cult en-
docrinological topics with her husband Zeus (who was also her brother), such as whether women
or men fi nd sexual intercourse more enjoyable. Hera inclined to the latter—and it is on this fl imsy
evidence, and her gorgeous galactorrhoea, that we diagnose her hyperprolactin aemia (which is
known to decrease desire, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction). In the end, this issue was settled,
in favour of Zeus’s view, by Tiresias, who had unique insight into this intriguing question: every time
this soothsayer saw two snakes entwined, (s)he changed sex, so coming to know a thing or two
about gender and pleasure. This is a primordial example of an ‘N of 1’ trial, where the subject is his
or her own control. Generalizability can be a problem with this methodology.

Acromegaly
This is due to secretion of GH (growth hormone) from a pituitary
tumour (99%) or hyperplasia, eg via ectopic GH-releasing hormone
from a carcinoid tumour. :≈1:1. Incidence: UK 3/million/yr. ~5%
are associated with MEN-1 (p223). GH stimulates bone and soft tissue
growth through secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1).
Symptoms Acroparaesthesia (akron=extremities); amenor-
rhoea; libido; headache; sweating; snoring; arthralgia; backache;
fi g 5.28: ‘My rings don’t fi t, nor my old shoes, and now I’ve got a
wonky bite (malocclusion) and curly hair. I put on lots of weight,
all muscle and looked good for a while; now I look so haggard’.
Signs (BOX ‘Signs of acromegaly’.) Often predate diagnosis by
>4yrs. If acromegaly occurs before bony epiphyses fuse (rare),
gigantism occurs.
Complications (May present with CCF or ketoacidosis.)
• Impaired glucose tolerance (~40%), DM (~15%).
• Vascular: BP, left ventricular hypertrophy (±dilatation/CCF),
cardiomyopathy, arrhy thmias. There is risk of ischaemic heart
disease and stroke (?due to BP ± insulin resistance and GH-in-
duced increase in fi brinogen and decrease in protein S).
• Neoplasia: colon cancer risk; colonoscopy may be needed.21
Acromegaly in pregnancy (Subfertility is common.) Pregnancy
may be normal; signs and chemistry may remit. Monitor glucose.
Tests Glucose, Ca2+, and PO43Ω. GH: Don’t rely on random GH as
secreti on is pulsatile and during peaks acromega lic and normal
levels overlap. GH also  in: stress, sleep, puberty, and pregnancy.
Normally GH secretion is inhibited by high glucose, and GH hardly
detectable. In acromegaly GH release fails to suppress.
• If basal serum GH is >0.4mcg/L (1.2mIU/L) and/or if IGF-I (p232),
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed. If the lowest GH
value during OGTT is above 1mcg/L (3mIU/L), acrom egaly is con-
fi rmed. With general use of very sensitive assays, it has been
said that this cut-off be decreased to 0.3mcg/L (0.9mIU/L).28
Method: Collect samples for GH glucose at: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120,
150min. Possible false +ves: puberty, pregnancy, hepatic and
renal disease, anorexia nervosa, and DM.
• MRI scan of pituitary fossa. • Look for hypopituitarism (p232).
• Visual fi elds and acuity. • ECG, echo. Old photos if possible.
Treatment Aim to correct (or prevent) tumour compression by
excising the lesion, and to reduce GH and IGF-I levels to at least a
‘safe’ GH level of <2mcg/L (<6mIU/L). A 3-part strategy: 1 Trans-
sphenoidal surgery is often 1st line. 2 If surgery fails to correct
GH/IGF-I hypersecretion, try somatostatin analogues (SSA) and/or
radiotherapy, SSA being generally preferred. Example: octreotide
(Sandostatin LAR®, given monthly IM), or lanreotide (Somatuline
LA®). SE: pain at the injection site; gastrointestinal: abdominal
cramps, fl atulence, loose stools, gallstones; impaired glucose
tolerance. 3 The GH antagonist pegvisomant (recombinant GH ana-
logue) is used if resistant or intolerant to SSA. It suppr esses IGF-1
to normal in 90%, but GH levels may rise; rarely tumour size in-
creases, so monitor closely. Radiotherapy: If unsuited to surg ery
or as adjuvant; may take years to work. Follow-up: Yearly GH, IGF-
1 ± OGTT; visual fi elds; vascular assess ment. BMI; photos (fi g 5.29).
Prognosis May return to normal (any excess mortality is mostly
vascular). 16% get diabetes with SSAs vs ~13% after surgery.

Dysmorphia, personal identity, and acromegaly
We might have devoted this box to a grotesque homunculus depicting the signs of
acromegaly: all disconnected lips, hands, feet, brows, and noses. But our integra-
tive ethics disallow this, and ask us instead to see if acromegaly can reveal some-
thing universal about our patients and ourselves. What is it like to feel in the grip
of some ‘alien puberty’ or ‘empty pregnancy’? These analogies are physiological as
well as metaphorical.14,15 The changes of acromegaly are not so insidious that the
patient thinks all is fi ne: there is often partial knowledge and a few dark thoughts
on looking into the mirror. Even when we lay our lives end-to-end for inspection
(fi g 5.28), changes are subtle. It can take the observations of others to force us
to come face-to-face with the truth of our new unfolding self. In one patient the
comment was ‘So are you pregnant again?’ ‘Why do you ask?’ ‘Because your nose
is as big as it was when you were last pregnant’. So here we have the well-known
‘physiological acromegaly of pregnancy’14 predating the pathological, as the carni-
val of personal identity moves from helter-skelter to roller-coaster.
14 GH variants made by the placenta rise exponentially until 37wks’ gestation; pituitary GH gradually drops
to near-undetectable levels. ‘Gestational acromegaly’ probably develops to foster fetoplacental growth; its
side-eff ects include facial oedema, carpal tunnel symptoms, and nose enlargement.
15 Puberty sees GH- and gonad-mediated rises in bone and muscle mass + other ‘acromegalic’ eff ects.

Diabetes insipidus (DI)
Physiology This is the passage of large volumes (>3L/day) of dilute urine due to
impaired water resorption by the kidney, because of reduced ADH secretion from the
posterior pituitary (cranial DI) or impaired response of the kidney to ADH (nephro-
genic DI).
Symptoms Polyuria; polydipsia; dehydration; symptoms of hypernatraemia (p672).
Polydipsia can be uncontrollable and all-consuming, with patients drinking anything
and everything to hand: in such cases, if beer is on tap, disaster will ensue!
Causes of cranial DI •Idiopathic (50%). •Congenital: defects in ADH gene, DIDMOAD.16
•Tumour (may present with DI + hypopituitarism): craniopharyn gioma, metastases,
pituitary tumour. •Trauma: temporary if distal to pituitary stalk as proximal nerve
endings grow out to fi nd capillaries in scar tissue and begin direct secretion again.
•Hypophysectomy. •Autoimmune hypophysitis (p232). •Infi ltration: histiocytosis,
sarcoid o sis.17 •Vascular: haemorrhage.18 •Infection: meningoencephalitis.
Causes of nephrogenic DI •Inherited. •Metabolic: low potassium, high calcium.
•Drugs: lithium, demeclocycline. •Chronic renal disease. •Post-obstructive uropathy.
Tests U&E, Ca2+, glucose (exclude DM), serum and urine osmolalities. Serum osmo l ality
estimate ≈ 2 ≈ (Na+ + K+) + urea + glucose (all in mmol/L). Normal plasma osmolality is
285–295mOsmol/kg, and urine can be concentrated to more than twice this concentra-
tion. Signifi cant DI is excluded if urine to plasma (U:P) osmolality ratio is more than 2:1,
provided plasma osmolality is no greater than 295mOsmol/kg. In DI, despite raised
plasma osmolality, urine is dilute with a U:P ratio <2. In primary polydipsia there may be
dilutional hyponatraemia—and as hyponatraemia may itself cause mania, be cautious
of saying ‘It’s water intoxication from psychogenic polydipsia’.
Diagnosis Water deprivation test: See BOX ‘The 8-hour water deprivation test’. NB:
it is often diffi cult to diff erentiate primary polydipsia from partial DI. : DM; diuret-
ics or lithium use; primary polydipsia causes symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria
with dilute urine. Its cause is poorly understood;19 it may be associated with schizo-
phrenia or mania (±Li+ therapy), or, rarely, hypothal amic dis ease (neurosarcoid; tu-
mour; encephalitis; brain injury; HIV encephalopathy). As part of this syndrome, the
kidneys may lose their ability to fully concentrate urine, due to a wash-out of the
normal concentrating gradient in the renal medulla.
Treatment Cranial DI: MRI (head); test anterior pituitary function (p232). Give desm-
opressin, a synthetic analogue of ADH (eg Desmomelt® tablets).
Nephrogenic: Treat the cause. If it persists, try bendro fl umethiazide 5mg PO/24h.
NSAIDS lower urine volume and plasma Na+ by inhibiting prostaglandin synthase:
prostaglandins locally inhibit the action of ADH.
Emergency management
• Do urgent plasma U&E, and serum and urine osmolalities. Monitor urine output
carefully and check U&E twice a day initially.
• IVI to keep up with urine output. If severe hypernatraemia, do not lower Na+ rapidly
as this may cause cerebral oedema and brain injury. If Na+ is ≥170, use 0.9% saline
initially—this contains 150mmol/L of sodium. Aim to reduce Na+ at a rate of less
than 12mmol/L per day. Use of 0.45% saline can be dangerous.
• Desmopressin 2mcg IM (lasts 12–24h) may be used as a therapeutic trial.
16 DIDMOAD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder: Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy
and Deafness (also known as Wolfram’s syndrome).
17 Suspect neurosarcoidosis if CSF protein (seen in 34%), facial nerve palsy (25%), CSF pleocytosis (23%),
diabetes insipidus (21%), hemiparesis (17%), psychosis (17%), papilloedema (15%), ataxia (13%), seizures
(12%), optic atrophy (12%), hearing loss (12%), or nystagmus (9%).
18 Sheehan’s syndrome is pituitary infarction from shock, eg postpartum haemorrhage. It is rare.
19 Most of us could drink 20L/d and not be hyponatraemic; some get hyponatraemic drinking 5L/d; they
may have Psychosis, Intermittent hyponatraemia, and Polydipsia (PIP syndrome), ?from intravascular
volume leading to atrial natriuretic peptide, p137, hence natriuresis and hyponatraemia.

The 8-hour water deprivation test
Tests the ability of kidneys to concentrate urine for diagnosis of DI (dilute urine in
spite of dehydration), and then to localize the cause (table 5.5). Do not do the test
before establishing that urine volume is >3L/d (output less than this with normal
plasma Na+ and osmolality excludes signifi cant disturbance of water balance).
• Stop test if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 (DI is excluded).
• Free fl uids until 07.30. Light breakfast at 06.30, no tea, no coff ee, no smoking.
Stage 1 Fluid deprivation (0–8h): for diagnosis of DI. Start at 08.00.
• Empty bladder, then no drinks and only dry food.
• Weigh hourly. If >3% weight lost during test, order urgent serum osmolality. If
>300mOsmol/kg, proceed to Stage 2. If <300, continue test.
• Collect urine every 2h; measure its volume and osmolality.
• Venous sample for osmolality every 4h.
• Stop test after 8h (16.00) if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg (ie normal).
Stage 2 Diff erentiate cranial from nephrogenic DI.
• Proceed if urine still dilute—ie urine osmolality <600mOsmol/kg.
• Give desmopressin 2mcg IM. Water can be drunk now.
• Measure urine osmolality hourly for the next 4h.
Table 5.5 Interpreting the water deprivation test
Diagnosis Urine osmolality
Normal Urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 U:P ratio >2 (normal
concentrating ability)
Primary polydipsia Urine concentrates, but less than normal, eg >400–600mOsmol/kg
Cranial DI Urine osmolality increases to >600mOsmol/kg after desmopres-
sin (if equivocal an extended water deprivation test may be tried
(no drinking from 18:00 the night before))
Nephrogenic DI No increase in urine osmolality after desmopressin
Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)
In SIADH, ADH continues to be secreted in spite of low plasma osmolality or large
plasma volume. Diagnosis requires concentrated urine (Na+ >20mmol/L and osmo-
lality >100mOsmol/kg) in the presence of hyponatraemia and low plasma osmolal-
ity. Causes are numerous. See p673.

Lumen
We learn about gastroenterological diseases as if they were separate entities,
independent species collected by naturalists, each kept in its own dark match-
box—collectors’ items collecting dust in a desiccated world on a library shelf. But
this is not how illness works. Otto had diabetes, but refused to see a doctor until
it was far advanced, and an amputation was needed. He needed looking after
by his wife Aurelia. But she had her children Warren and Sylvia to look after
too. And when Otto was no longer the bread-winner, she forced herself to work
as a teacher, an accountant, and at any other job she could get. Otto’s illness
manifested in Aurelia’s duodenum—as an ulcer. The gut often bears the brunt of
other people’s worries. Inside every piece of a gut is a lumen1—the world is in the
gut, and the gut is in the world. But the light does not always shine. So when the
lumen fi lled with Aurelia’s blood, we can expect the illness to impact on the whole
family. Her daughter knows where blood comes from (‘straight from the heart …
pink fi zz’). After Otto died, Sylvia needed long-term psychiatric care, and Aurelia
moved to be near her daughter. The bleeding duodenal ulcer got worse when Syl-
via needed electroconvulsive therapy. The therapy worked and now, briefl y, Sylvia,
before her own premature death, is able to look after Aurelia, as she prepares for
a gastrectomy.
The story of each illness told separately misses something; but even taken
in its social context, this story is missing something vital—the poetry, in
most of our patients lived rather than written—tragic, comic, human, and
usually obscure—but in the case of this family not so obscure. Welling up,
as unstoppable as the bleeding from her mother’s ulcer came the poetry of
Sylvia Plath.
1 Lumen is Latin for light (hence its medical meaning of a tubular cavity open to the world at both ends),
as well as being the SI unit of light fl ux falling on an object—ie the power to i lluminate. All doctors have this
power, whether by insightfully interpreting patients’ lives and illnesses to them, or by acts of kindness—
even something so simple as bringing a cup of tea.

Healthy, enjoyable eating
‘There’s a lot of people in this world who spend so much time watching their
health that they haven’t the time to enjoy it.’ Josh Billings (1818–85).
Updates to guidelines on healthy eating perhaps provide fodder for journalists
who have been served a diet both rich and varied in apparently contradictory
advice. Nonetheless, for many of our increasingly overweight population, simply
eating less (eg 2500 calories/d for men and 2000 for women) and balancing in-
take across food groups seems a sensible start. Diet is of course not independent
of lifestyle, and we should continue to promote a balanced diet in the context of
the full range of public health messages. Unravelling these confounding threads in
population-level data will always pose a challenge—while some studies show veg-
etarians may be less likely to die from ischaemic heart disease, is this eff ect because
vegetarians in the UK are more likely to be non-smokers? Overly proscriptive applica-
tion of such population-level data in advice given to individuals (as journalists may
be prone to do) will always be fl awed and risks drowning important fundamental
concepts in a sea of cynicism.
Current recommendations must take into account three facts
• Obesity costs health services as much as smoking—1 in 4 UK adults is obese.
• Diabetes mellitus is burgeoning: in some places prevalence is >7% (p206).
• Past advice has not changed eating habits in large sections of the population.
Advice is likely to focus on the following
Body mass index: (BMI; table 6.1.) Aim for 18.5–25. Controlling quantity may be more
important than quality. In hypertension, eating the ‘right’ things lowers BP only mar-
ginally, but controlling weight causes a more signifi cant reduction.
Base meals on starch: (Bread, rice, potatoes, pasta.) These provide a slower re-
lease form of carbohydrate compared to diets containing refi ned sugar, and be-
ware of the high sugar contents of, eg soft drinks.
Eat enough fruit and vegetables: Aiming for 5 portions a day.
Eat foods high in fat, salt, or sugar infrequently.
Eat some meat, fi sh, eggs, and beans: Aim for 2 portions of fi sh a week, includ-
ing oily fi sh (those rich in omega-3 fatty acid, such as mackerel, herring, pilchards,
salmon). Non-dairy sources of protein include beans and nuts. Aim to reduce intake
of red or processed meat to <70g/day.
Eat some milk and dairy products: Select those options with lower fat, sugar and
salt where possible.
Moderate alcohol use (adults <65yrs): 14U/wk for both men and women, spread
over 3 or more days. There is no ‘safe’ level.
Supplements: There is scant evidence for most nutritional supplements in those
able to follow a balanced diet. Women attempting to conceive should take 400mcg/
day folic acid from (pre-)conception until at least 12wks. Vitamin D supplements
(10mcg/day) may benefi t breast-feeding mothers, those ≥65yrs old, those whose
skin is not typically exposed to sun, or those with very dark skin. Lower doses may be
recommended for infants and young children.
This diet is not appropriate for all: • <5yrs old. • Need for low residue (eg
Crohn’s, UC, p264) or special diet (coeliac disease, p266). Emphasis may be differ-
ent in: Dyslipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); obesity; constipation (p260); liver failure
(p274); chronic pancreatitis (p270); renal failure (less protein)(p304); BP (see p140).
Diffi culties It is an imposition to ask us to change our diet (children often refuse
point-blank); a more subtle approach is to take a food we enjoy (crisps) and make it
healthier (eg low-salt crisps made from jacket potatoes and fried in sunfl ower oil).

Losing weight—why and how?
The risks of too much sugar Excess sugar causes caries, diabetes, obesity—
which itself contributes to osteoarthritis, cancer, hypertension, and increased
oxi dative stress—so raising cardiovascular mortality and much more.
Losing weight Motivational therapy. Consider referral to a dietician—a needs-
specifi c diet may be best. In conjunction with exercise and diet strategies, tar-
geted weight-loss can also be achieved successfully with psychotherapy.
Drugs or surgery for obesity? The most desirable treatment for obesity is still
primary prevention, but pharmacotherapy does work. Orlistat lowers fat ab-
sorption (hence SE of oily faecal incontinence)—see OHCS p514. Surgery: Carries
potential for signifi cant weight loss in appropriately selected patients but also
signifi cant morbidity (see p626).
Calculating body mass index
Table 6.1 BMI=(weight in kg)/(height in m)2
BMI State Some implications within the categories
<18.5 Underweight Consider pathology (inc. eating disorder)
18.5–25 On target
25–30 Overweight Weight loss should be considered
30–40 Obesity >32 is unsuitable for day-case general surgery
>40 Extreme/morbid obesity >40 is an indication for bariatric surgery
Caveats: BMI does not take into account the distribution of body fat, and is harder
to interpret for children and adolescents. Waist circumference >94cm in men
and >80cm in women refl ects omental fat and correlates better with risk than
does BMI. BMI is still a valid way of comparing populations: average BMI in the USA
is 28.8; in Japan, 22. A nation can be lean without being poor. As nations continue
to adopt the lifestyle trends of the USA, this impacts sustainability.

The mouth
The diagnosis will often come out of your patient’s mouth, so open it! So many GI
investigations are indirect...now is your chance for direct observation.
Leucoplakia (fi g 6.2) Is an oral mucosal white patch that will not rub off and is
not attributable to any other known disease. It is a premalignant lesion, with a
transformation rate, which ranges from 0.6% to 18%. Oral hairy leucoplakia is a
shaggy white patch on the side of the tongue seen in HIV, caused by EBV. When
in doubt, refer all intra-oral white lesions (see BOX).
Aphthous ulcers (fi g 6.3) 20% of us get these shallow, painful ulcers on the
tongue or oral mucosa that heal without scarring. Causes of severe ulcers:
Crohn’s and coeliac disease; Behçet’s (p694); trauma; erythema multiforme; lichen
planus; pemphigus; pemphigoid; infections (herpes simplex, syphilis, Vincent’s
angina, p712). : Minor ulcers: avoid oral trauma (eg hard toothbrushes or foods
such as toast) and acidic foods or drinks. Tetracycline or antimicrobial mouth-
washes (eg chlorhexidine) with topical steroids (eg triamcinolone gel) and topical
analgesia. Severe ulcers: possible therapies include systemic corticosteroids (eg
oral prednisolone 30–60mg/d PO for a week) or thalidomide (absolutely contraindi-
cated in pregnancy). Biopsy any ulcer not healing after 3 weeks to exclude mal-
ignancy; refer to an oral surgeon if uncertain.
Candidiasis (thrush) (fi g 6.4) Causes white patches or erythema of the buccal mu-
cosa. Patches may be hard to remove and bleed if scraped. Risk factors: Extremes
of age; DM; antibiotics; immunosuppression (long-term corticosteroids, including in-
halers; cytotoxics; malignancy; HIV). : Nystatin suspension 400 000U (4mL swill and
swallow/6h). Fluconazole for oropharyngeal thrush.
Cheilitis (angular stomatitis) Fissuring of the mouth’s corners is caused by denture
problems, candidiasis, or defi ciency of iron or ribofl avin (vitamin B2). (fi g 8.5, p327.)
Gingivitis Gum infl ammation ± hypertrophy occurs with poor oral hygiene, drugs
(phenytoin, ciclosporin, nifedipine), pregnancy, vitamin C defi ciency (scurvy, p268),
acute myeloid leukaemia (p356), or Vincent’s angina (p712).
Microstomia (fi g 6.5) The mouth is too small, eg from thickening and tightening
of the perioral skin after burns or in epidermolysis bullosa (destructive skin and
mucous membrane blisters ± ankyloglossia) or systemic sclerosis (p552).
Oral pigmentation Perioral brown spots characterize Peutz–Jeghers’ (p708). Pig-
mentation anywhere in the mouth suggests Addison’s disease (p226) or drugs (eg
anti malarials). Consider malignant melanoma. Telangiectasia: Systemic sclerosis;
Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p708). Fordyce glands: (Creamy yellow spots at
the border of the oral mucosa and the lip vermilion.) Sebaceous cysts, common
and benign. Aspergillus niger colonization may cause a black tongue.
Teeth (fi g 6.6) A blue line at the gum–tooth margin suggests lead poisoning. Pre-
natal or childhood tetracycline exposure causes a yellow–brown discolouration.
Tongue This may be furred or dry (xerostomia) in dehydration, drug therapy,3 after
radiotherapy, in Crohn’s disease, Sjögren’s (p710), and Mikulicz’s syndrome (p706).
Glossitis: Means a smooth, red, sore tongue, eg caused by iron, folate, or B12 defi -
ciency (fi g 8.27, p335). If local loss of papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that change
in colour and size, use the term geographic tongue (harmless migratory glossitis).
Macroglossia: The tongue is too big. Causes: myxoedema; acromegaly; amyloid
(p370). A ranula is a bluish salivary retention cyst to one side of the frenulum,
named after the bulging vocal pouch of frogs’ throats (genus Rana).
Tongue cancer: Appears as a raised ulcer with fi rm edges. Risk factors: smoking,
alcohol.4 Spread: anterior ⅓ of tongue drains to submental nodes; middle ⅓ to sub-
mandibular nodes; posterior ⅓ to deep cervical nodes (see BOX, p599). Treatment:
Radiotherapy or surgery. 5yr survival (early disease): 80%. When in doubt, refer.
3 Drugs causing xerostomia: ACE-i; antidepressants; antihistamines; antipsychotics; antimuscarinics/
anti cholinergics; bromocriptine; diuretics; lo peramide; nifedipine; opiates; prazosin; prochlorperazine, etc.
4 Betel nut (Areca catechu) chewing, common in South Asia, may be an independent risk factor.

Endoscopy and biopsy
Consent is needed for all these procedures; see p568.
Upper GI endoscopy Indications: See table 6.2. Pre-procedure: Stop PPIS 2wks pre-
op if possible ( pathology-masking). Nil by mouth for 6h before. Don’t drive for 24h
if sedation is used. Procedure: Sedation optional, eg midazolam 1–5mg slowly IV (to
remain conscious; if deeper sedation is needed, propofol via an anaesthetist (narrow
therapeutic range)); nasal prong O2 (eg 2L/min; monitor respirations & oximetry). The
pharynx may be sprayed with local anaesthetic before the endoscope is passed. Con-
tinuous suction must be available to prevent aspiration. Complications: Sore throat;
amnesia from sedation; perforation (<0.1%); bleeding (if on aspirin, clopidogrel, war-
farin, or DOACS these need stopping only if therapeutic procedure). Duodenal biopsy:
The gold standard test for coeliac disease (p266); also useful in unusual causes of
malabsorption, eg giardiasis, lymphoma, Whipple’s disease.
Sigmoidoscopy Views the rectum + distal colon (to ~splenic fl exure). Flexible
sigmoidoscopy has largely displaced rigid sigmoidoscopy for diagnosis of distal
colonic pathology, but ~25% of cancers are still out of reach. It can be used thera-
peutically, eg for decompression of sigmoid volvulus (p611). Preparation: Phosphate
enema PR. Procedure: Learn from an expert; do PR exam fi rst. Do biopsies—macro-
scopic appearances may be normal, eg IBD, amyloidosis, microscopic colitis.
Colonoscopy Indications: See table 6.3. Preparation: Stop iron 1wk prior; dis-
cuss with local endoscopy unit bowel preparation and diet required. Procedure: Do
PR fi rst. Sedation (see earlier in topic) and analgesia are given before colonoscope is
passed and guided around the colon. Complications: Abdominal discomfort; incom-
plete examination; haemorrhage after biopsy or polypectomy; perforation (<0.1%).
See fi gs 6.7–6.11. Post-procedure: no alcohol, and no operating machinery for 24h.
Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) To evaluate obscure GI bleeding (p326) and to
detect small bowel pathology. Use small bowel imaging (eg contrast) or patency
capsule test ahead of VCE if patient has abdominal pain or symptoms suggesting
small bowel obstruction. Preparation: Clear fl uids only the evening before then
nil by mouth from morning until 4h after capsule swallowed. Procedure: Capsule is
swallowed (fi g 6.12)—this transmits video wirelessly to cap-
ture device worn by patient. Normal activity can take place
for the day. Complications: Capsule retention in 1% (endo-
scopic or surgical removal is needed)—avoid MRI for 2 wks
after unless AXR confi rms capsule has cleared; obstruction,
incomplete exam (eg slow transit, achalasia). Problems: No

therapeutic options; poor localization of lesions; may miss
more subtle lesions.
Liver biopsy Route: Percutaneous if INR in range else trans jugular with FFP. Indica-
tions: LFT of unknown aetiology; assessment of fi brosis in chronic liver disease (this
indication being replaced by ultrasound-based elastography); suspected cirrhosis or
suspected hepatic lesions/cancer. Pre-op: Nil by mouth for 8h. Are INR <1.5 and
platelets >50 ≈ 109/L? Give analgesia. Procedure: Sedation may be given. Do under
US/CT guidance; the liver borders are percussed and where there is dullness in the
mid-axillary line in expiration, lidocaine 2% is infi ltrated down to the liver capsule.
Breathing is rehearsed and a needle biopsy is taken with the breath held in expira-
tion. Afterwards lie on the right side for 2h, then in bed for 4h; check pulse and
BP every 15 mins for 1h, every 30 mins for 2h, then hourly until discharge 4h post-
biopsy. Complications: Local pain; pneumothorax; bleeding (<0.5%); death (<0.1%).

Dysphagia
Dysphagia is diffi culty in swallowing and should prompt urgent investigation to
exclude malignancy (unless of short duration, and associated with a sore throat).
Causes Oral, pharyngeal, or oesophageal? Mechanical or motility related? (See BOX
‘Causes of dysphagia’.)
Five key questions to ask
1 Was there diffi culty swallowing solids and liquids from the start?
Yes: motility disorder (eg achalasia, CNS, or pharyngeal causes).
No: Solids then liquids: suspect a stricture (benign or malignant).
2 Is it diffi cult to initiate a swallowing movement?
Yes: Suspect bulbar palsy, especially if patient coughs on swallowing.
3 Is swallowing painful (odynophagia)?
Yes: Suspect ulceration (malignancy, oesophagitis, viral infection or Candida in
immunocompromised, or poor steroid inhaler technique) or spasm.
4 Is the dysphagia intermittent or is it constant and getting worse?
Intermittent: suspect oesophageal spasm.
Constant and worsening: suspect malignant stricture.
5 Does the neck bulge or gurgle on drinking?
Yes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570).
Signs Is the patient cachectic or anaemic? Examine the mouth; feel for supraclavic-
ular nodes (left supraclavicular node = Virchow’s node—suggests intra-abdominal ma-
lignancy); look for signs of systemic disease, eg systemic sclerosis (p552), CNS disease.
Tests FBC (anaemia); U&E (dehydration). Upper GI endoscopy ± biopsy (fi g 6.13). If suspi-
cion of pharyngeal pouch consider contrast swallow (± ENT opinion). Video fl uoroscopy
may help identify neurogenic causes. Oesophageal manometry for dysmotility.
Specifi c conditions Oesophagitis: See p254. Diffuse oesophageal spasm: Causes in-
termittent dysphagia ± chest pain. Contrast swallow/manometry: abnormal contrac-
tions.5 Achalasia: Coordinated peristalsis is lost and the lower oesophageal sphincter
fails to relax (due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus), causing dysphagia, re-
gurgitation, and weight. Characteristic fi ndings on manometry or contrast swallow
showing dilated tapering oesophagus. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation, or
Heller’s cardiomyotomy—then proton pump inhibitors (PPIS, p254). Botulinum toxin in-
jection if a non-invasive procedure is needed (repeat every few months). Calcium chan-
nel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture:
Caused by gastro-oesophageal refl ux (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy.
Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal cancer: (p618.) Associations:
, GORD, tobacco, alcohol, Barrett’s oesophagus (p695), tylosis (palmar hyperkeratosis),
Plummer–Vinson syndrome (post-cricoid dysphagia, upper oesophageal web + iron-
defi ciency). CNS causes: Ask for help from a speech and language therapist.
Nausea and vomiting
Consider pregnancy where appropriate! Other causes, p56.
What’s in the vomit? Reports of ‘coff ee grounds’ may indicate upper GI bleeding
but represent one of the most over-called signs in clinical medicine — always verify
yourself and look for other evidence of GI bleeding; recognizable food ≈ gastric stasis;
feculent ≈ small bowel obstruction.
Timing Morning ≈ pregnancy or ICP; 1h post food ≈ gastric stasis/gastroparesis (DM);
vomiting that relieves pain ≈ peptic ulcer; preceded by loud gurgling ≈ GI obstruction.
Tests Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, glucose, amylase. ABG: A metabolic (hypochlor-
aemic) alkalosis from loss of gastric contents (pH >7.45, HCO3 Ω) indicates severe
vomiting. Plain AXR: If suspected bowel obstruction (p728). Upper GI endoscopy:
(See p248.) If suspicion of bleed or persistent vomiting. Consider head CT in case ICP.
Treatment Identify and treat underlying causes. Symptomatic relief: table 6.4. Be
pre-emptive, eg pre-op for post-op symptoms. Try oral route fi rst. 30% need a 2nd-line
anti-emetic, so be prepared to prescribe more than one. Give IV fl uids with K+ replace-
ment if severely dehydrated or nil-by-mouth, and monitor electrolytes and fl uid balance.

Dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease
War The stomach is a battle ground between the forces of attack (acid, pepsin, Helico-
bacter pylori, bile salts) and defence (mucin secretion, cellular mucus, bicarbonate
secretion, mucosal blood fl ow, cell turnover). Gastric antisecretory agents, eg H
2
re-
ceptor antagonists (H2RAS), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIS) may only work if you
have optimized cytoprotection (antacids and sucralfate work this way). Success may
depend on you being not just a brilliant general, but also a tactician, politician, and
diplomat. Plan your strategy carefully4 (fi g 6.14). As in any war, neglecting psycho-
logical factors can prove disastrous. The aim is not outright victory but maintaining
the balance of power so all may prosper.
Symptoms Epigastric pain often related to hunger, specifi c foods, or time of day,
fullness after meals, heart burn (retros ternal pain); tender epi gastrium. Beware
Alarm symptoms: Anaemia (iron defi ciency); loss of weight; anorexia; recent on-
set/progressive symptoms; melaena/haematemesis; swallowing diffi culty.
H. pylori (See table 6.5.) If 55yrs old: ‘Test and treat’ for H. pylori;6 if +ve give
appropriate PPI and 2 antibiotic combination, eg lansoprazole 30mg/12h PO,
clarithromycin 250mg/12h PO, and amoxicillin 1g/12h PO for 1wk. If Ωve give acid
suppression alone. Refer for urgent endoscopy (p248) all with dysphagia, as well
as those 55 with alarm symptoms or with treatment-refractory dyspepsia.
Duodenal ulcer (DU, fi g 6.15.) 4-fold commoner than GU. Major risk factors: H. py-
lori (90%); drugs (NSAIDS; steroids; SSRI). Minor: Gastric acid secretion; gastric
emptying (duodenal pH); blood group O; smoking.
Symptoms: Asympto matic or epigastric pain (relieved by antacids) ± weight. Signs:
Epigastric tenderness. Diagnosis: Upper GI endoscopy. Test for H. pylori. Measure
gastrin con cen trations when off PPIS if Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (p716) is sus-
pected. : Non-ulcer dyspepsia; duodenal Crohn’s; TB; lymphoma; pancreatic cancer
(p270). Follow-up: None; if good response to  (eg PPI).
Gastric ulcers (GU.) Occur mainly in the elderly, on the lesser curve. Ulcers else-
where are more often malignant. Risk factors: H. pylori (~80%); smoking; NSAIDS; re-
fl ux of duodenal contents; delayed gastric emptying; stress, eg neurosurgery or burns
(Cushing’s or Curling’s ulcers). Symptoms: Asymptom atic or epigastric pain (relieved
by antacids) ± weight. Tests: Upper GI endoscopy to exclude malignancy (fi g 6.14);
multiple biopsies from ulcer rim and base (histology, H. pylori). Repeat endoscopy af-
ter 6–8 weeks to confi rm healing and exclude malignancy.
Gastritis Risk factors: Alcohol, NSAIDS, H. pylori, refl ux/hiatus hernia, atrophic
gastritis, granulom as (Crohn’s; sarcoidosis), CMV, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome & Mé-
nétrier’s disease (p716 & 706). Symptoms: Epigastric pain, vomiting; Tests: Upper GI
endoscopy only if suspicious features (fi g 6.14).
Treatment Lifestyle: Alcohol and tobacco.
H. pylori eradication: Triple therapy is 80–85% eff ective at eradication.7
Drugs to reduce acid: PPIS are eff ective, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO for 4 (DU) or 8
(GU) wks. H2 blockers have a place (ranitidine 300mg each night PO for 8wks).
Drug-induced ulcers: Stop drug if possible. PPIS may be best for treating and pre-
venting GI ulcers and bleeding in patients on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Misopros-
tol is an alternative with diff erent SE. If symptoms persist, re-endoscope, retest for
H. pylori, and reconsider diff erential diagnoses (eg gallstones). Surgery: See p622.
Complications Bleeding (p256), perforation (p606), malignancy, gastric outfl ow.
Functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia Common. H. pylori eradication (only after a +ve
result) may help. Some evidence favours PPIS and psychotherapy. Low-dose ami-
triptyline (10–20mg each night PO) may help. Ant acids, antispasmodics, H2 blockers,
misoprostol, prokinetic agents, bismuth, or sucralfate all have less evidence.
6 H. pylori is the commonest bacterial pathogen found worldwide (>50% of the world population over
40yrs has it). It’s a class I carcinogen causing gastritis (p252), duodenal/gastric ulcers & gastric cancer/
lymphoma (MALT, p362), also associated with coronary artery disease, B12 and iron defi ciency.
7 1 week of therapy suffi cient; 2 weeks increases erradication rates by ~5% but also increases SE. For resist-
ant infections switch to a 2nd-line antibiotic combination (see BNF).

Gastro-oesophageal refl ux disease (GORD)
GORD is common, and caused by refl ux of stomach contents (acid ± bile)8 causing
troublesome symptoms and/or complications. If refl ux is prolonged, it may cause
oesoph agitis (fi g 6.16), benign oesophageal stricture, or Barrett’s oesophagus (fi g
6.17 and p695; it is pre-malignant). Causes Lower oesophageal sphincter hypoten-
sion, hiatus hernia (see BOX), oesophageal dysmotility (eg systemic sclerosis), obesity,
gastric acid hypersecretion, delayed gastric emptying, smoking, alcohol, pregnancy,
drugs (tricyclics, antic holinergics, nitrates), Helicobacter pylori?9
Symptoms Oesophageal: Heartburn (burning, retrosternal discomfort after meals,
lying, stooping, or straining, relieved by antacids); belching; acid brash (acid or bile
regurgitation); waterbrash ( salivation: ‘My mouth fi lls with saliva’); odynophagia
(painful swallowing, eg from oesophagitis or ulceration). Extra-oesophageal:
Nocturnal asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis (hoarseness, throat clearing), sinusitis.
Complications Oesophagitis, ulcers, benign stricture, iron-defi ciency. Metaplasia
dysplasianeoplasia: GORD may lead to Barrett’s oesophagus (p695; distal oe-
sophageal epithelium undergoes metaplasia from squamous to columnar, fi g 6.17).
0.1–0.4%/yr of those with Barrett’s progress to oesophageal cancer (higher if dys-
plasia is present).
 Oesophagitis from corrosives, NSAIDS, herpes, Candida; duodenal or gastric ul-
cers or cancers; non-ulcer dyspepsia; oesophageal spasm; cardiac disease.
Tests Endoscopy if dysphagia, or if ≥55yrs old with alarm symptoms (p252) or
with treatment-refractory dyspepsia. 24h oesophageal pH monitoring ± manom-
etry help diagnose GORD when endoscopy is normal.
Treatment Lifestyle: Weight loss; smoking cessation; small, regular meals; reduce
hot drinks, alcohol, citrus fruits, tomatoes, onions, fi zzy drinks, spicy foods, caff eine,
chocolate; avoid eating < 3h before bed. Raise the bed head.
Drugs: Antacids, eg magnesium trisilicate mixture (10mL/8h), or alginates, eg Gav-
iscon® (10–20mL/8h PO) relieve symptoms. Add a PPI, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO.
For refractory symptoms, add an H2 blocker and/or try twice-daily PPI. Avoid drugs
aff ecting oesophageal motility (nitrates, anticholinergics, Ca2+ channel blockers—re-
lax the lower oesophageal sphincter) or that damage mucosa (NSAIDS, K+ salts, bis-
phosphonates).
Surgery: (Eg laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, or novel options including
laparoscopic insertion of a magnetic bead band or radiofrequency-induced
hypertrophy.) These all aim to  resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.
Consider in severe GORD (confi rm by pH-monitoring/manometry) if drugs are not
working. Atypical symptoms (cough, laryngitis) are less likely to improve with
surgery compared to patients with typical symptoms.

8 The refl ux of duodenal fl uid, pancreatic secretions and bile may be as important as acid; it may re-
spond to similar lifestyle measures, sucralfate (2g/12h PO), domperidone, or metoclopramide.
9 H. pylori association with GORD controversial, but eradication may help symptoms.

Hiatus hernia
Sliding hiatus hernia (80%) The gastro-oesophageal junction slides up into the
chest—see fi g 6.18. Acid refl ux often happens as the lower oesophageal sphincter
becomes less competent in many cases.
Paraoesophageal hernia (rolling hiatus hernia) (20%) The gastro-oesophageal
junction remains in the abdomen but a bulge of stomach herniates up into the
chest alongside the oesophagus—see fi gs 6.18, 6.19. As the gastro-oesophageal
junction remains intact, GORD is less common.
Clinical features Common: 30% of patients >50yrs, especially obese women. Al-
though most small hernias are asymptomatic, patients with large hernias may
develop GORD.
Imaging Upper GI endoscopy vis ualizes the mucosa (?oesophagitis) but cannot
reliably exclude a hiatus hernia.
Treatment Lose weight. Treat GORD. Surgery indications: intractable symptoms
despite aggressive medical therapy, complications (see p254). Although paraoe-
sophageal hernias may strangulate the risk of this drops dramatically after 65
yrs. Prophylactic repair is only undertaken in those considered at high risk, due to
operative mortality (≈1–2%).

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
Haematemesis is vomiting of blood. It may be bright red or look like coff ee grounds.
Melaena (Greek melas = black) means black motions, often like tar, and has a char-
acteristic smell of altered blood. Both indicate upper GI bleeding.
Take a brief history and
Common causes Rare causes
examine to assess severity.
• Peptic ulcers • Bleeding disorders
Ask about past GI bleeds; • Mallory–Weiss tear • Portal hypertensive
dyspepsia/known ulcers;
• Oesophageal varices gastropathy
known liver disease or oes- • Gastritis/gastric erosions • Aorto-enteric fi stula10
ophageal varices (p257); • Drugs (NSAIDS, aspirin, • Angiodysplasia
dysphagia; vomiting; steroids, thrombolytics, • Haemobilia
weight loss. Check drugs anticoagulants) • Dieulafoy lesion11
(see BOX on common and • Oesophagitis • Meckel’s diverticulum
rare causes) and alcohol • Duodenitis • Peutz–Jeghers’ syndrome
use. Is there serious co- • Malignancy • Osler–Weber–Rendu
morbidity (bad prognosis), • No obvious cause syndrome.
eg cardiovascular disease,
respiratory disease, hepatic or renal impairment, or malignancy? Look for signs
of chronic liver disease (p276) and do a PR to check for melaena. Is the patient
shocked? Also:
• Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refi ll time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h.
• GCS (tricky to assess in decompensated liver disease) or encephalopathy (p275).
• Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm).
• Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg.
• Calculate the Rockall score (tables 6.6, 6.7).
Acute management (p820.) Skill in resuscitation determines survival, so get good
at this! Summary:5 start by protecting the airway and giving high-fl ow O 2, then:
 Insert 2 large-bore (14–16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC (early Hb may be
normal because haemodilution has not yet taken place), U&E (urea out of propor-
tion to creatinine indicative of massive blood meal), LFT, clotting, and crossmatch.
 Give IV fl uids (p821) to restore intravascular volume while waiting for cross-
matched blood. If haemodynamically deteriorating despite fl uid resuscitation,
give group O RhΩve blood. Avoid saline if cirrhotic/varices.
 Insert a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.
 Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.
 Consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fl uid replacement.
 Transfuse (with crossmatched blood if needed) if signifi cant Hb drop (<70g/L).
 Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).
 If suspicion of varices then give terlipressin IV eg 1–2mg/6h for ≤3d; relative risk
of death  by 34%. Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotic cover.
 Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH2O) at least hourly until stable.
 Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).
 If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/
embolization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding,
a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be
placed by someone with experience.
Further management Anatomy is important in assessing risk of rebleeding.
Posterior DUs are highest risk as they are nearest to the gastroduodenal artery.
• Re-examine after 4h and consider the need for FFP if >4 units transfused.
• Hourly pulse, BP, CVP, urine output (4hrly if haemo dynamically stable may be OK).
• Transfuse to keep Hb >70g/L; ensure a current valid group & save sample.
• Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and clotting daily.
• Keep nil by mouth if at high rebleed risk (see BOX ‘Management of peptic ulcer
bleeds’ and p256)—ask the endoscopist.
10 A patient with an aortic graft repair and upper GI bleeding is considered to have an aorto-enteric fi stula
until proven otherwise: CT abdomen is usually required as well as endoscopy.
11 A Dieulafoy lesion is the rupture of an unusually big arteriole, eg in the fundus of the stomach.

Initial Rockall score is based on pre-endoscopy criteria; these are added to post-
endoscopy criteria for fi nal score which predicts risk of rebleeding and death (ta-
ble 6.7). The Glas gow Blatchford score (GBS) is used pre-endoscopy to identify
patients at low risk of requiring intervention. If GBS ≈ 0, admission can be avoid-
ed—ie Hb 130g/L (or 120g/L if ); systolic BP 110mmHg; pulse <100/min; urea
<6.5mmol/L; no melaena or syncope + no past/present liver disease or heart failure.

Management of peptic ulcer bleeds based on endoscopic fi ndings
High-risk Active bleeding, adherent clot, or non-bleeding visible vessel. Achieve
endoscopic haemostasis (2 of: clips, cautery, adrenaline). Admit to monitored bed;
start PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO; meta-analyses show 72h IVI eg omepra-
zole 80mg bolus then 8mg/h not superior). If haemodynamically stable start oral
intake of clear liquids 6h after endoscopy. Treat if positive for H. pylori (p253).
Low-risk Flat, pigmented spot or clean base. No need for endoscopic haemo-
stasis. Consider early discharge if patient otherwise low risk. Give oral PPI (p252).
Regular diet 6h after endoscopy if stable. Treat if positive for H. pylori (p253).
Gastro-oesophageal varices
Submucosal venous dilatation 2° to portal pressures (may not have documented
liver disease—suspect varices if alcohol history); bleeding can be brisk, particularly
if underlying coagulopathy 2° to loss of hepatic synthesis of clotting factors.
Causes of portal hypertension Pre-hepatic: Thrombosis (portal or splenic vein).
Intra-hepatic: Cirrhosis (80% in UK); schistosomiasis (commonest worldwide); sar-
coid; myeloproliferative diseases; congenital hepatic fi brosis. Post-hepatic: Budd–
Chiari syndrome (p696); right heart failure; constrictive pericarditis; veno-occlusive
disease. Risk factors for variceal bleeds: Portal pressure, variceal size, endo-
scopic features of the variceal wall and advanced liver disease.
Management Endoscopic banding (oesophageal) or sclerotherapy (gastric).
Prophylaxis: 1°: ~30% of cirrhotics with varices bleed vs ~15% with non-selective
-blockade (propranolol 20–40mg/12h PO) or repeat endoscopic banding. 2°: after a
1st variceal bleed, 60% rebleed within 1yr. Use banding and non-selective -blockade;
transjugular intrahepatic porto–systemic shunt (TIPS) for resistant varices.

Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is characterized by increased stool frequency and volume and decreased
consistency—though patients’ perspectives of these may vary wildly.
History As ever, a careful history will help narrow myriad causes to just a few. Acute or
chronic? If acute (<2wks) suspect gastroenteritis—any risk factors: Travel? Diet change?
Contact with D&V? Any fever/pain? HIV; achlorhydria, eg PA, p334, or on acid suppressants,
eg PPI? Chronic diarrhoea alternating with constipation sugge sts irritable bowel (p266).
Weight, noct ur nal diarrhoea, or anaemia mandate close follow-up (coeliac/UC/Crohn’s?).
Bloody diarrhoea: Campylobacter, Shigella/Salmonella (p431), E. coli, amoebiasis
(p432), UC, Crohn’s, colorectal cancer (p616), colonic polyps, pseudomembranous co-
litis, ischaemic colitis (p620). Fresh PR bleeding: p629.
Mucus: Occurs in IBS (p266), colorectal cancer, and polyps.
Frank pus: Suggests IBD, diver ticulitis, or a fi stula/abscess.
Explosive: Eg cholera; Giardia; Yersinia (p425); Rotavirus.
Steatorrhoea: Characterized by gas, off ensive smell, and fl oating, hard-to-fl ush
stools—consider pancreatic insuffi ciency (p267) or biliary obstruction.
Look for Dehydration—dry mucous membranes, skin turgor; capillary refi ll >2s;
shock. Any fever, weight, clubbing, anaemia, oral ulcers (p246), rashes or abdominal
mass or scars? Any goitre/hyperthyroid signs? Do rectal exam for masses (eg rectal
cancer) or impacted faeces:
• Blood: FBC: MCV/Fe defi ciency, eg coeliac or colon ca; MCV if alcohol abuse or B12 ab-
sorption, eg in coeliac or Crohn’s; eosinophilia if parasites. ESR/CRP: infection, Crohn’s/
UC, cancer. U&E: K+ ≈ severe D&V. TSH: thyrotoxicosis. Coeliac serology: p266.
• Stool: MC&S: bacterial pathogens, ova cysts, parasites, C. diff toxin (CDT, see BOX
‘Causes of diarrhoea’), viral PCR. Faecal elastase: if suspect chronic pancreatitis (ma-
labsorption, steatorrhoea).
• Lower GI endoscopy: (Malignancy? colitis?) If acutely unwell, limited fl exible sim-
goidoscopy with biopsies. Full colonoscopy (including terminal ileum) can assess for
more proximal disease If normal, cons ider small bowel radiology or video capsule.
Management Treat cause. Food handlers: no work until stool samples are –ve. If a
hospital outbreak, wards may need closing. Oral rehydration is better than IV, but if
sustained diarrhoea or vomiting, IV fl uids with appropriate electrolyte replacement
may be needed. Codeine phosphate 30mg/8h PO or loperamide 2mg PO after each loose
stool (max 16mg/day) stool frequency (avoid in colitis; both may precipitate toxic
megacolon). Avoid antibiotics unless infective diarrhoea is causing systemic upset
(fi g 6.20). Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea12 may respond to probiotics (eg lactobacilli).
Causes of diarrhoea
Common Non-GI or rare causes
• Gastroenteritis (p428) • Thyrotoxicosis
• Traveller’s diarrhoea (p429) • Autonomic neuropathy
• C. diffi cile (BOX ‘Clostridium diffi cile’) • Addison’s disease
• IBS (p266) • Ischaemic colitis
• Colorectal cancer • Tropical sprue •Pellagra
• Crohn’s; UC; coeliac. • Gastrinoma •VIPoma14
Less common causes (Esp. if painful) • Carcinoid •Amyloid.
• Microscopic colitis13 Drugs
• Chronic pancreatitis (Many, see BNF.)
• Bile salt malabsorption • Antibiotics12 • PPI
• Laxative abuse • Propran olol • NSAIDS
• Lactose intolerance • Cytotoxics • Digoxin
• Ileal/gastric resection • Laxatives • Alcohol.
• Overfl ow diarrhoea
• Bacterial overgrowth.
12 Erythromycin is prokinetic, others cause overgrowth of bowel organisms, or alter bile acids.
13 Think of this in any chronic watery diarrhoea; diagnosis by biopsy. Associated with a range of drugs
including NSAIDS and PPIS. Stop the off ending drug where possible. Treat with budesonide.
14 Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumour; suspect if  K+and acidosis;  Ca2+;  Mg2+.

Managing infective diarrhoea*
No systemic signs Systemic illness: Special circumstances:
• Fever >39°C; dehydration • Food poisoning
• Diarrhoea + visible blood outbreak
(=dysentery) for >2wks • Travel (p428 & p430)
• Recent antibiotic use
• Rectal intercourse
• Admit to hospital; oral fl uids • Immunocompromised
Symptomatic  • Consider presumptive † unle ss • Raw seafood ingestion
a non-infectious cause is found
Stool culture Prompt, direct faecal Routine culture
not needed smear (then culture) and microscopy. Ask
microbiologist about 
Polymorphs seen No polymorphs seen Parasites seen
Likely culture: Likely culture: Specifi c , eg
• Shigella† • Salmonella† p432–435

More rarely: ‘Clostridium diffi cile’)
• C. diffi cile (see BOX Culture Ωve causes:
‘Clostridium diffi cile’) • eg Norovirus (eg with
• Yersinia enterocolitica projectile vomiting,
• Salmonella p430)
Fig 6.20 Managing infective diarrhoea.
*Be aware of local pathogens, and be prepared to close wards and hospitals if contagion is afoot.
†Prompt specifi c : eg ciprofl oxacin 500mg/12h PO for 6d may be needed before sensitivities are known.
Metronidazole is also tried, as Giardia is a common cause of watery diarrhoea in travellers.
Clostridium diffi cile: the cause of pseudomembranous colitis
First isolated from stools of healthy neonates, C. diffi cile was named owing to dif-
fi culties in culture. Today, ‘diffi cile’ might better refer to challenges of containment.
Signs: T°; colic; diarrhoea with systemic upset—CRP, WCC, albumin, and
colitis (with yellow adherent plaques on infl amed non-ulcerated mucosa—the
pseudomembrane) progressing to toxic megacolon and multi-organ failure.
Asymptomatic carriage: 2–5% of all adults. Only problematic with gut ecology
disrupted by, eg antibiotics, leading to rapid proliferation and toxin expression.
Predictors of fulminant C. diff colitis: >70yrs, past C. diff infection; use of anti-
peristaltic drugs; severe leucocytosis; haemodynamic instability.
Detection: Urgent testing of suspicious stool (characteristic smell—ask the
nurses). Two-stage process with rapid screening test for C. diff protein (or PCR)
followed by specifi c ELISA for toxins. AXR for toxic megacolon.
: Stop causative antibiotic if possible. Mild disease: metronidazole 400mg/8h PO for
10–14d (vanco mycin 125mg/6h PO is better in severe disease). Intensive regimens of
vancomycin 500mg/6h with IV and PR vancomycin may be needed for non-respond-
ers. Urgent colectomy may be needed if toxic megacolon, LDH, or if deteriorating.
Recurrent disease: Common (≈25%). Fidaxomicin, a minimally absorbed oral an-
tibiotic, is associated with lower relapse rates. Faecal transplantation (introduction
of a suspension prepared from the faeces of a screened donor via endoscopy or via
NG/NJ tube) is a highly eff ective, if aesthetically unappealing, method of treatment.
Preventing spread: Meticulous cleaning and appropriate bed management policies,
use of disposable gloves and aprons, hand-washing (not just gel—kill the spores).

Constipation
Constipation refl ects pelvic dysfunction or transit time. Accepted defi nitions and
reported rates vary, but a place to start is the passage of ≤2 bowel motions/wk,
often passed with diffi culty, straining, or pain, and a sense of incomplete evacua-
tion. :≈2:1. Doctors’ chief concerns are to fi nd pointers to major pathology, eg
constip ation + rectal bleeding ≈ cancer; constipation + distension + active bowel
sounds ≈ stricture/GI obstruction; constipation + menorrhagia ≈ hypothyroidism.
The patient Ask about frequency, nature, and consistency of stools. Is there blood
or mucus in/on the stools? Is there diarrhoea alternating with constipation (eg IBS,
p266)? Has there been recent change in bowel habit? Is she digitating the rectum
or vagina to pass stool?15 Ask about diet and drugs. PR examination is essential
even when referring (refer if signs of colorectal ca, eg weight, pain, or anaemia).
Tests None in young, mildly aff ected patients. Threshold for investigation di-
minishes with age; triggers include:6 weight, abdominal mass, +PR blood, iron
defi ciency anaemia. Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca2+, TFT. Colonoscopy: If suspected colo-
rectal malignancy. Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung’s
are occasionally needed.
Treatment Often reassurance, drinking more, and diet/exercise advice (p245) is
all that is needed. Treat causes (BOX ‘Causes of constipation’). A high-fi bre diet
is often advised, but may cause bloating without helping constipation. Only use
drugs if these measures fail, and try to use them for short periods only. Often,
a stimulant such as senna ± a bulking agent is more eff ective and cheaper than
agents such as lactulose. Bulking agents: Faecal mass, so stimulating peristal-
sis. They must be taken with plenty of fl uid and may take a few days to act. CI:
diffi culty in swallowing; GI obstruction; colonic atony; faecal impaction. Bran
powder 3.5g 2–3 times/d with food (may hinder absorption of dietary trace ele-
ments if taken with every meal). Ispaghula husk, eg 1 Fybogel® sachet after a
meal, mixed in water and swallowed promptly (or else it becomes an unpleasant
sludge). Methylcellulose, eg Celevac® 3–6 tablets/12h with ≥300mL water. Ster-
culia, eg Normacol® granules, 10mL sprinkled on food daily. Stimulant laxatives:
Increase intestinal motility, so do not use in intestinal obstruction or acute colitis.
Avoid prolonged use as it may cause colonic atony. Abdominal cramps are an
important SE. Pure stimulant laxatives are bisacodyl tablets (5–10mg at night) or
suppositories (10mg in the mornings) and senna (2–4 tablets at night). Docusate
sodium and dantron16 have stimulant and softening actions. Glycerol supposito-
ries act as a rectal stimulant. Sodium picosulfate (5–10mg at night) is a potent
stimulant. Stool softeners: Particularly useful when managing painful anal condi-
tions, eg fi ssure. Arachis oil enemas lubricate and soften impacted faeces. Liquid
paraffi n should not be used for a prolonged period (SE: anal seepage, lipoid pneu-
monia, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins). Osmotic laxatives: Retain fl uid in
the bowel. Lactulose, a semisynthetic disaccharide, produces osmotic diarrhoea
of low faecal pH that discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms. It
is useful in hepatic encepha lopathy (initial dose: 30–50mL/12h). SE: bloating, so
its role in treating constipation is limited. Macrogol (eg Movicol®) is another ex-
ample. Magnesium salts (eg magnesium hydroxide; magnesium sulfate) are use-
ful when rapid bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts (eg Microlette® and
Micralax® enemas) should be avoided as they may cause sodium and water re-
tention. Phosphate enemas are useful for rapid bowel evacuation prior to proce-
dures.
If these don’t help Prucalopride is an elective 5HT4 agonist with prokinetic prop-
erties; Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal fl uid
secretion; Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that also increases fl uid se-
cretion and decreases visceral pain. A multidisciplinary approach with behaviour
therapy, habit training ± sphincter biofeedback may help.
15 Rectocele: front wall of the rectum bulges into the back wall of the vagina.
16 Dantron causes colon & liver tumours in animals, so reserve use for the very elderly or terminally ill.

Defi ning gastrointestinal dysfunction—the Rome criteria
‘Here was history in the stones of the street and the atoms of the sunshine...
she went about in a kind of repressed ecstasy of contemplation, seeing often...
a great deal more than was there.’
Henry James, The Portrait of a Lady.
While the tools of contemporary gastroenterology are well placed to explore the
comparatively simple domains of structural lesions and infl ammation, for those
patients troubled by ‘functional’ disorders of motility and pain, we lack methods
to understand nervous activity in their guts. Instead, unlike James’ heroine Isabel
Archer, as she explored late 19th-century Rome, we are left seeing a greal deal less
than perhaps is there. The failure to see, then becomes a failure to comprehend
(the endoscopy and CT were normal, so there must be nothing wrong?)—then a
failure to believe and ultimately to treat an illness.
Before we subject any intervention to the rigors of medical trials, we should fi rst
agree a classifi cation of the disease process we are aiming to treat. Some of medi-
cine’s darkest alcoves refl ect less a lack of potential treatments and more a lack of
any agreement on where classifi cation boundaries lie. Failure to defi ne and distin-
guish pathologies then leads to a literature studded with small confl icting studies
on heterogeneous patients which feeds a perception of a condition as ‘untreatable’.
There is nothing romantic about constipation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction
in general, other than the association of the defi nitions of these disorders with
Rome. By the late 1980s, these confused areas exemplifi ed the above-described
challenges. Recognition of the need for order and classifi cation to support studies
led to an international collaboration, born out of the University of Rome. A process
of expert debate and discussion reached consensus defi nitions that could support
scientifi c studies. The experts then periodically reconvene in the eternal city to
revisit and evaluate these ‘Rome consensus’ defi nitions. Rather more prosaically,
the Rome foundation itself is now headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.

Ulcerative colitis (UC)
UC is a relapsing and remitting infl ammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa. It may
aff ect just the rectum (proctitis, as in ~30%) or extend to involve part of the colon (left-
sided colitis, in ~40%) or the entire colon (pancolitis, in ~30%). It ‘never’ spreads proxi-
mal to the ileocaecal valve (except for backwash ileitis). Cause Inappropriate immune
response against (?abnormal) colonic fl ora in genetically susceptibile individuals. Pa-
thology Hyperaemic/haemorrhagic colonic mucosa ± pseudop olyps formed by in-
fl ammation. Punctate ulcers may extend deep into the lamina propria—infl ammation
is norm ally not transmural. Continuous infl ammation limited to the mucosa diff erenti-
ates it from Crohn’s disease. Prevalence 100–200/100 000. Incid ence 10–20/100 000/
yr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. UC is 3-fold as common in non-smokers (the opposite
is true for Crohn’s disease)—symptoms may relapse on stopping smoking.
Symptoms Episodic or chronic diarrhoea (± blood & mucus); crampy abdomi nal
dis comfort; bowel frequency relates to severity (see table 6.8); urgency/tenes-
mus ≈ proctitis. Systemic symptoms in attacks: fever, malaise, anorexia, weight.
Signs May be none. In acute, severe UC there may be fever, tachycardia, and a ten-
der, distended abdomen. Extraintestinal signs: Clubbing; aphthous oral ulcers; ery-
thema nodosum (p265); pyoderma gangrenosum; conjunctivitis; episcleritis; iritis;
large joint arthritis; sacroiliitis; ankylosing spondylitis; PSC (p282); nutritional defi cits.
Tests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, blood culture. Stool MC&S/CDT: (See p258.) To
exclude Campylobacter, C. diffi cile, Sal monella, Shigella, E. coli, amoebae. Faecal
calprotectin: A simple, non-invasive test for GI infl ammation with high sensitivity.
AXR: No faecal shadows; mucosal thickening/islands (fi g 16.9, p729); colonic dilata-
tion (see ‘Complications’). Lower GI endoscopy: Limited fl exible sigmoidoscopy if
acute to assess and biopsy; full colonoscopy once controlled to defi ne disease extent
(see p249, fi g 6.10).
Table 6.8 Assessing severity in UC (Truelove & Witts criteria modifi ed to include CRP)
Variable Mild UC Moderate UC Severe UC
Motions/day ≤4 5 ≥6
Rectal bleeding Small Moderate Large
T°C Apyrexial 37.1–37.8°C >37.8°C
Resting pulse <70 beats/min 70–90 beats/min >90 beats/min
Haemoglobin >110g/L 105–110g/L <105g/L
ESR (do CRP too) <30 >30 (or CRP >45mg/L)
Data from Truelove et al., ‘Cortisone in ulcerative colitis’, BMJ; 2(4947): 1041–8.
Complications Acute: Toxic dilatation of colon (mucosal islands, colonic diameter
>6cm) with risk of perforation; venous thromboembolism: give prophylaxis to all in-
patients regardless of rectal bleeding (p350); K+ Chronic: Colonic cancer: risk related
to disease extent and activity ≈5–10% with pancolitis for 20yrs. Neoplasms may oc-
cur in fl at, normal-looking mucosa. To spot precursor areas of dysplasia, surveillance
colonoscopy eg 1–5yrs (depending on risk), with multiple random biopsies or biopsies
guided by diff erential uptake by abnormal mucosa of dye sprayed endoscopically.
Treatment Goals are to induce, then maintain disease remission.7
Mild UC: • 5-ASA,17 eg mesalazine (=mesalamine) is the mainstay for remission-induc-
tion/maintenance. Given PR (suppositories or enemas) for distal disease (eg Pen-
tasa® 1g daily); or PO for more extensive disease (eg Pentasa® 2g daily; once-daily
dosing as eff ective as split dose; combine PR+PO if fl are). • Topical steroid foams PR (eg
hydrocortisone as Colifoam®), or prednisolone 20mg retention enemas (Predsol®)
less eff ective than PR 5-ASA but may be added in addition.
Moderate UC: If 4–6 motions/day, but otherwise well, induce remission with oral
prednisolone 40mg/d for 1wk, then taper by 5mg/week over following 7wks. Then
maintain on 5-ASA (SES: rash, haemolysis, hepa titis, pancreatitis, paradoxical wors-
ening of colitis monitor FBC and U&E at start, then at 3 months, then annually).
17 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA or mesalazine) must be stabilized in oral preparations to survive gastric
pH. Alternatively, olsalazine is a dimer of 5-ASA or balsalazide is a prodrug, both of which are cleaved in the
colon. Rare hypersensitivity reactions: worsening colitis, pancreatitis, pericarditis, nephritis.

ygoloretneortsaG
Severe UC: If unwell and 6 motions/d, admit for: IV hydration/electrolyte replace-
ment; IV steroids, eg hydrocortisone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h;
rectal steroids, eg hydrocortisone 100mg in 100mL 0.9% saline/12h PR; thromboem-
bolism prophylaxis (p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection.
• Monitor T°, pulse, and BP—and record stool frequency/character on a stool chart.
• Twice-daily exam: document distension, bowel sounds, and tenderness.
• Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E ± AXR. Consider blood transfusion (eg if Hb <80g/L).
• If on day 3–5 CRP >45 or >6 stools/d, action is needed.18 Rescue therapy with ciclo-
sporin or infl iximab, can avoid colectomy, but involve surgeons early in shared care.
• If improving, transfer to prednisolone PO (40mg/24h). Schedule maintenance infl ixi-
mab if used for rescue, or azathioprine if ciclosporin rescue.
• If fails to improve then urgent colectomy by d7–10—the challenge is not to delay
surgery so long as to accumulate signifi cant steroid exposure and debilitation that
will delay post-surgical recovery.
It’s time for immunomodulation if... Patients fl are on steroid tapering or require
≥2 courses of steroids/year eg azathioprine (2–2.5mg/kg/d PO). 30% of patients will
develop SES requiring treatment cessation including abdominal pain, nausea, pan-
creatitis, leucopenia, abnormal LFTS. Monitor FBC, U+E, LFT weekly for 4 wks, then every
4 wks for 3 months, then at least 3-monthly.
Biologic therapy For patients intolerant of immunomodulation, or developing symp-
toms despite an immunomodulator, monoclonal antibodies to TNF (infl iximab, adali-
mumab, golimumab) or to adhesion molecules involved in gut lymphocyte traffi cking
(vedolizumab) play an important role (see BOX ‘Therapies in Crohn’s disease’ p265).
Surgery This is needed at some stage in ~20%, eg subtotal colectomy + terminal
ileostomy for failure of medical therapy or fulminant colitis with toxic dilatation/
perforation. Subsequently completion proctectomy (permanent stoma) vs ileo–anal
pouch. Pouches mean stoma reversal and the possibility of long-term continence but
pouch opening frequency may still be around 6≈/day and recurrent pouchitis can be
troublesome (give antib iotics, eg metronidazole + ciprofl oxacin for 2wks).
Diagnosing IBD-unclassifi ed (IBD-U)
After full investigation, IBD may not obviously be Crohn’s or UC. IBD-U refers
to isolated colonic IBD where the diagnosis remains unknown (small bowel
involvement=Crohn’s). This situation is rare in adults but commoner in children.
Over time the phenotype tends to become clearer (generally UC>Crohn’s). Colecto-
my ± pouch formation may be needed, though pouch failure rate is higher than in UC.
18 Day 3 stool frequency >8≈/day or frequency 3–8≈/day & CRP >45 =85% chance of colectomy this admission.

Crohn’s disease
A chronic infl ammatory disease characterized by transmural granulomatous infl am-
mation aff ecting any part of the gut from mouth to anus (esp. terminal ileum in
~70%). Unlike UC, there is unaff ected bowel between areas of active disease (skip
lesions). Cause As with UC an inappropriate immune response against the (?abnor-
mal) gut fl ora in a genetically susceptible individual.19 Prevalence 100–200/100 000.
Incidence 10–20/100 000/yr; typically presents ~20–40yrs. Associations Smoking
risk ≈3–4; NSAIDS may exacerbate disease.
Symptoms Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss/failure to thrive. Systemic
symptoms: fatigue, fever, malaise, anorexia.
Signs Bowel ulceration (fi g 6.22); abdominal tenderness/mass; perianal abscess/
fi stulae/skin tags; anal strictures. Beyond the gut: (fi g 6.21) Clubbing, skin, joint, &
eye problems.
Complications Small bowel obstruction; toxic dilatation (colonic diameter >6cm,
toxic dilatation is rarer than in UC); abscess formation (abdominal, pelvic, or peri-
anal); fi stulae (present in ~10%), eg entero-enteric, colovesical (bladder), colovagi-
nal, perianal, enterocutaneous; perforation; colon cancer; PSC (p282), malnutrition.
Tests Blood: FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, INR, ferritin, TIBC, B12, folate. Stool: MC&S and CDT
(p258) to exclude eg C. diffi cile, Campylobacter, E. coli; faecal calprotectin is a sim-
ple, non-invasive test for GI infl ammation with high sensitivity. Colonoscopy + bi-
opsy: Even if mucosa looks normal. Small bowel: To detect isolated proximal disease
by eg capsule endoscopy (p248, use dummy patency capsule 1st that disintegrates if
it gets stuck); MRI increasingly used to assess pelvic disease and fi stulae, small bowel
disease activity and strictures; US in skilled hands can provide small bowel imaging.
Treatment (See BOX.8) Find out how your patient deals with what may be a brutal
disease (no intimacy...no sex...no hope...‘I live with this alone and will die alone’). With
a collaborative approach, courage, attention to detail, and a dose of humour, this can
change. Help quit smoking. Optimize nutrition. Assess severity: T°, pulse, ESR,
WCC, CRP, + albumin may merit admission for IV steroids.
Mild–moderate: Symptomatic but systemically well. Prednisolone 40mg/d PO for
1wk, then taper by 5mg every wk for next 7wks. An alternative dietary approach
based upon ‘elemental’ or ‘polymeric’ diets is eff ective in children but less used for
adults. Plan maintenance therapy (see BOX).
Severe: Admit for IV hydration/electrolyte replacement; IV steroids, eg hydrocorti-
sone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h; thromboembolism prophylaxis
(p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection.
• Monitor T°, pulse, BP, and record stool frequency/character on a stool chart.
• Physical examination daily. Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, and plain AXR.
• Consider need for blood transfusion (if Hb <80g/L) and nutritional support.
• If improving switch to oral prednisolone (40mg/d). If not, biologics have a role.
• Consider abdominal sepsis complicating Crohn’s disease especially if abdominal
pain (ultrasound, CT, & MRI are often required to assess this). Seek surgical advice.
Perianal disease: Occurs in about 50%. MRI and examination under anaesthetic
(EUA) are an important part of assessment. Treatment includes oral antibiotics, im-
munosuppressant therapy ± anti-TNF, and local surgery ± seton insertion.
19 Much of the genetic risk is shared with UC—small diff erences in genetics combined with environmental
modifi ers may explain the very diff erent phenotypes.

Therapies in Crohn’s disease
Azathioprine (AZA) (2–2.5mg/kg/d PO) used if refractory to steroids, relapsing on
steroid taper, or requiring ≥2 steroid courses/yr. Takes 6–10wks to work. 30% will
develop SES requiring treatment cessation including abdominal pain, nausea, pancre-
atitis, leucopenia, abnormal LFTS. Monitor FBC, U&E, LFT weekly for 4wks, then every
4wks for 3 months, then at least 3-monthly. Alternative immunomodulators include
6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate (CI:  of reproductive age).
5-ASA Unlike in UC, have no role in the management of Crohn’s.
Biologics Anti-TNF: TNF plays an important role in pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease,
therefore monoclonal antibodies to TNF, eg infl iximab and adalimumab, can disease
activity. They counter neutrophil accumulation and granuloma formation and cause
cytotoxicity to CD4+ T cells, thus clearing cells driving the immune response. These
drugs play a vital role in both induction and maintenance therapy. CI: sepsis, active/
latent TB, LFT >3-fold above top end of normal. SE: rash. Avoid in people with known un-
derlying malignancy. TB may reactivate when on infl iximab, so screen patients before
starting the treatment (CXR, PPD, interferon gamma release assay (IGRA)). Combined
AZA and infl iximab can  effi cacy of  at 12 months, but there are long-term safety
issues (eg increased lymphoma risk). Anti-integrin: Monoclonal antibodies targeting
adhesion molecules involved in gut lymphocyte traffi cking, eg vedolizumab, reduce
disease activity and have a more gut-specifi c mechanism of activiy. Anti-IL12/23: Rep-
resents a new cytokine target with an emerging role in treatment, eg ustekinumab.
Nutrition Enteral is preferred (eg polymeric diet); consider TPN as a last resort.
Elemental diets: (Eg E028®.) Contain amino acids and can give remission. Low
residue diets: Help symptoms in those with active disease or strictures.
Surgery 50–80% need ≥1 operation in their life. It never cures. Indications: drug
failure (most common); GI obstruction from stricture; perforation; fi stulae; ab-
scess. Surgical aims are: 1 resection of aff ected areas—but beware short bowel
syndrome (p580) 2 to control perianal or fi stulizing disease 3 defunction (rest)
distal disease eg with a temporary ileostomy. Pouch surgery is avoided in Crohn’s
(  risk of recurrence).
Poor prognosis Age <40yrs; steroids needed at 1st presentation; perianal disease;
isolated terminal ileitis; smoking.

Gastrointestinal malabsorption
Causes See BOX ‘Causes of gastrointestinal malabsorption’.
Symptoms Diarrhoea; weight; lethargy; steatorrhoea; bloating.
Defi ciency signs Anaemia (Fe, B12, folate); bleeding disorders (vit K); oedema
(protein); metabolic bone disease (vit D); neurological features, eg neuropathy.
Tests FBC ( or MCV); Ca2+; Fe; B12 + folate; INR; lipid profi le; coeliac tests (see
‘Coeliac disease’). Stool: Sudan stain for fat globules; stool microscopy (infestation);
elastase. Breath hydrogen analysis: For bacterial overgrowth.20 Take samples of end-
expired air; give glucose; take more samples at ½h intervals; early exhaled hydrogen
= overgrowth. Endoscopy + small bowel biopsy.
Infectious malabsorption Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Isospora belli, Cyclospora
cayetanensis, microsporidia. Tropical sprue: Villous atrophy + malabsorption occur-
ring in the Far and Middle East and Caribbean—the cause is unknown. Tetracycline
250mg/6h PO + folic acid 5mg/d PO for 3–6mnths may help.
Coeliac disease
Suspect this if diarrhoea + weight loss or anaemia (esp. if iron or B12 ). T-cell-
responses to gluten (alcohol-soluble proteins in wheat, barley, rye ± oats) in the small
bowel causes villous atrophy and malabsorption. Associations HLA DQ2 in 95%; the
rest are DQ8; autoimmune disease; dermatitis herpetiformis. Prevalence 1 in 100–300
(commoner if Irish). Any age (peaks in childhood and 50–60yrs). : >1:1. Relative
risk in 1st-degree relatives is 6≈.
Presentation Stinking stools/steatorrhoea; diarrhoea; abdominal pain; bloating; nau-
sea + vomiting; aphthous ulcers; angular stomatitis (p327, fi g 8.5); weight; fatigue;
weakness; osteomalacia; failure to thrive (children). ~30% less severe: may mimic IBS.
Diagnosis Hb; RCDW (p325); B12, ferritin. Antibodies: anti-transglutaminase is
single preferred test (but is an IgA antib ody—check IgA levels to exclude subclass defi -
ciency). Where serology positive or high index of suspicion proceed to duodenal biopsy
while on a gluten-containing diet: expect subtotal villous atrophy, intra-epithelial WBCS
+ crypt hyperplasia. Where doubt persists, HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genotyping may help.
Treatment Lifelong gluten-free diet—patients become experts. Rice, maize, soya,
potatoes, and sugar are OK. Limited consumption of oats (≤50g/d) may be toler-
ated in patients with mild disease. Gluten-free biscuits, fl our, bread, and pasta are
prescribable. Monitor response by symptoms and repeat serology.9
Complications Anaemia; dermatitis herpetiformis (OHCS p588); osteopenia/os-
teoporosis; hyposplenism (off er ‘fl u and pneumococcal vaccinations); GI T-cell
lymphoma (rare; suspect if refractory symptoms or weight);  risk of malignancy
(lymphoma, gastric, oesophageal, colorectal); neuropathies.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
IBS denotes a mixed group of abdominal symptoms for which no organic cause can
be found. Most are probably due to disorders of intestinal motility, enhanced visceral
perception (the ‘brain–gut’ axis: see BOX ‘Managing IBS’), or microbial dysbiosis. Sev-
eral diagnostic criteria exist (see BOX ‘Defi ning gastrointestinal dysfunction’ p261).
Prevalence 10–20%; age at onset: 40yrs; : ≥2:1.
Diagnosis Only diagnose IBS if recurrent abdominal pain (or discomfort) associated
with at least 2 of: • relief by defecation • altered stool form • altered bowel frequen-
cy (constipation and diarrhoea may alternate). Other features: urgency; incomplete
evacuation; abdominal bloating/distension; mucus PR; worsening of symptoms after
food. Symptoms are chronic (>6 months), and often exacerbated by stress, men-
struation, or gastroenteritis (post-infectious IBS). Signs: Examination may be nor-
mal, but general abdominal tenderness is common. Insuffl ation of air during lower
GI endoscopy (not usually needed) may reproduce the pain. Think of other diagnoses
if: Age >60yrs; history <6 months; anorexia; weight; waking at night with pain/diar-
rhoea; mouth ulcers; abnormal CRP, ESR.

Causes of gastrointestinal malabsorption
Common in the UK: Coeliac disease; chronic pancreatitis; Crohn’s disease.
Rarer:
• Bile: primary biliary cholangitis; ileal resection; biliary obstruction; colestyramine.
• Pancreatic insuffi ciency: pancreatic cancer; cystic fi brosis.
• Small bowel mucosa: Whipple’s disease (p716); radiation enteritis; tropical
sprue; small bowel resection; brush border enzyme defi ciencies (eg lactase
insuffi ciency); drugs (metformin, neomycin, alcohol); amyloid (p370).
• Bacterial overgrowth:20 spontaneous (esp. in elderly); in jejunal diverticula; post-
op blind loops. DM & PPI use are also risk factors. Try metronidazole 400mg/8h PO.
Don’t confuse with aff erent loop syndrome (p622).
• Infection: giardiasis; diphyllobothriasis (B12 malabsorption); strongyloidiasis.
• Intestinal hurry: post-gastrectomy dumping; post-vagotomy; gastroj ejunostomy.
Managing IBS
Make a positive diagnosis (p266) and other diagnoses, so:
• If the history is classic, FBC, ESR, CRP & coeliac serology (p266) are suffi cient.
• If 60yrs or any marker or organic disease (T°, blood PR, weight): colonoscopy.
• Have a low threshold for referring if family history of ovarian or bowel cancer.
• : excluding ovarian cancer requires serum CA-125 (OHCS p281); endo m etriosis
(OHCS p288) often mimics IBS: consider if pain cyclical.
• If IBS criteria not met, consider clinical context and decide upon: stool culture;
B12/folate; TSH; faecal calprotectin (p262).
Refer if: 1 Diagnostic uncertainty (you or the patient!). 2 If changing symptoms
in ‘known IBS’. 3 Refractory to management: stress or depression (seen in ≥50%)
or refractory symptoms (here, NICE favours cognitive therapy, OHCS p390), chronic
pain overlap syndromes (fi bromyalgia + chronic fatigue + chronic pelvic pain) or
detrusor problems.
Treatment: Should focus on controlling symptoms, initially using lifestyle/dietary
measures, then cognitive therapy (OHCS p390) or pharmacotherapy if required:
• Constipation: ensure adequate water and fi bre intake and promote physical
activity; (fi bre intake can worsen fl atule nce/bloating so avoid insoluble fi bre,
such as bran; oats are better). Simple laxatives (p260, but beware lactulose
which ferments and can aggravate bloating). If 2 of these fail, try prucalopride,
linaclotide, or lubiprostone; or self-administered anal irrigation.
• Diarrhoea: avoid sorbitol sweeteners, alcohol, and caff eine; reduce dietary
fi bre content; encourage patients to identify their own ‘trigger’ foods; try a
bulking agent ± loperamide 2mg after each loose stool.
• Colic/bloating: oral antispasmodics: mebeverine 135mg/8h or hyoscine butyl-
bromide 10mg/8h (over the counter). Combination probiotics in suffi cient doses
(eg VSL#3®) may help fl atulence or bloating. Diets low in fermentable, poorly
absorbed saccharides and alcohols may provide benefi t (the low FODMAP diet).
• Psychological symptoms/visceral hypersensitivity: emphasize the positive!
You have excluded sinister pathology and over time, symptoms tend to improve.
Consider cognitive behavioural therapy (OHCS p390), hypnosis, and tricyclics, eg
amitriptyline 10–20mg at night (SE: drowsiness, dry mouth); explain that this is at
a low dose for visceral pain (ie you are not prescribing the higher licensed dose
for depression).
20 Bacterial overgrowth proximal to the colon causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vitamin malabsorp-
tion. Causes: old age, autonomic neuropathy (eg diabetic), ileocaecal valve resection; PPI usage; amyloidosis.

Nutritional disorders
Always consider that more than one nutritional disorder is likely to be present
(table 6.9).
Scurvy is due to lack of vitamin C.21 Is the patient poor, pregnant, or on an odd
diet? Signs: 1 Listlessness, anorexia, cachexia (p35). 2 Gingivitis, loose teeth, and foul
breath (halitosis). 3 Bleeding from gums, nose, hair follicles, or into joints, bladder,
gut. 4 Muscle pain/weakness. 5 Oedema. Diagnosis: No test is completely satisfac-
tory. WBC ascorbic acid.  : Dietary education; ascorbic acid ≥250mg/24h PO.
Beriberi There is heart failure with general oedema (wet beriberi) or neuropathy
(dry beriberi) due to lack of vitamin B1 (thiamine). For treatment and diagnostic
tests, see Wernicke’s encephalopathy (p714).
Pellagra = lack of nicotinic acid. Classical triad: diarrhoea, dementia, dermatitis
(Casal’s necklace) ± neuropathy, depression, insomnia, tremor, rigidity, ataxia, fi ts.
It may occur in carcinoid syndrome and anti-TB drugs (isoniazid). It is endemic in
China and Africa. : Education, electrolyte replacement, nicotinamide 100mg/4h.
Xerophthalmia This vitamin A defi ciency syndrome is a big cause of blindness in the
Tropics. Conjunctivae become dry and develop oval/triangular spots (Bitôt’s spots).
Corneas become cloudy and soft. Give vitamin A (OHCS p460). Get special help if
pregnant: vitamin A embryopathy must be avoided. Re-educate and monitor diet.

21 That oranges and lemons prevent ‘the scurvy’ was noted by the naval surgeon James Lind in 1753. In
what may rank as the fi rst ever clinical trial, he randomly divided 12 sailors with scurvy into 6 groups,
given the same basic diet but each group received a unique dietary intervention. The 2 sailors receving
oranges and lemons both made a good recovery, unlike the other 10.

Food mountains, the pellagra paradox, and the sorrow that weeping
cannot symbolize
‘The sweet smell is a great sorrow on the land. Men who can graft the trees and
make the seed fertile and big can fi nd no way to let the hungry people eat their
produce … The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed
to keep up the price …
There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here
that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our suc-
cess. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe
fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profi t cannot be taken
from an orange. And coroners must fi ll in the certifi cates—died of malnutri-
tion—because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.
The people come with nets to fi sh for potatoes in the river, and the guards
hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the
kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes fl oat by, listen
to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch
the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the
people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath.
In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are fi lling and growing heavy,
growing heavy for the vintage.’ (J Steinbeck The Grapes of Wrath)
How do John Steinbeck’s grapes grow in our 21st-century soil? Too well; a
double harvest, it turns out, as not only is much of the world starving, amid
plenty (for those who can pay) but also there is a new ‘sorrow in our land that
weeping cannot symbolize’: pathological ‘voluntary’ self-starvation, again amid
plenty, in pursuit of the body-beautiful according to images laid down by media
gods. If gastroenterologists had one wish it might not be the end ing of all their
diseases, but that humankind stand in a right relationship with Steinb eck’s fer-
tile earth, his straight trees, his sturdy trunks, and his ripe fruit.

Chronic pancreatitis
Epigastric pain ‘bores’ through to the back, eg relieved by sitting forward or hot water
bottles on epigastrium/back (look for erythema ab igne’s mottled dusky greyness);
bloating; steatorrhoea; weight; brittle diabetes. Symptoms relapse and worsen.
Causes Alcohol; smoking; autoimmune; rarely: familial; cystic fi brosis; haemochro-
matosis; pancreatic duct obstruction (stones/tumour); congenital (pancreas divisum).
Tests Ultrasound ± CT: pancreatic calcifi cations confi rm the diagnosis, MRCP; AXR.
Speckled calcifi cation; faecal elastase.
Treatment Drugs: Give analgesia (coeliac-plexus block may give brief relief); lipase,
eg Creon®; fat-soluble vitamins. Insulin needs may be high or variable (beware hy-
poglycaemia). Diet: No alcohol; low fat may help. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT
oil) may be tried (no lipase needed for absorpt ion, but diarrhoea may be worsened).
Surgery: For unremitting pain; narcotic abuse (beware of this); weight: eg pancrea-
tectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy (a duct drainage procedure).
Complications Pseudocyst; diabetes; biliary obstruction; local arterial aneurysm;
splenic vein thrombosis; gastric varices; pancreatic carcinoma.
Carcinoma of the pancreas
Epidemiology ≈3% of all malignancy; ~9000 deaths/yr (UK). UK incidence is rising.
Typical patient  >70yrs old. Risk factors Smoking, alcohol, carcinogens, DM,
chronic pancreatitis, waist circumference (ie adiposity), and possibly a high-fat and
red or processed meat diet. Pathology Mostly ductal adenocarcinoma (meta stasize
early; present late). 60% arise in the pancreas head, 25% in the body, 15% tail. A few
arise in the ampulla of Vater (ampullary tumour) or pancreatic islet cells (insulinoma,
gastrinoma, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas (p223), VIPomas); both have a better
prognosis. Genetics ~95% have mutations in the KRAS2 gene.
The patient Tumours in the head of the pancreas present with painless obstruc-
tive jaundice. 75% of tumours in the body and tail present with epigastric pain (ra-
diates to back and relieved by sitting forward). Either may cause anorexia, weight
loss, diabetes, or acute pancreatitis. Rarer features: Thrombophlebitis migrans (eg
an arm vein becomes swollen and red, then a leg vein); Ca2+; marantic endocardi-
tis; portal hypertension (splenic vein thrombosis); nephrosis (renal vein metasta-
ses). Signs: Jaundice + palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier’s ‘law’, p272); epigastric
mass; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly; lymphadenopathy; ascites.
Tests Blood: Cholestatic jaundice. CA 19–9 (p531) is non-specifi c, but helps assess
prognosis. Imaging: US or CT can show a pancreatic mass ± dilated biliary tree ±
hepatic metastases. They can guide biopsy and help staging prior to surgery/stent
insertion. ERCP/MRCP (p742) show biliary tree anatomy and may localize the site of
obstruction. EUS (endoscopic sonography) is an emerging adjunct for diagnosis and
staging. : Most ductal cancers present with metastatic disease; <20% are suitable
for radical surgery. Surgery: Resection (pancreato duodenectomy: Whip p le’s, p271,
fi g 6.23) is a major undertaking best considered only where no distant metastases
and where vascular invasion is still at a minimum. Post-op morbidity is high (mortal-
ity <5%); non-curative resection confers no survival benefi t. Laparoscopic excision:
Tail lesions are easiest. Post-op chemotherapy: Delays disease progression. Pal-
liation of jaundice: Endoscopic or percutaneous stent insertion may help jaundice
and anorexia. Rarely, palliative bypass surgery is done for duodenal obstruction or
unsuccessful ERCP. Pain: Disabling pain may need big doses of opiates (p575), or radi-
otherapy. Coeliac plexus infi ltration with alcohol may be done at the time of surgery,
or percutaneously. Referral to a palliative care team is essential.
Prognosis Often dismal. Mean survival <6 months. 5yr survival: 3%. Overall 5yr sur-
vival after Whipple’s procedure 5–14%. Prognosis is better if: tumour <3cm; no nodes
involved; Ωve resection margins at surgery; ampullary or islet cell tumours.

Carcinoid tumours
This is a specialized area! A diverse group of tumours of enterochromaffi n cell (neu-
ral crest) origin, by defi nition capable of producing 5HT. Common sites: appendix
(45%), ileum (30%), or rectum (20%).22 They also occur elsewhere in the GI tract,
ovary, testis, and bronchi. 80% of tumours >2cm across will metastasize (ie consider
all as malignant). Symptoms and signs Initially few. GI tumours can cause ap-
pendicitis, intussusception, or obstruction. Hepatic metastases may cause RUQ pain.
Tumours may secrete bradykinin, tachykinin, substance P, VIP, gastrin, insulin, gluca-
gon, ACTH ( Cushing’s syndrome), parathyroid, and thyroid hormones. 10% are part
of MEN-1 syndrome (p223); 10% occur with other neuroendocrine tumours.
Carcinoid syndrome Occurs in ~5% and implies hepatic involvement.
Symptoms and signs: Bronchoconstriction; paroxysmal fl ushing especially in upper
body (± migrating weals); diarrhoea; CCF (tricuspid incompetence and pulmonary
stenosis from 5HT–induced fi brosis). Carcinoid crisis: See BOX ‘Carcinoid crisis’.
Tests 24h urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA, a 5HT metabolite; levels change
with drugs and diet: discuss with lab). CXR + chest/pelvis MRI/CT help locate primary
tumours. Plasma chromogranin A (refl ects tumour mass); 111Indium octreotide scin-
tigraphy (octreoscan) and positron emission tomography (p739) also have a role.
Echocardiography and BNP (p137) can be used to investigate carcinoid heart disease.
Treatment Carcinoid syndrome: Octreotide (somatostatin analogue) blocks
release of tumour mediators and counters peripheral eff ects. Long-acting
alternative: lanreotide. Loperamide for diarrhoea. Tumour therapy: Resection is
the only cure for carcinoid tumours so it is vital to fi nd the primary site. At surgery,
tumours are an intense yellow. Procedures depend on site, eg rectal carcinoid
tumours <1cm can be resected endoscopically. Debulking (eg enucleating),
embolization, or radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastases can  symptoms.
Give octreotide cover to avoid precipitating a massive carcinoid crisis.
Median survival 5–8yrs (~3yrs if metastases are present, but may be up to 20yrs;
so beware of giving up too easily, even in metastatic disease).
Carcinoid crisis
When a tumour outgrows its blood supply or is handled too much during sur-
gery, mediators fl ood out. There is life-threatening vasodilation, hypotension,
tachycardia, bronchoconstriction, and hyperglycaemia. It is treated with high-
dose octreotide, supportive measures, and careful management of fl uid balance
(ie a central line is needed—see p775 for insertion technique).
Whipple’s procedure
(a) Areas of refl ection of diff erent parts (b) Post-operation
Fig 6.23 Whipple’s procedure may be used for removing masses in the head of the pancreas—
typically from pancreatic carcinoma or, rarely, a carcinoid tumour.1 0
22 Some are never clinically detected: 1 in 300 autopsies have a small bowel carcinoid tumour.

Jaundice
Jaundice refers to yellowing of skin, sclerae, and mucosae from plasma bilirubin
(visible at 60μmol/L fi g 6.24). Jaundice is classifi ed by the site of the problem (pre-
hepatic, hepatocellular, or cholestatic/obs tructive) or by the type of circulating bili-
rubin (conjugated or unconj ugated, fi g 6.25).
Unconjugated hyperbilir ubinaemia As unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble,
it does not enter urine, resulting in unconjugated hyperbilir ubinaemia.
Overproduction: Haemolysis (p338, eg malaria/DIC, etc); ineff ective erythropoiesis.
Impaired hepatic uptake: Drugs (paracetamol, rifampicin), ischaemic hepatitis.
Impaired conjugation: Eponymous syndromes: Gilbert’s, p700; Crigler–Najjar, p696.
Physiological neonatal jaundice: Caused by a combination of the above, OHCS p115.
Conjugated hyperbili rubinaemia As conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble, it is
excreted in urine, making it dark. Less conjugated bilirubin enters the gut and the
faeces become pale. When severe, it can be associated with an intractable pruri-
tus which is best treated by relief of the obstruction.
Hepatocellular dysfunction: There is hepatocyte damage, usually with some chole-
stasis. Causes: Viruses: hepatitis (p278), CMV (p405), EBV (p405); drugs (see ta-
ble 6.10); alcohol; cirrhosis (see BOX ‘Causes of jaundice’); liver metastases/abscess;
haemo chromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); septicaemia; leptospirosis; syphilis;
1-anti trypsin defi ciency (p290); Budd–Chiari (p696); Wilson’s disease (p285); failure
to excrete conjugated bilirubin (Dubin–Johnson & Rotor syndromes, p698, p710);
right heart failure; toxins, eg carbon tetrachloride; fungi (fi g 6.26).
Impaired hepatic excretion (cholestasis): Primary biliary cholangitis; primary
sclerosing cholangitis; drugs (see table 6.10); common bile duct gallstones; pan-
creatic cancer; compression of the bile duct, eg lymph nodes at the porta hepatis;
cholangiocarcinoma; choledochal cyst; Caroli’s disease;23 Mirrizi’s syndrome (ob-
structive jaundice from common bile duct compression by a gallstone impacted in
the cystic duct, often associated with cholangitis).
The patient Ask: About blood transfusions, IV drug use, body piercing, tattoos,
sexual activity, travel abroad, jaundiced contacts, family history, alcohol use, and all
medications (eg old drug charts; GP records). Examine: For signs of chronic liver dis-
ease (p276), hepatic encephalopathy (p275), lymph adenopathy, hepatomegaly, spleno-
megaly, ascites, and a palpable gallbladder (if seen with painless jaundice the cause
is not gallstones—Courvoisier’s ‘law’).24 Pale stools + dark urine ≈ cholestatic jaundice.
Tests See p276 for screening tests in suspected liver disease. Urine: Bilirubin is
absent in pre-hepatic causes; in obstructive jaundice, urobilinogen is absent. Hae-
matology: FBC, clotting, fi lm, reticulocyte count, Coombs’ test and haptoglobins
for haemolysis (p336), malaria parasites (eg if unconjugated bilirubin/fever); Paul
Bunnell (EBV). Chemistry: U&E, LFT, -GT, total protein, albumin.25 Paracetamol lev-
els. Microbiology: Blood and other cultures; hepatitis serology. Ultrasound: Are
the bile ducts dilated? Are there gallstones, hepatic metastases, or a pancreatic
mass? ERCP: (See p742.) If bile ducts are dilated and LFT not improving. MRCP: (See
p742.) Or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if conventional ultrasound shows gallstones
but no defi nite com mon bile duct stones. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) If bile ducts
are normal. Consider abdominal CT/MRI if abdominal malignancy is suspected.
What to do? Treat the cause promptly. Ensure adequate hydration; broad-spec-
trum antibiotics if obstruction. Monitor for ascites, encephalopathy; call a hepatologist.
23 Multiple segmental cystic or saccular dilatations of intrahepatic bile ducts with congenital hepatic
fi brosis. It may present in 20yr-olds, with portal hypertension ± recurrent cholangitis/cholelithiasis.
24 Pancreatic or gallbladder cancer is more likely, as stones lead to a fi brotic, unexpandable gallbladder.
25 Albumin & INR are the best indicators of hepatic synthetic function. Transaminases (ALT, AST) indi-
cate hepatocyte damage. ALP suggests obstructive jaundice, but also occurs in hepatocellular jaundice,
malignant infi ltration, pregnancy (placental isoenzyme), Paget’s disease, and childhood (bone isoenzyme).

The pathway of bilirubin metabolism
In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by hepatocytes, making
it water-soluble. Conjugated bilirubin is secreted in bile and passes into the gut.
Some is taken up again by the liver (via the enterohepatic circulation) and the rest
is converted to urobilinogen by gut bacteria. Urobilinogen is either reabsorbed and
excreted by the kidneys, or converted to stercobilin, which colours faeces brown.
Fig 6.25 Bilirubin is formed by the
breakdown of haemoglobin in a
3-step process: hepatic uptake, con-
jugation, and excretion.
Causes of jaundice in a previously stable patient with cirrhosis
• Sepsis (esp. UTI, pneumonia, or peritonitis) • Alcohol; drugs (table 6.10)
• Malignancy: eg hepatocellular carcinoma • GI bleeding.
Signs of decompensation: Jaundice; ascites; UGI bleed; encephalopathy.
Table 6.10 Examples of drug-induced jaundice
Haemolysis • Antimalarials (eg dapsone)
Hepatitis • Paracetamol overdose (p844) • Sodium valproate
• Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide • Halothane
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors • Statins
• Flucloxacillin (may be weeks after ) • Sulfonylureas
Cholestasis • Fusidic acid, co-amoxiclav, nitrofurantoin • Prochlorperazine
• Steroids (anabolic; the Pill) • Chlorpromazine
Fig 6.26 Amanita phalloides (Latin for ‘phallic toadstool’;
also known as the ‘death cap’) is a lethal cause of jaundice. It
is the most toxic mushroom known. After ing estion (its benign
appearance is confusing), amat oxins induce hepatic necros is
leaving few options other than transplantation.

Liver failure
Defi nitions Liver failure may be recognized by the development of coagulopathy
(INR>1.5) and encephalopathy. This may occur suddenly in the previously healthy liver
= acute liver failure (hyperacute = onset ≤ 7d; acute = 8–21d; subacute = 4–26wks.)
More often it occurs on a background of cirrhosis = chronic liver failure. Fulminant
hepatic failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from massive necrosis of liver cells
leading to severe impairment of liver function.
Causes Infections: Viral hepatitis (esp. B, C, CMV), yellow fever, leptospirosis. Drugs:
Paracetamol overdose, halothane, isoniazid. Toxins: Amanita phalloides mushroom
(fi g 6.26), carbon tetrachloride. Vascular: Budd–Chiari syn. (p696), veno-occlusive
disease. Others: Alcohol, fatty liver disease, primary biliary cholangitis, primary
sclerosing cholangitis, haemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, 1-antitrypsin de-
fi ciency, Wilson’s disease, fatty liver of pregnancy (OHCS p25), malignancy.
Signs Jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy (see BOX ‘Hepatic encephalopathy’), fetor
hepaticus (smells like pear drops), asterixis/fl ap (p50), constructional apraxia (can-
not copy a 5-pointed star?). Signs of chronic liver disease (p276) suggest acute-on-
chronic hepatic failure.
Tests Blood: FBC (?infection,26 ?GI bleed), U&E,27 LFT, clotting (PT/INR), glucose, para-
cetamol level, hepatitis, CMV and EBV serology, ferritin, 1-antitrypsin, caeruloplasmin,
autoantibodies (p284). Microbiology: Blood culture; urine culture; ascitic tap for
MC&S of ascites—neutrophils >250/mm3 indicates spontaneous bact erial peritonitis
(p276). Radiology: CXR; abdominal ultrasound; Doppler fl ow studies of the portal vein
(and hepatic vein in suspected Budd–Chiari syndrome, p696). Neuro physiology: EEG,
evoked potentials (and neuroimaging) have a limited role.
Management Beware sepsis, hypoglycaemia, GI bleeds/varices, & encephalopathy:
• Nurse with a 20° head-up tilt in ITU. Protect the airway with intubation and in-
sert an NG tube to avoid aspiration and remove any blood from stomach.
• Insert urinary and central venous catheters to help assess fl uid status.
• Monitor T°, respirations, pulse, BP, pupils, urine output hourly. Daily weights.
• Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and INR daily.
• 10% glucose IV, 1L/12h to avoid hypoglycaemia. Do blood glucose every 1–4h.
• Treat the cause, if known (eg GI bleeds, sepsis, paracetamol poisoning, p844).
• If malnourished, get dietary help: good nutrition can decrease mortality. Give
thiamine and folate supplements (p714).
• Treat seizures with phenytoin (p826).1 1
• Haemofi ltration or haemodialysis, if renal failure develops (BOX ‘What is hepato-
renal syndrome?’).
• Try to avoid sedatives and other drugs with hepatic metabolism (BOX ‘Prescrib-
ing in liver failure’ and BNF).
• Consider PPI as prophylaxis against stress ulceration, eg omeprazole 40mg/d IV/PO.
• Liaise early with nearest transplant centre regarding appropriateness.
Treat complications Cerebral oedema: On ITU: 20% mannitol IV; hyperventilate.
Ascites: Restrict fl uid, low-salt diet, weigh daily, diuretics (p276).
Bleeding: Vitamin K 10mg/d IV for 3d, platelets, FFP + blood as needed ± endoscopy.
Blind  of infection: Ceftriaxone 1–2g/24h IV, not gentamicin (risk of renal failure).
Blood glucose: If 2mmol/L or symptomatic,  50mL of 50% glucose IV; check often.
Encephalopathy: Avoid sedatives; 20° head-up tilt in ITU; correct electrolytes;
lactulose 30–50mL/8h (aim for 2–4 soft stools/d) is catabolized by bacterial fl ora
to short-chain fatty acids which colonic pH and trap NH
3
in the colon as NH 4+ ;
Rifaximin 550mg/12h is a non-absorbable oral antibiotic that  numbers of nitrogen-
forming gut bacteria.
Worse prognosis if Grade III–IV encephalopathy, age >40yrs, albumin <30g/L, INR,
drug-induced liver failure, late-onset hepatic failure worse than fulminant failure.
26 Neutrophilic leucocytosis need not mean a secondary infection: alcoholic hepatitis may be the cause.
27 Urea is synthesized in the liver, so is a poor test of renal function in liver failure; use creatinine instead.

Prescribing in liver failure
Avoid drugs that constipate (risk of encephalopathy), oral hypoglycaemics, and
saline-containing IVIs. Warfarin eff ects are enhanced. Hepatotoxic drugs include
paracetamol, methotrexate, isoniazid, azathioprine, phenothiazines, oestrogen,
6-mercaptopurine, salicylates, tetracycline, mitomycin.
Hepatic encephalopathy: letting loose some false neurotransmitters
As the liver fails, nitrogenous waste (as ammonia) builds up in the circulation
and passes to the brain, where astrocytes clear it (by processes involving the
conversion of glutamate to glutamine). This excess glutamine causes an osmotic
imbalance and a shift of fl uid into these cells—hence cerebral oedema. Grading:
I Altered mood/behaviour; sleep disturbance (eg reversed sleep pattern); dysp-
raxia (‘Please copy this 5-pointed star’); poor arithmetic. No liver fl ap.
II Increasing drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech ± liver fl ap, inappropriate
behaviour/personality change (ask the family—don’t be too tactful).
III Incoherent; restless; liver fl ap; stupor.
IV Coma.
What else could be clouding consciousness? Hypoglycaemia; sepsis; trauma; postictal.
What is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)?
Cirrhosis + ascites + renal failure ≈ HRS—if other causes of renal impairment
have been excluded. Abnormal haemodynamics causes splanchnic and systemic
vaso dilation, but renal vasoconstriction. Bacterial translocation, cytokines, and
mesenteric angiogenesis cause splanchnic vasodilation, and altered renal auto-
regulation is involved in the renal vasoconstriction.
Types of HRS: HRS 1 is a rapidly progressive deterioration in circulatory and renal
function (median survival <2wks), often triggered by other deteriorating patholo-
gies. Terlipressin resists hypovolaemia. Haemodialysis may be needed. HRS 2 is a
more steady deterioration (survival ~6 months). Transjugular intrahepatic porto-
systemic stent shunting may be required (TIPS, p257).
Other factors in cirrhosis may contribute to poor renal function (p277).
Transplants: Liver transplant may be required. After >8–12wks of pre-transplant
dialysis, some may be considered for combined liver–kidney transplantation.
King’s College Hospital criteria in acute liver failure
Paracetamol-induced liver failure Non-paracetamol liver failure
• Arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion. • PT >100s.
Or all of the following: Or 3 out of 5 of the following:
• Prothrombin time (PT) >100s 1 Drug-induced liver failure
• Creatinine >300μmol/L 2 Age< 10 or >40yrs old
• Grade III or IV encephalopathy. 3 >1wk from 1st jaundice to
encephalopathy
4 PT >50s
5 Bilirubin≥ 300μmol/L.
Fulfi lling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure and should
prompt consideration for transplantation (p277).

Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis (Greek kirrhos = yellow) implies irreversible liver damage. Histologically, there
is loss of normal hepatic architecture with bridging fi brosis and nodular regeneration.
Causes Most often chronic alcohol abuse, HBV, or HCV infection. Others: see BOX
‘Causes of cirrhosis’.
Signs Leuconychia: white nails with lunulae undemarcated, from hypo-
albuminaemia; Terry’s nails—white proximally but distal ⅓ reddened by telangi-
ectasias; clubbing; palmar erythema; hyperdynamic cir culation; Dupuytren’s
contracture; spider naevi (fi g 6.27); xanthelasma; gynaecomastia; atrophic testes;
loss of body hair; parotid enlargement (alcohol); hepatomegaly, or small liver in
late disease; ascites; splenomegaly.
Complications Hepatic failure: Coagulopathy (failure of hepatic synthesis of
clotting factors); encephalopathy (p259); hypoalbuminaemia (oedema); sepsis
(pneumonia; septicaemia); spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP); hypoglycaemia.
Portal hypertension: Ascites (fi g 6.28); splenomeg aly; portosystemic shunt includ-
ing oesophageal varices (± life-threatening upper GI bleed) and caput medusae
(enlarged superfi cial periumbilical veins). HCC:  risk.
Tests Blood: LFT:  or bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, GT. Later, with loss of synthetic
function, look for albumin ± PT/INR. WCC & platel ets indicate hypersplenism.
Find the cause: ferritin, iron/total iron-binding capacity (p288); hepatitis serol-
ogy (p278); immunoglobulins (p290); autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, SMA, p553); -feto
protein (p286); caeruloplasmin in patients <40yrs old (p285); 1-antitrypsin (p290).
Liver ultrasound + duplex: May show a small liver or hepatomegaly, splenomegaly,
focal liver lesion(s), hepatic vein thrombus, reversed fl ow in the portal vein, or as-
cites. MRI: Caudate lobe size, smaller islands of regenerating nodules, and the pres-
ence of the right posterior hepatic notch are more frequent in alcoholic cirrhosis
than in virus-induced cirrhosis. Ascitic tap: Should be performed and fl uid sent for
urgent MC&S—neutrophils >250/mm3 indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (see
later in topic for treatment). Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Confi rms the clinical diagnosis.
Management General: Good nutrition is vital. Alcohol abstinence (p280). Avoid
NSAIDS, sedatives, and opiates. Colestyramine helps pruritus (4g/12h PO, 1h after
other drugs). Consider ultrasound ± -fetoprotein every 6 months to screen for
HCC (p286) in those where this information will change management. Specifi c: For
hepatitis-induced cirrhosis see p278. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in PBC (p282)
may improve LFT and improve transplant-free survival. Penicillamine for Wilson’s
disease (p285). Ascites: Fluid restriction (<1.5L/d), low-salt diet (40–100mmol/d).
Give spironolactone 100mg/24h PO; dose as tolerated (max 400mg/24h)—it coun-
ters deranged renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) axis. Chart daily weight and aim
for weight loss of ≤½kg/d. If response is poor, add furosemide ≤120mg/24h PO; do
U&E (watch Na+) often. Therapeutic paracentesis with concomitant albumin infusion
(6–8g/L fl uid removed) may be required. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP):
Must be considered in any patient with ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may
be asymptomatic). Common organisms are E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci. : eg
piperacillin with tazobactam 4.5g/8h for 5d or until sensitivities known. Give prophy-
laxis for high-risk patients (albumin, PT/INR, low ascitic albumin) or those who have
had a previous episode: eg ciprofl oxacin 500mg PO daily. Encephalopathy: Recurrent
episodes may be reduced in frequency with prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin
(p274). Renal failure: hepatic clearance of immune complexes leads to trapping in
kidneys ( IgA nephropathy ± hepatic glomerulosclerosis). See also p275 for hepato-
renal syndrome.
Prognosis Overall 5yr survival is ~50%. Poor prognostic indicators: encephalopa-
thy; serum Na+ <110mmol/L; serum albumin <25g/L; INR.
Liver transplantation is the only defi nitive treatment for cirrhosis (p277). Acute
indications: Acute liver failure meeting King’s College criteria (see BOX ‘King’s Col-
lege Hospital criteria in acute liver failure’ p275) Chronic indications: Advanced cir-
rhosis of any cause; hepatocellular cancer (1 nodule <5cm or ≤5 nodules <3cm).

Causes of cirrhosis
• Chronic alcohol use • Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
• Chronic HBV or HCV infection28 • Autoimmunity: primary biliary cholangi-
• Genetic disorders: haemochromatosis tis (p282); primary sclerosing cholangitis
(p288); 1-antitrypsin defi ciency (p290); (p282); autoimmune hepatitis (p284)
Wilson’s disease (p285) • Drugs: eg amiodarone, methyldopa,
• Hepatic vein events (Budd–Chiari, p696) methotrexate.
Is cirrhosis becoming decompensated? Prepare to make an arrest...
Cirrhosis may lie in wait for years before committing one of its three great crimes
against the person: jaundice, ascites, or encephalopathy. There are almost always
accomplices who, if arrested now, may stop a killing from unfolding. These usual
suspects are: dehydration constipation covert alcohol use infection (eg spon-
taneous peritonitis, see earlier in topic) opiate over-use—or an occult GI bleed. If
all have alibis, think of portal vein thrombosis, and call in the Chief Inspector.
Liver transplantation
The fi rst liver transplant was in Denver, USA, in 1963. Now 800–1000 are performed
each year in the UK (indications see p284). The limiting step for the procedure is
often the waiting-list for a donor organ, which may be cadaveric (heart-beating or
non-heart-beating) or from live donors (right lobe). Contraindications include ex-
trahepatic malignancy; severe cardiorespiratory disease; systemic sepsis; expected
non-compliance with drug therapy; ongoing alcohol consumption (in those with
alcohol-related liver disease). Refer earlier rather than later, eg when ascites is
refractory or after a 1st episode of bacterial peritonitis. Prioritization in the UK is
based upon the UKELD (UK end-stage liver disease) score, calculated from serum Na+,
creatinine, bilirubin, and INR.29
Post-op: 12–48h on ITU, with enteral feeding starting as soon as possible and close
monitoring of LFT. Immunosuppression examples: tacrolimus ± mycophenolate
mofetil (or azat hioprine) + prednisolone. Hypera cute rejection is a result of ABO
incompatibility. Acute rejection (T-cell mediated, at 5–10d): the patient feels unwell
with pyrexia and tender hepatomegaly—often managed by altering the immuno-
suppressives. Other complications: sepsis (esp. Gram Ωve and CMV), hepatic artery
thrombosis, chronic rejection (at 6–9 months), disease recurrence, and, rarely,
graft-versus-host disease. Average patient survival at 1yr is ~80% (5yr survival
60–90%; depends on the pre-op disease).
28 Clues as to which patients with chronic HCV will get cirrhosis: platelet count ≤140 x 109/L, globulin/albu-
min ratio ≥1, and AST/ALT ratio ≥1—100% +ve predictive value but lower sensitivity (~30%).

278 Viral hepatitis
Hepatitis A RNA virus. Spread: Faecal–oral or shellfi sh. Endemic in Africa and S Amer-
ica, so a problem for travellers. Most infections are in childhood. Incubation: 2–6wks.
Sympt oms: Fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, arthralgia—then: jaundice (rare in chil-
dren), hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy. Tests: AST and ALT rise 22–40d after
exposure (ALT may be >1000IU/L), returning to normal over 5–20wks. IgM rises from
day 25 and means recent infection. IgG is detectable for life.
: Supportive. Avoid alcohol. Rarely, interferon alfa for fulminant hepatitis.
Active immunization: With inactivated viral protein. 1 IM dose gives immunity for
1yr (20yrs if further booster is given at 6–12 months).
Prognosis: Usually self-limiting. Fulminant hepatitis is rare. Chronicity doesn’t occur.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV, a DNA virus.) Spread: Blood products, IV drug abusers (IVDU),
sexual, direct contact. Deaths: 1 million/yr. Risk groups: IV drug users and their
sexual partners/carers; health workers; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men;
haemodialysis (and chronic renal failure); sexually promiscuous; foster carers; close
family members of a carrier or case; staff or residents of institutions/prisons; babies
of HBSAg +ve mothers; adopted child from endemic area.
Endemic in: Far East, Africa, Mediterranean. Incubation: 1–6 months.
Signs: Resemble hepatitis A but arthralgia and urticaria are commoner.
Tests: HBSAg (surface antigen) is present 1–6 months after exposure. HBeAg (e an-
tigen) is present for 1½–3 months after acute illness and implies high infectivity.
HBSAg persisting for >6 months defi nes carrier status and occurs in 5–10% of infec-
tions; biopsy may be indicated unless ALT and HBV DNA <2000iu/mL. Antibodies
to HBCAg (anti-HBc) imply past infection; antibodies to HBSAg (anti-HBs) alone imply
vaccination. HBV PCR allows monitoring of response to therapy. See fi g 6.29 and ta-
ble 6.11. Vaccination: See p287. Passive immunization (specifi c anti-HBV immuno-
globulin) may be given to non-immune contacts after high-risk exposure.
Complications: Fulminant hepatic failure, cirrhosis, HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, cryo-
globulinaemia, membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa (p556).
: Avoid alcohol. Immunize sexual contacts. Refer all with chronic liver infl amma-
tion (eg ALT 30IU/L), cirrhosis, or HBV DNA >2000IU/mL for antivirals (choice is 48
wks pegylated (PEG) interferon alfa-2a vs long-term but better tolerated nucleos(t)
ide analogues, eg tenofovir, entecavir). The aim is to clear HBSAg and prevent cir-
rhosis and HCC (risk is  if HBSAg and HBeAg +ve).
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA fl avivirus. Spread: Blood: transfusion, IV drug abuse,
sexual contact. UK prevalence: >200 000. Early infection is often mild/asympto-
matic. ~85% develop silent chronic infection; ~25% get cirrhosis in 20yrs—of these,
4% get hepatocellular cancer (HCC)/yr. Risk factors for progression: Male, older,
higher viral load, use of alcohol, HIV, HBV. Tests: LFT (AST : ALT <1 : 1 until cirrhosis
develops, p276), anti-HCV anti bodies confi rms exposure; HCV-PCR confi rms ongoing
infection/chronicity; liver biopsy or non-invasive elastography if HCV-PCR +ve to as-
sess liver damage and need for treatment. Determine HCV genotype (1–6).
: BOX; quit alcohol. Other complications: Glomerulonephritis; cryoglobulin aemia;
thyroiditis; autoimmune hepatitis; PAN; polymyositis; porphyria cutanea tarda.
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) Incomplete RNA virus (needs HBV for its assembly). HBV vac-
cination prevents HDV infection. 5% of HBV carriers have HDV co-infection. It may
cause acute liver failure/cirrhosis. Tests: Anti-HDV antibody (only ask for it if HBsAg
+ve). : As interferon alfa has limited success, liver transplantation may be needed.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA virus. Similar to HAV; common in Indochina (commoner in
older men and also commoner than hepatitis A in UK); mortal ity is high in pregnancy.
It is associated with pigs. Epidemics occur (eg Africa). Vaccine is available in China
(not Europe). : Serology. : Nil specifi c.
Other infective causes of hepatitis EBV; CMV; leptospirosis; malaria; Q fever; syph-
ilis; yellow fever.

The virologists’ triumph: curing HCV
Since the original isolation of HCV in the late 1980s, riding the wave of the AIDS
scare, less than three decades have elapsed. In this time, the comparatively sim-
ple genome of HCV has proven far easier than HIV to combat and the treatment
of HCV has undergone nothing less than a revolution to the point where many
common genotypes are considered curable.
All patients with sustained detectable HCV should be considered for treatment.
Options are evolving rapidly, but centre on the use of inhibitors of non-structural
viral proteins (eg ledipasvir+sofosbuvir) which are much better tolerated than the
previous mainstay of treatment, pegylated interferon. Interferon-free regimens
therefore eliminate major barriers to compliance including treatment duration and
SES, as well as achieving superior results: contemporary antiviral regimens can now
realistically achieve the complete absence of PCR detectable virus in the blood 6
months post-treatment in almost 100% of genotype 1 patients, including patients
with established cirrhosis. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, can also increasingly
be avoided in genotype 1, though it remains a useful treatment for the harder to
treat genotypes 2 and 3. Here, reported rates of sustained undetectable viral levels
now routinely exceed 90%. The costs of treatment are staggering, but cost-eff ec-
tiveness analysis is favourable given the high cure rates and the signifi cant public
health burden of HCV. Genotypes 4, 5, or 6 are prevalent in lower-income countries
and have received less attention but limited data where resources do exist suggest
similarly good response rates.
Meanwhile, the threat of HIV remains. HCV prevalence is ~7% for sexually trans-
mitted HIV and >90% for IV transmission. Untreated HIV may accelerate progress
of HCV-induced liver fi brosis. All HIV/HCV co-infected patients should be assessed
for combination antiviral therapy. Given the potential for toxicities and viral resist-
ance mutation, such therapies should be planned and delivered through expert
services.

Alcoholism
An alcoholic is one whose problematic pattern of alcohol use leads to clinically sig-
nifi cant impairment or distress, manifested by multiple psychosocial, behavioural,
or physiological features. Other addictions may coexist. Lifetime prevalence: ~10%
( ≈ 4%). Denial is a leading feature, so be sure to question relatives.
Organs aff ected Don’t forget the risk of trauma while intoxicated.
The liver: Normal in 50%;  or GT30—but may be  in any type of liver infl amma-
tion, eg fatty liver, AIH (p284), HBV. Fatty liver: Acute/reversible, but may progress
to cirrhosis if drinking continues (also seen in obesity, DM, and with amiodarone).
Alcoholic hepatitis: See BOX ‘Managing alcoholic hepatitis’. 80% progress to cir-
rhosis (hepatic failure in 10%). Cirrhosis: (See p276.) 5yr survival is 48% if drinking
continues (if not, 77%). Biopsy: Mallory bodies ± neutrophil infi ltrate (can be indis-
tinguishable from NASH, p277).
CNS: Self neglect; memory/cognition: high-potency vitamins IM may reverse it (p714;
don’t delay!); cortical atrophy; retrobulbar neuropathy; fi ts; falls; wide-based gait;
neuropathy; confabulation/Korsakoff ’s (p704) ± Wernicke’s encephalopathy (p714).
Gut: Obesity; D&V; gastric erosions; peptic ulcers; varices (p257); pancreatitis (acute
or chronic); cancer (many types); oesophageal rupture ( vomiting against a closed
glottis; suspect if shock and surgical emphysema in the neck: Boerhaave’s syndrome).
Blood: MCV; anaemia from: marrow depression, GI bleeding, alcoholism-associated
folate defi ciency, haemolysis; sideroblastic anaemia. See p326.
Heart: Arrhythmias; BP; cardiomyopathy; sudden death in binge drinkers.
Reproduction: Testicular atrophy; testosterone/progesterone; oestrogen; fetal al-
cohol syndrome—IQ, short palpebral fi ssure, absent philtrum, and small eyes.
Withdrawal starts 10–72h after last drink. Signs: Pulse; BP; tremor; confusion; fi ts;
hallucinations (delirium treme ns)—may be visual or tactile, eg animals crawling all
over skin. Consider it in any new (3d) ward patient with acute confusion.
Management Alcohol withdrawal: There is almost no role for hospital inpatient
‘detox’ as a sole indication for admission however attractive the idea of a ‘quick fi x’
may be—community-based services are much better placed to support cessation.
Admit only if complicating or coexisting medical problems require inpatient treat-
ment. Check BP + TPR/4h. Beware BP. For the 1st 3d give generous chlordiazepoxide,
eg 10–50mg/6h PO with additional doses PRN, then sum total dose and plan weaning
regimen over 5–7d. Vitamins may be needed (p714). Prevention: (OHCS p512.) Alcohol-
free beers; price may help promote lower-risk drinking. NB: there are no absolutes:
risk is a continuum. Suggest: 1 Graceful ways of declining a drink, eg ‘I’m seeing
what it’s like to go without for a bit’. 2 Not buying him- or herself a drink when it is
his/her turn. 3 ‘Don’t lift your glass to your lips until after the slowest drinker in your
group takes a drink.’ 4 ‘Sip, don’t gulp.’ Give follow-up and encouragement. Treating
established alcoholics: May be rewarding, particularly if they really want to change.
If so, group therapy or self-help (eg Alcoholics Anonymo us) may be useful—espe-
cially if self-initiated and determined. Encourage the will to change.
Relapse 50% will relapse soon after starting treatment. Acamprosate (p449) may
help intense anxiety, insomnia, and craving. CI: pregnancy, severe liver failure,
creatinine >120μmol/L. SE: D&V,  or libido; dose example: 666mg/8h PO if >60kg
and <65yrs old. It should be started as soon as acute withdrawal is complete and
continued for ~1yr. Disulfi ram can be used to treat chronic alcohol dependence. It
causes acetaldehyde build-up (like metronidazole) with extremely unpleasant ef-
fects to any alcohol ingestion—eg fl ushing, throbbing headache, palpitations. Care
must be taken to avoid alcohol (eg toiletries, food, medicines) since severe reac-
tions can occur. Confer with experts if drugs are to be used.
30 GT is  in 52% of alcoholics; it is also  in 50% of those with non-alcoholic fatty livers. Its best use is not
in diagnosing alcoholism but in seeing if a raised ALP is likely to be from liver, not bone.

Screening for unhealthy alcohol use
Several screening tools have been validated (eg AUDIT) but these typically require
detailed questioning and careful scoring. For simplicity, a single-item question has
much to recommend it, such as ‘How many times in the past year have you had fi ve
(four for ) or more drinks in a day?’ (+ve if >0; 82% sensitive, 79% specifi c). This can
be followed up with the easily remembered CAGE questions: Ever felt you ought to
cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
Ever felt guilty about your drinking? Ever had an eye-opener in the morning? Those
answering ‘yes’ to ≥2 may be exhibiting dependency (sensitivity 43–94%; specifi city
70–97%), but accuracy does change according to background population. Those who
refuse, or give unconvincing answers may have more to tell in their biochemistry:
look for GT, ALT, MCV, AST:ALT>2, urea, platelets.
Managing alcoholic hepatitis
The patient: Malaise; TPR; anor exia; D&V; tender hepatomegaly ± jaundice; bleed-
ing; ascites. Blood: WCC; platelets (toxic eff ect or  hypersplenism); INR; AST;
MCV; urea. Jaundice, encephalopathy or coagulopathy ≈ severe hepatitis.
• Most need hospitalizing; urinary catheter and CVP monitoring may be needed.
• Screen for infections ± ascitic fl uid tap and treat for SBP (p276).
• Stop alcohol consumption: for withdrawal symptoms, if chlordiazepoxide by the
oral route is impossible, try lorazepam IM.
• Vitamins: vit K: 10mg/d IV for 3d. Thiamine 100mg/d PO (high-dose B vitamins can
also be given IV as Pabrinex®—1 pair of ampoules in 50mL 0.9% saline IVI over ½h).
• Optimize nutrition (35–40kcal/kg/d non-protein energy). Use ideal body weight
for calculations, eg if malnourished.
• Don’t use low-protein diets even if severe encephalopathy is present. Give >1.2g/
kg/d of protein; this prevents encephalopathy, sepsis, and some deaths.
• Daily weight; LFT; U&E; INR. If creatinine , get help with this—HRS (p275). Na+ is
common, but water restriction may make matters worse.
• Steroids may confer benefi t in those with severe disease. The Maddrey Discrimi-
nant Factor (DF) = (4.6 ≈ patient’s prothrombin time in sec – control time) + bilirubin
(μmol/L) roughly refl ects mortality. If Maddrey score >31 and encephalopathy then
consider prednisolone 40mg/d for 5d tapered over 3wks. CI: sepsis; variceal bleed-
ing. The largest study to date (STOPAH) showed only a non-signifi cant trend towards
benefi t with this regimen.
Prognosis: Mild episodes hardly aff ect mortality; if severe, mortality ≈ 50% at 30d.
1yr after admission for alcoholic hepatitis, 40% are dead...a sobering thought.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)
Interlobular bile ducts are damaged by chronic autoimmune granul omato us31 in-
fl ammation causing cholestasis which may lead to fi brosis, cirrhosis, and portal
hypertension. Cause Unknown environmental triggers (?pollutants, xenobiotics,
non-pathogenic bacteria) + genetic predisposition (eg IL12A locus) leading to loss of
immune tolerance to self-mitochondrial proteins. Antimitochondrial antibodies
(AMA) are the hallmark of PBC. Prevalence 4/100 000. : ≈ 9:1. Risk  if +ve fam-
ily history (seen in 1–6%); many UTIS; smoking; past pregnancy; other auto immune
diseases;  use of nail polish/hair dye. Typical age at presentation ~50yrs.
The patient Often asymptomatic and diagnosed after incidental fi nding ALP. Leth-
argy, sleepiness, and pruritus may precede jaundice by years. Signs: Jaundice; skin
pigmentation; xanthelasma (p691); xantho mata; hepatosplenomegaly. Complica-
tions: Those of cirrhosis (p276); osteoporosis is common. Malabsorption of fat-soluble
vitamins (A, D, E, K) due to cholestasis and bilirubin in the gut lumen results in osteo-
malacia and coagu lopathy; HCC (p286).
Tests Blood: ALP, GT, and mildly AST & ALT; late disease: bilirubin, albumin,
prothrombin time. 98% are AMA M2 subtype +ve, eg in a titre of 1:40 (see earlier in
topic). Other autoantibodies (p553) may occur in low titres. Immunoglobulins are 
(esp. IgM). TSH & cholesterol  or . Ultrasound: Excludes extrahepatic cholestasis.
Biopsy: Not usually needed (unless drug-induced cholestasis or hepatic sarcoidosis
need excluding); look for granulomas around bile ducts ± cirrhosis.31
Treatment Symptomatic: Pruritus: try colestyramine 4–8g/24h PO; naltrexone and
rifampicin may also help. Diarrhoea: codeine phosphate, eg 30mg/8h PO. Osteoporo-
sis prevention: p682. Specifi c: Fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis: vitamin A, D, and K.
Consider high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)Ωit may improve survival and delay
transplantation. SE: weight. Monitoring: Regular LFT; ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly
if cirrhotic. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) For end-stage disease or intractable
pruritus. Histological recurrence in the graft: ~17% after 5yrs; although graft failure
can occur as a result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable.
Prognosis Highly variable. The Mayo survival model is a validated predictor of survival
that combines age, bilirubin, albumin, PT time, oedema, and need for diuretics.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
Progressive cholestasis with bile duct infl ammation and strictures (fi gs 6.30, 6.31).
Symptoms/signs Pruritus ± fatigue; if advanced: ascending cholangitis, cirrh osis, and
hepatic failure. Associations: •  sex. • HLA-A1; B8; DR3. • AIH (p284); >80% of Northern
European patients also have IBD, usually UC; this combination is associated with risk
of colorectal malignancy.
Cancers Bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and colon cancers are more common, so do
yearly colonoscopy + ultrasound; consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps.32
Tests ALP, then bilirubin; hyper gammaglobulin aemia and/or IgM; AMA Ωve, but ANA,
SMA, and ANCA may be +ve; see BOX and p553. ERCP (fi g 6.30) or MRCP (fi g 6.31) reveal
duct anatomy and damage. Liver biopsy shows a fi brous, obliterative cholangitis.
Treatment Liver transplant is the mainstay for end-stage disease; recurrence oc-
curs in up to 30%; 5yr graft survival is >60%. Prognosis is worse for those with
IBD, as 5–10% develop colorectal cancer post-transplant. Ursodeoxycholic acid may
improve LFT but has not shown evidence of survival benefi t. High doses, eg 25–30mg/
kg/d, may be harmful. Colestyra mine 4–8g/24h PO for pruritus (naltrexone and ri-
fampicin may also help). Antibiotics for bacterial cholangitis.
31 Other causes of liver granulomas: TB, sarcoid, infections with HIV (eg toxoplasmosis, CMV, mycobacte-
ria), PAN, SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, syphilis, isoniazid, quinidine, carbamazepine, al-
lopurinol. Signs: PUO; LFT.
32 Usually gallbladder polyps are an incidental fi nding on ultrasound, and they can often be left if <1cm
diameter, but in PSC they are much more likely to become malignant.

Testing for autoantibodies—the anguish of partial understanding
The diagnostic approach to several infl ammatory conditions includes the measure-
ment of autoantibodies. Consequently and all too often, attempts to acquire (and
test) medical knowledge may promote these antibody panels to a position as the
fi nal arbiter of disease diagnosis which, with their varying sensitivities and spe-
cifi cities, they are quite unfi t to assume. Indeed, often just such a work-up shows
strange overlap conditions between apparently diff erent diseases: strange until we
realize that these markers are just surrogates for processes that we lack a complete
aetiological explanation for and in which the antibodies themselves may just be
bystanders. Process that we lack the tools to visualize, as cells of the immune system
continue their onslaught against their perceived enemies, driven by reasons that
none present seem willing to reveal to our crude probing with blood tests, X-rays
and biopsies. While the body knows no diseases, only pain and death, our minds
attempt to impose a unitary disease on unsuspecting and sometimes innocent cells.
For example, clinically we observe that autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) frequently
overlaps with PSC and IBD. A battery of antibody tests may sometimes help
understand the dominant process, but equally may mystify matters still further if
we attempt to apply our inadequate classifi ers (‘But why is the ANCA not positive?’
cries the student, enraged at the failure of the miserable patient’s B lymphocytes
to do the honourable thing). As ever, management should be individualized
dependent on liver and bowel histology, serum immunoglobulin levels, the degree
of biochemical cholestasis, cholangiography, and, yes, autoantibodies.
Fig 6.31 MRCP showing features of PSC. The intrahe-
Fig 6.30 ERCP showing many stric- patic ducts show multifocal strictures. Strictures can
tures in the biliary tree with a charac- be hard to diff erentiate from cholangiocarcinoma
teristic ‘beaded’ appearance. (coexistence of UC may promote this development).
Stenting may be needed.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
An infl ammatory liver disease of unknown cause33 characterized by abnormal T-cell
function and autoantibodies directed against hepatocyte surface antigens. Classifi ca-
tion is by autoantibodies (see table 6.12). AIH predominantly aff ects young or middle-
aged women (bimodal, ie 10–30yrs—or >40yrs old). Up to 40% present with acute
hepatitis and signs of autoimmune disease, eg fever, malaise, urticarial rash, polyar-
thritis, pleurisy, pulmonary infi ltration, or glomerulon ephritis. The remainder present
with gradual jaundice or are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with signs of
chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common and disease tends to attenuate during
pregnancy. Complications Those associated with cirrhosis (p276) and drug therapy.
Tests Serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP all usually , hypergammaglobulinaemia (esp.
IgG), +ve autoantibodies (see table 6.12). Anaemia, WCC, and platelets indicate hy-
persplenism. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Mononuclear infi ltrate of portal and peripor-
tal areas and piecemeal necrosis ± fi brosis; cirrhosis ≈ worse prognosis. MRCP: (See
p742.) Helps exclude PSC if ALP  disproportionately.
Diagnosis Depends on excluding other diseases (no lab test is pathognomonic). Di-
agnostic criteria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in the absence
of viral disease are helpful. Sometimes diagnosis is a challenge—there is overlap
with other chronic liver disease: eg PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis.
Table 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I–II
I Seen in 80%. Typical patient:  <40yrs. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve
in 80% . Antinuclear antibody (ANA) +ve in 10%. IgG in 97%. Good response to
immunosuppression in 80%. 25% have cirrhosis at presentation.
II Commoner in Europe than USA. More often seen in children, and more commonly
progresses to cirrhosis and less treatable. Typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal
type 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve. ASMA and ANA Ωve.
Management Immunosuppressant therapy: Prednisolone 30mg/d PO for 1
month;  by 5mg a month to a maintenance dose of 5–10mg/d PO. Corticoster-
oids can sometimes be stopped after 2yrs but relapse occurs in 50–86%. Aza-
thioprine (50–100mg/d PO) may be used as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain
remission. Remission is achievable in 80% of patients within 3yrs. 10- and 20yr
survival rates are >80%. SES are a big problem (p376)—partly ameliorated by a
switch to budesonide, eg in non-cirrhotic AIH.
Liver transplantation: (See p277.) Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if
there is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is ef-
fective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%).
Prognosis Appears not to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at
presentation (10yr survival ~80% for both). The presence of cirrhosis at presenta-
tion reduces 10yr survival from 94% to 62%. Overlap syndromes: AIH-PBC (primary
biliary cholangitis) overlap is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis).
Associations of autoimmune hepatitis
•Pernicious anaemia •Autoimmune haemolysis
•Ulcerative colitis •Diabetes mellitus
•Glomerulonephritis •PSC (p282)
•Autoimmune thyroiditis •HLA A1, B8, and DR3 haplotype.
33 Hepatotropic viruses (eg measles, herpes viruses) and some drugs appear to trigger AIH in geneti-
cally predisposed individuals exposed to a hepatotoxic milieu intérieur. Viral interferon can inactivate
cytochrome P450 enzymes (  metabolism of ex- or endogenous hepatotoxins). Resulting modifi cations to
proteins may generate autoantigens driving CD4 T-helper cell activation.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
The commonest liver disorder in Western industrialized countries (prevalence≈20%),
NAFLD12 represents fat in hepatocytes (steatosis) visualized, eg on ultrasound that
cannot be attributed to other causes (most commonly alcohol so consider NAFLD if
drink <18U/wk, <9U). If infl ammation is also present (LFT, typically ALT) = non-al-
coholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Rule out other causes of liver disease (p284) and check
for associated metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension).
Progression to cirrhosis may occur—biopsy or elastography may be needed (p248).
Risk factors for progression Older age; obesity; DM; NASH. Treatment Control risk
factors, including obesity (bariatic surgery helps). Address cardiovascular risk (com-
monest cause of death, see p93). Avoid alcohol consumption. No drug is of proven
benefi t, though vitamin E may improve histology in fi brosis (eg 400IU/d—higher doses
associated with excess mortality). Follow-up Monitor for complications (NASH, cir-
rhosis, DM). If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly.
Wilson’s disease/hepatolenticular degeneration
Wilson’s disease is a rare (3/100 000) inherited disorder of copper excretion with excess
deposition in liver and CNS (eg basal ganglia). It is treatable, so screen all with cirrhosis.
Genetics An autosomal recessive disorder of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B.
Physiology Total body copper content is ~125mg. Intake ≈ 3mg/day (absorbed in
proximal small intestine). In the liver, copper is incorporated into caeruloplasmin. In
Wilson’s disease, copper incorporation into caeruloplasmin in hepatocytes and ex-
cretion into bile are impaired. Copper accumulates in liver, and later in other organs.
Signs Children present with liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, fulmin ant liver fail-
ure); young adults often start with CNS signs: tremor; dysarthria, dys pha gia; dyski-
nesias; dystonias; dementia; Parkinsonism; ataxia/clumsiness.
Mood: Depress ion/mania; labile emotions; libido; personality change. Ignoring
these may cause years of needless misery: often the doctor who is good at combin-
ing the analytical and integrative aspects will be the fi rst to make the diagnosis.
Cognition: Memory; slow to solve problems; IQ; delusions; mutism.
Kayser–Fleis cher (KF) rings: Copper in iris (see 6 in following list); they are not
invariable.
Also: Haemolysis; blue lunulae (nails); arthritis; hypermobile joints; grey skin.
Tests Equivocal copper studies need expert interpretation.
1 Urine: 24h copper excretion is high, eg >100mcg/24h (normal <40mcg).
2 LFT: non-specifi c (but ALT >1500 is not part of the picture).
3 Serum copper: typically <11μmol/L.
4 Serum caeruloplasmin: <200mg/L (<140mg/L is pathognomonic)—beware
incidental low values in protein-defi ciency states (eg nephrotic syndrome, mal-
absorption).
5 Molecular genetic testing can confi rm the diagnosis.
6 Slit lamp exam: KF rings: in iris/Descemet’s membrane (fi g 5.42 OHCS p452).
7 Liver biopsy: Hepatic copper (copper >250mcg/g dry weight); hepatitis; cirrhosis.
8 MRI: degeneration in basal ganglia, fronto-temporal, cerebellar, and brainstem.
Management Diet: Avoid foods with high copper content (eg liver, chocolate, nuts,
mushrooms, legumes, and shellfi sh). Check water sources (eg wells, pipes) for cop-
per. Drugs: Lifelong penicillamine (500mg/6–8h PO for 1yr, maintena nce 0.75–1g/d).
SES: nausea, rash, WCC, Hb, platelets, haematuria, nephrosis, lupus. Monitor FBC and
urinary copper and protein excretion. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) If severe
liver disease. Screen siblings: Asympto matic homozygotes need treating.
Prognosis Pre-cirrhotic liver disease is reversible; CNS damage less so. There are
no clear clinical prognostic indicators. Fatal events: liver failure, bleeding, infection.

Liver tumours
The commonest (90%) liver tumours are metastases (see fi g 6.32), eg from breast,
bronchus, or the gastrointestinal tract (see table 6.14). Primary hepatic tumours are
much less common and may be benign or malignant (see table 6.13).
Symptoms Fever, malaise, anorexia, weight, RUQ pain ( liver capsule stretch).
Jaundice is late, except with cholangiocarcinoma. Benign tumours are often
asymptomatic. Tumours may rupture causing intraperitoneal haemorrhage.
Signs Hepatomegaly (smooth, or hard and irregular, eg metastases, cirrhosis, HCC).
Look for signs of chronic liver disease (p276) and evidence of decompensation (jaun-
dice, ascites). Feel for an abdominal mass. Listen for a bruit over the liver (HCC).
Tests Blood: FBC, clotting, LFT, hepatitis serology, -fetoprotein ( in 50–80% of HCC,
though levels do not correlate with size, stage, or prognosis). Imaging: US or CT
to identify lesions and guide biopsy. MRI is better at distinguishing benign from ma-
lignant lesions. Do ERCP (p742) and biopsy if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. Liver
biopsy: (See p248.) May achieve a histological diagnosis; careful multidisciplinary
discussion is required if potentially resectable, as bleeding or seeding along the bi-
opsy tract can occur. If the lesion could be a metastasis, fi nd the primary, eg by CXR,
mammography, colono scopy, CT, MRI, or marrow biopsy.
Liver metastases Signify advanced disease. Treatment and prognosis vary with
the type and extent of primary tumour. Chemotherapy may be eff ective (eg lympho-
mas, germ cell tumours). Small, solitary metastases may be amenable to resection
(eg colorectal cancer). In most, treatment is palliative. Prognosis: Often <6 months.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Primary hepatocyte neoplasia accounts for 90%
of primary liver cancers; it is common in China & Africa (40% of cancers vs 2% in UK).
The patient: Fatigue, appetite, RUQ pain, weight, jaundice, ascites, haemobilia.34 : ≈ 3.
Causes: HBV is the leading cause worldwide (esp. if high viral load; p278). HCV;35 AIH
(p284); cirrhosis (alcohol, haemochrom atosis, PBC); non-alcoholic fatty liver; afl atox-
in; Clonorchis sinensis; anabolic steroids.
: 3-phase CT (delayed wash-out of contrast in a suspect mass); MRI; biopsy.
Treatment: Resecting solitary tumours <3cm across  3yr survival from 13% to 59%;
but ~50% have recurrence by 3yrs.36 Liver transplant gives a 5yr survival rate of
70%.37 Percutaneous ablation, tumour embolization (TACE38), and sorafenib are options.
Prevention: HBV vaccination (BOX and table 6.15). Don’t reuse needles. Screen
blood. Afl atox in exposure (sun-dry maize). AFP ± ultrasound (eg 6-monthly screen):
Consider if at  risk: eg all with cirrhosis; or chronic HBV in Africans or older Asians.
Cholangiocarcinoma (Biliary tree cancer.) ~10% of liver primaries. Causes: Flukes
(Clonorchis, p435); PSC (screening by CA19–9 may be helpful, p282); biliary cysts; Caro-
li’s disease, p272; HBV; HCV; DM; N-nitroso toxins.
The patient: Fever, abdominal pain (± ascites), malaise, bilirubin; ALP.
Pathology: Usually slow-growing. Most are distal extrahepatic or perihilar.
Management: 70% inoperable at presentation. Of those that are, 76% recur. Surgery:
eg major hepatectomy + extrahepatic bile duct excision + caudate lobe rese c tion. 5yr
survival ~30%. Post-op complications include liver failure, bile leak, and GI bleeding.
Stenting of obstructed extrahepatic biliary tree, percutaneously or via ERCP (p742),
improves quality of life. Liver transplantation rarely possible. Prognosis: ~5 months.
Benign tumours Haemangiomas: The commonest benign liver tumours. They are
often an incidental fi nding on ultrasound or CT and don’t require treatment. Avoid
biopsy! Adenomas: Common. Causes: anabolic steroids, oral contraceptive pill;
pregnancy. Only treat if symptomatic, or >5cm.
34 Haemobilia is late in HCC. Think of bleeding into the biliary tree whenever Quincke’s triad obtains: RUQ
pain, upper GI haemorrhage, and jaundice. It may be life-threatening.
35 5yr cumulative risk if cirrhosis is present is 30% in Japan and 17% in USA.
36 Operative mortality: 1.6%. Recurrence is more likely if histology showed neoplastic emboli in small
vessels. Get early warning of recurrence by arranging imaging, eg if AFP >5.45mcg/L (esp. if trend is ris-
ing). Fibrolamellar HCC, which occurs in children and young adults, has a better prognosis.
37 Milan criteria for liver transplantation in HCC: 1 nodule <5cm or 2–3 nodules <3cm.
38 TACE=transarterial chemoembolization, eg with drug-eluting beads; it causes fever and abdo pain in 50%.

Vaccinating to prevent hepatitis B (and associated complications)
Use hepatitis B vaccine 1mL into deltoid; repeat at 1 & 6 mon ths (child: 0.5mL ≈ 3
into the anterolateral thigh). Indications: Everyone (WHO advice, even in areas
of ‘low’ endemicity—in 2014 this meant that 82% of the world’s children received
protection against HBV). This contrasts with the approach in eg the UK and USA of
targeting at-risk groups (p278). The immunocompromised and others may need
further doses. Serology helps time boosters and fi nds non-responders (correlates
with older age, smoking, and  sex). Know your own antibody level!
Table 6.15 Post-immunization anti-HBs titres and actions
Anti-HBs (IU/L) Actions and comments (advice diff ers in some areas)
>1000 Good level of immunity; retest in ~4yrs.
100–1000 Good level of immunity; if level approaches 100, retest in 1yr.
<100 Inadequate; give booster and retest.
<10 Non-responder; give another set of 3 vaccinations. Retest; if <10 get
consent to check hepatitis B status: HBSAg +ve means chronic infection;
anti-HB core +ve represents past infection and immunity. If a non-re-
sponder is deemed susceptible to HBV, and has recently come in contact
with risky bodily fl uids, off er 2 doses of anti-hep B immunoglobulin.
NB: protection begins some weeks after dose 1, so it won’t work if exposure is rec-
ent; here, specifi c antihepatitis B immunoglobulin is best if not already immunized.

Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH)
An inherited disorder of iron metabolism in which intestinal iron absorption leads to
iron deposition in joints, liver, heart, pancreas, pituitary, adrenals, and skin. Middle-
aged men are more frequently and severely aff ected than women, in whom the dis-
ease tends to present ~10yrs later (menstrual blood loss is protective).
Genetics HH is one of the commonest inherited conditions in those of Northern Euro-
pean (especially Celtic) ancestry (carrier rate of ~1 in 10 and a frequency of homozy-
gosity of ~1 in 200–400). The gene responsible for most HH is HFE: the 2 commonest
mutations are termed C282Y and H63D. C282Y accounts for 60–90% of HH, and H63D
accounts for 1–3%, with compound heterozygotes accounting for 4–7%. Penetrance
is variable—a signifi cant fraction of C282Y homozygotes will not develop signs of iron
overload during follow-up, complicating screening decisions.
The patient Early on: Nil—or tiredness; arthralgia (2nd+3rd MCP joints + knee pseudo-
gout); libido. Later: Slate-grey skin pigmentation; signs of chronic liver disease
(p276); hepatomegaly; cirrhosis (esp. if drinks alcohol); dilated cardiomyopathy.
Endocrinopathies: DM (‘bronze diabetes’ from iron deposition in pancreas); hypogonadism
(p232) from pituitary dysfunction.
Tests Blood: LFT, ferritin (>200/>150ng/mL; but infl ammation will also ferritin);
transferrin saturation39 should all trigger suspicion. Confi rm by HFE genotyping.
Images: Chondro calcinosis (fi g 6.33). Liver & cardiac MRI: Fe overload.
Liver biopsy: Perl’s stain quantifi es iron loading40 and assesses disease severity.
Management Venesect: ~0.5–2 units/1–2wks, until ferritin 50mcg/L (may take 2yrs).
Iron will continue to accumulate, so maintenance venesection is needed for life (1U every
2–3 months to maintain haematocrit <0.5, ferritin <100mcg/L, and transferrin saturation
<40%). Consider desferrioxamine (p342) if intolerant of this. Monitor: LFT and glucose/
diabetes (p206). HbA1c levels may be falsely low as venesection  the time available for
Hb glycosylation. If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly.
Over-the-counter drugs: Ensure vitamin preparations contain no iron.
Diet: A well-balanced diet should be encouraged—there is no need to avoid iron-rich
foods. Avoid alcohol. Avoid uncooked seafood (may contain bacteria that thrive on
increased plasma iron concentrations, eg Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnifi cus).
Screening: Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and HFE genotype. Screen 1st-
degree relatives by genetic testing even if they are asymptomatic and have normal
LFT ideally prior to age where signifi cant iron deposition likely to have occurred (eg
18–30yrs). Since C282Y homozygotes may never develop iron overload, population
screening should not be performed.
Prognosis Venesection returns life expectancy to normal if non-diabetic and non-cir-
rhotic (and liver histology can improve). Arthropathy may improve or worsen. Gonadal
failure may reverse in younger men. If cirrhosis, 22–30% get hepatocellular cancer,
especially if: age >50yrs (risk  ≈ 13), HBsAg +ve (risk  ≈ 5), or alcohol abuse (risk  ≈ 2).
39 Transferrin saturation >45% is a sensitive threshold for further screening but will lead to some false +ves.
40 Although generally not required, biopsy quantifi es hepatic iron loading and fi brosis. This helps deter-
mine the severity of liver disease, particularly in those with other underlying causes of chronic liver disease.

A bit about iron metabolism
60% of body iron is in haemoglobin, and erythropoiesis requires ~5–30mg iron/
day—provided by macrophages (recycling of haeme iron after phagocytosis of old
RBCs). Intestinal iron absorption (1–2mg/day) compensates for daily iron losses.
Red meats, liver, seafoods, enriched breakfast cereals and pulses, and some
spices (eg paprika) are iron-rich. Most dietary iron is Fe3+, which is reduced by
low gastric pH and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to better-absorbed Fe2+. Absorption
occurs mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, though very small amounts are ab-
sorbed in the stomach and ileum. Iron requirements are greater for women (men-
strual loss), when growing, in pregnancy, and in chronic infection.
Hepcidin, a peptide synthesized in hepatocytes, secreted in plasma, is a negative
regulator of gut iron absorption and haeme iron recycling by macrophages.
Hepcidin synthesis is stimulated by iron and repressed by iron defi ciency and by
 marrow erythropoiesis (eg in anaemia, bleeding, haemolysis, dyserythropoiesis, or
erythropoietin injections). Defects in the normal triggering of hepcidin by iron excess
is a rare cause of haemochromatosis unrelated to HFE mutations, whereas a defect
in hepcidin repression is responsible for an iron refractory iron defi ciency anaemia.
In HH, the total body iron is up to 10-fold that of a normal person, with load-
ing found particularly in the liver and pancreas (≈100). Hepatic disease classically
starts with fi brosis, progressing to cirrhosis as a late feature.

-antitrypsin (A1AT) defi ciency
1
A1AT defi ciency is an inherited disorder aff ecting lung (emphysema) and liver (cirrho-
sis and HCC). A1AT is a glycoprotein and one of a family of serine protease inhibitors made
in the liver that control infl ammatory cascades. Defi ciency is called a serpinopathy.
It makes up 90% of serum 1-glob ulin on electrophoresis (p687). A1AT defi ciency is
the chief genetic cause of liver disease in children. In adults, its lack is more likely
to cause emphy sema. Lung A1AT protects against tissue damage from neutrophil
elastase—a process that is also induced by cigarette smoking (p184). Prevalence
~1:4000 (higher in Caucasians).
Genetics Genetic variants of A1AT are typed by electro phor etic mobility as medium
(M), slow (S), or very slow (Z). S and Z types are due to single amino acid substitutions
at positions 264 and 342, respectively. These result in production of 1-antitrypsin
(S=60%, Z=15%). The normal genotype is PiMM, the high risk homozygote is PiZZ; het-
erozygotes are PiMZ and PiSZ (at low risk of developing liver disease).
The patient Symptomatic patients usually have the PiZZ genotype: dyspnoea from
emphysema; cirrhosis; cholestatic jaundice. Cholestasis often remits in adolescence.
Tests Serum 1-antitrypsin (1AT) levels , usually (eg <11μmol/L or <75% of lower
limit of normal, which is ~0.9g/L; labs vary). Note the ‘usually’. Because A1AT is part of
the acute-phase response, infl ammation may hide a low level. Unless you do genotyp-
ing, you will inevitably mis-label some cirrhosis as cryptogenic. Lung function testing:
Shows reductions in FEV1 with obstructive pattern (p162). There may be some bronch-
dilator reversibility. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) +ve; diastase-re-
sistant globules. Phenotyping: By isoelectric focusing requires expertise to distinguish
SZ and ZZ phenotypes. Phenotyping can miss null phenotypes. Prenatal diagnosis: Pos-
sible by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples obtained at 11–13wks’ gestation.
Management Smoki ng cessation. Prompt treatment/preventative vaccination for
lung infections. Giving IV A1AT pooled from human plasma is expensive but COPD ex-
acerbations may be prevented (no good randomized trials). Liver transplantation:
Needed in decompensated cirrhosis. Lung transplantation: Improves survival and
has a comparable survival to transplantation in non-A1AT-defi cient COPD. Inhaled
A1AT: Has been tried in lung disease.
Prognosis Some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas
others remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. Worse prognosis if male, a
smoker, or obese. Emphysema is the cause of death in most, liver disease in ~5%. In
adults, cirrhosis ± HCC aff ect 25% of A1AT-defi cient adults >50yrs.

Approaches to abnormal liver function tests (LFTS)
Abnormal LFTS can be found in ~17% of the asymptomatic general population. Also,
remember that a normal LFT does not exclude liver disease.
Tests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis
Aminotransferases: (AST, ALT) Released in the bloodstream after hepatocellular
injury. ALT is more specifi c for hepatocellular injury (but also expressed in kidney
and muscle). AST is also expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and RBCS.
Alkaline phosphatase: May originate from liver, bone (so raised in growing chil-
dren) or placenta.
Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; GT): Present in liver, pancreas, renal tubules,
and intestine—but not bone, so it helps tell if a raised ALP is from bone (GGT) or
liver (GGT). NB: it is not specifi c to alcohol damage to the liver.
Tests of hepatic function Serum albumin, serum bilirubin, PT (INR).
Hepatocellular predominant liver injury AST & ALT. Evaluate promptly, consid-
er medications, collateral history from family (‘Could he be consuming alcohol?’);
ultrasound for fatty liver, metastases , viral serology (hepatitis A, B, C, E, EBV, CMV).
Alcoholic liver disease: AST/ALT ratio is typically 2:1 or more. When the history is
not reliable, normal ALP, GGT, and macrocytosis suggest this condition.
Acute viral hepatitis: ALT; bilirubin may be . NB: AST may be , p278, p281.
Chronic viral hepatitis: ALT; HBV & C are a leading cause worldwide.
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH): Occurs mainly in young and middle-aged females.
Fatty infi ltration of the liver: (See p285.) Probably the chief cause of mildly
raised LFTS in the general population and may be recognized on ultrasound.
Ischaemic hepatitis: Can be seen in conditions when eff ective circulatory volume
is low (eg MI, hypotension, haemorrhage). ALT, as well as LDH.
Drug-induced hepatitis: As no specifi c serology identifi es most culprits, a good
history is vital. Paracetamol overdose causes most acute liver failure in the UK.
Cholestasis predominant liver injury ALP and GGT are ; AST and ALT mildly.
Management For each specifi c diagnosis, manage accordingly. If asymptomatic
and other tests are Ωve, try lifestyle modifi cation. Help reduce weight and alcohol
use (p280 & OHCS p512); control DM & dyslipidaemia; stop hepatotoxic drugs.
Follow-up Repeat tests after 1–2 months; if still , do US (± abdominal CT). If di-
agnosis still unclear, get help: is biopsy needed? Consider (if you haven’t already)
1-antitrypsin levels, serum caeruloplasmin (Wilson’s disease), coeliac serology,
ANA and ASMA (AIH, p284).

Fig 7.1 A ‘rotating drum artifi cial kidney’: one of
the earliest dialysis machines built by Willem Kolff
in 1943. Exiled to a remote Dutch hospital during the
Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, the resourceful
inventor assembled a junkyard construction using
a water pump from a Ford model T, an aluminium
drum from a downed warplane, washing machine
parts, orange juice cans, and sausage skins. The
fi rst 16 patients to use the machine died. Then, in
1945, 67-year-old Sofi a Maria Schafstadt (‘Patient
Number 17’) was referred reluctantly to Kolff with
‘poisoning’. Her blood was passed through his
sausage-skin tube which was wrapped around the
drum, rotating like a washing machine in a bath of
salt water. A total of 80L of her blood was treated
in this way, removing 60g of urea. After 11 hours she
opened her eyes to declare, ‘I’m going to divorce my
husband’. This she duly achieved, as well as making
medical history. Kolff chose not to patent his life-
saving invention but donated copies to hospitals
across the world.
We thank Dr Andrew Mooney, our Specialist Reader, for his contribution to this chapter.

Renal disease presents as:
293
1 Asymptomatic disease
• Non-visible haematuria: (NVH, microscopic haematuria.) Detected on urine
dipstick on repeated testing. Most is not due to renal disease and urological
investigation is fi rst-line for all those aged >40 years. See p294.
• Asymptomatic proteinuria: Normal renal protein excretion is less than
150mg/24 hours (non-pregnant). Quantifi cation by 24h urine collection is unreli-
able and rarely used in clinical practice. A spot urinary protein to creatinine
ratio (P:CR) >15mg/mmol or urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (A:CR) >2.5()
or 3.5()mg/mmol may signify either glomerular (common) or tubular (rare)
pathology.
• Abnormal renal function (GFR): The glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) is a meas-
ure of how much blood the kidneys are cleaning per minute. Direct measure-
ment is invasive and time-consuming. Estimations derived from equations
based on serum creatinine are widely used to give an eGFR (see p669). Errors in
eGFR are caused by non-steady-state conditions, conditions which alter serum
creatinine (diet, muscle mass), and eGFR is less accurate at higher levels of GFR.
eGFR is therefore only part of the assessment of renal function.
• High blood pressure: A renal aetiology should be excluded if hypertension oc-
curs with any indicators of renal disease: haematuria, proteinuria, eGFR.
• Electrolyte abnormalities: Disorders of sodium, potassium, and acid–base bal-
ance (pp301 and 670–5) may be due to underlying renal disease.
2 With renal tract symptoms
• Urinary symptoms: Dysuria is a sensation of discomfort with micturition and
may be accompanied by urgency, frequency, and nocturia. UTI is the primary
diff erential. Consider prostatic aetiology if there is diffi culty initiating voiding,
poor stream and dribbling. Oliguria (<400mL/24 hours or <0.5mL/kg/hour) and
anuria should trigger assessment and investigation for acute kidney injury
(AKI) (see pp298–301). Poly uria is the voiding of abnormally high volumes of
urine, usually from high fl uid intake. Consider also DM, diabetes insipidus (p240),
hypercalcaemia (p676), renal medullary disorders (causing impaired concentra-
tion of urine).
• Loin pain: Ureteric colic is severe and radiates anteriorly and to the groin. It is
caused by a renal stone, clot, or a sloughed papilla. For pain confi ned to the loin
consider pyelonephritis, renal cyst pathology, and renal infarct.
• Visible haematuria: (VH, macroscopic.) Urological investigation is required to
exclude renal tract malignancy. Nephrological causes include polycystic kidney
disease and glomerular disease (IgA p311, anti-glomerular basement membrane
(anti-GBM) disease p311, Alport syndrome p320).
• Nephrotic syndrome: Proteinuria >3g/24 hours (=P:CR >300mg/mmol) with
hypoalbuminaemia (<30g/L) and peripheral oedema. Renal biopsy is usually
indicated in adults (p310).
• Symptomatic chronic kidney disease: Dyspnoea, anorexia, weight loss, pruri-
tus, bone pain, sexual dysfunction, cognitive decline (pp302–5).
3 A systemic disorder with renal involvement
• DM: (p314.)
• Metabolic: Sickle cell disease (p315), tuberous sclerosis (p320), Fabry disease
(p320), cystinosis (p321).
• Auto-immune: ANCA-associated vasculitis (p314, 556), SLE (p314), Henoch–
Schonlein purpura (p311), systemic sclerosis (p315), sarcoid (p318), Sjögren’s
syndrome (p318, 710).
• Infection: Sepsis is a common cause of AKI. Specifi c renal involvement may oc-
cur with TB (p392), malaria, chronic hepatitis (p278), HIV (pp398–403).
• Malignancy: Obstruction, hypercalcaemia, direct toxicity, eg myeloma (p314).
• Pregnancy: Pre-eclampsia, obstruction.
• Drugs used in systemic disorders: NSAIDS, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides, chemo-
therapy.

Urine
Perform dipstick urinalysis whenever you suspect renal disease. This is a crude way
of checking whether the urine contains anything that it should not, eg protein, blood,
glucose. Abnormalities can indicate intrinsic renal disease or renal tract abnormali-
ties and usually require further investigation. However, a dipstick-positive catheter
sample is diffi cult to interpret.
Look for a urine dip result (before the catheter was inserted). A positive result
indicates the need for specialist advice from nephrology/urology. A negative result
may help to reassure you about the absence of intrinsic renal disease.
Proteinuria
Requires quantifi cation. 24h collections are rarely used due to inaccuracy.
Albumin:creatinine ratio (A:CR) or protein:creatinine ratio (P:CR) is performed on a
random spot urine sample. Normal A:CR is <2.5() or <3.5(). P:CR is <15. Approximate
equivalent levels of proteinuria are given in table 7.1.
Table 7.1 Conversion factors
Protein excretion g/24h A:CR mg/mmol P:CR mg/mmol
0.15 (physiological) 2.5  or 3.5  15
0.5 30 50
1 70 100
3 (nephrotic range) 250 300
Causes of raised A:CR/P:CR: The higher the proteinuria, the more chance it is caused
by glomerular disease, eg glomerulonephritis, DM, amyloidosis, myeloma (though
dipsticks do not detect light chains). Proteinuria is associated with an risk of cardio-
vascular disease and death. False positive: Postural (repeat using an early morning
sample), post-exercise, fever, heart failure.
Microalbuminuria: Ultra-sensitive dipsticks are available to measure albuminuria
(albumin excretion 30–300mg/24h). Suggests early glomerular disease, eg DM, BP.
Haematuria
Blood in the urine may arise from anywhere in the renal tract. Transient causes
should be excluded, eg UTI, menstruation. Classifi ed as:
• visible (VH): previously known as macroscopic, frank
• non-visible (NVH): found on dipstick/microscopy, previously known as microscopic.
NVH is subdivided according to the presence of urinary tract symptoms: sympto-
matic (SNVH) or asymptomatic (aNVH).
Causes: Malignancy (kidney, ureter, bladder), calculi, IgA nephropathy, Alport syn-
drome (p320), other glomerulonephritis (p310), polycystic kidney disease (p320),
schistosomiasis. Do not attribute haematuria to anticoagulation without investiga-
tion. False positive: Myoglobin triggers same dipstick reaction—check microscopy.
Management: VH, SNVH, and aNVH >40yr should undergo urological assessment, im-
aging, and cystoscopy to exclude renal tract malignancy and calculi.
A renal aetiology should be considered, and renal referral made, for NVH with:
• eGFR <60
• coexistent proteinuria (A:CR >30 or P:CR >50)
• hypertension >140/90mmHg
• family history of renal disease.
A cause is not established in 19–68% of patients with NVH. These patients should be
monitored via BP, eGFR, and repeat A:CR/P:CR every 6 months–1 year. Increasing pro-
teinuria and deteriorating eGFR warrant repeat referral and investigation.
Others
Glucose: DM, pregnancy, sepsis, proximal renal tubular pathology (p316). Ketones:
Starvation, ketoa cidosis. Leucocytes: UTI (p296), vaginal discharge. Nitrites: UTI
(enteric GramΩve organism). Bilirubin: Haemolysis. Urobilinogen: Liver disease,
haemolysis. Specifi c gravity: Normal range: 1.005–1.030, limited surrogate for urine
osmolality, aff ected by proteinuria. pH: NR: 4.5–9, usually acidic with meat containing
diet (acid–base balance: p670, renal tubular acidosis pp316–7).

Urine microscopy
Cells:
Red blood cells:
• >2 red cells/mm3 is abnormal.
• Can come from anywhere in the urinary tract. Isomorphic red cells are similar to
circulating red cells and may suggest bleeding from a genitourinary or external
source. Dysmorphic red cells are abnormal in size/shape. Although they may in-
dicate bleeding from the glomerulus (especially in exam questions!), assessment
is subjective and dysmorphism also occurs due to changes in pH, osmolality,
protein, and due to tubular passage.
White blood cells: (fi g 7.2a)
• >10 white cells/mm3 in an unspun specimen is abnormal.
• Causes include UTI, glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal trans-
plant rejection, and malignancy.
Squamous epithelial cells:
• Often seen, not pathological.
Casts:
Casts are cylindrical bodies formed in the lumen of distal tubules. They are formed
of Tamm-Horsfall protein combined with cells.
• Hyaline cast (fi g 7.2b)—seen in normal urine.
• Red cell cast (fi g 7.2c)—signify an infl ammatory process in the glomerulus, eg
glomerulonephritis (p311).
• White cell cast (fi g 7.2d)—pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis (p318), glomeru-
lonephritis (p311).
• Granular cast (fi g 7.2e)—formed from degenerated tubular cells, seen in any
chronic kidney disease.
Crystals:
Crystals are common in old or cold urine and may not signify pathology. They are
important in stone formers.
• Uric acid (fi g 7.2f)(p680)—uric acid stones, tumour lysis syndrome.
• Calcium oxalate (fi g 7.2g)—stones (p638), high oxalate diet, ethylene glycol poi-
soning.
• Cystine (fi g 7.2h)—seen in cystinuria (p321).

Urinary tract infection (UTI)
Defi nitions Bacteriuria: Bacteria in the urine; may be asymptomatic or sympto-
matic. Bacteriuria is not a disease. UTI:1 A diagnosis based on symptoms and signs.
Tests which prove bacteria in urine may provide additional information. There is no
‘gold-standard’ bacterial count. Lower UTI: Bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis).
Upper UTI: Pyelonephritis = infection of kidney/renal pelvis. Abacterial cystitis/ure-
thral syndrome: A diagnosis of exclusion in patients with dysuria and frequency,
without demonstrable infection. Urethritis: See pp412–3.
Incidence Annual incidence of UTI in women is 10–20%. 10% of men and 20% of
women >65 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria (>65 years MSU is no longer diagnos-
tic and clinical assessment is mandatory). Pyelonephritis = 3 per 1000 patient years.
Classifi cation
• Uncomplicated: normal renal tract structure and function.
• Complicated: structural/functional abnormality of genitourinary tract, eg obstruc-
tion, catheter, stones, neurogenic bladder, renal transplant.
Risk factors
• Bacterial inoculation: Sexual activity, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence,
constipation.
• Binding of uropathogenic bacteria: Spermicide use, oestrogen, menopause.
• Urine fl ow: Dehydration, obstructed urinary tract (p640).
• Bacterial growth: DM, immunosuppression, obstruction, stones, catheter, renal
tract malformation, pregnancy.
Symptoms
• Cystitis: Frequency, dysuria, urgency, suprap ubic pain, polyuria, haematuria.
• Acute pyelonephritis: Fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral
pain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock.
• Prostatitis: Pain: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis, bladder, lower back. Fever,
malaise, nausea, urinary symptoms, swollen or tender prostate on PR. See p645.
Signs Fever, abdominal or loin tenderness. Check for a distended bladder, enlarged
prostate. If vaginal discharge, consider PID, see p413.
Do not rely on classical symptoms and signs in a catheterized patient.
Tests In non-pregnant women, if ≥ 3 (or one severe) symptoms of cystitis, and no
vaginal discharge, treat empirically without further tests.
• Dipstick: Use in non-pregnant women <65 years with less than three symptoms.
A negative dipstick reduces probability of UTI to <20%. Do not use in pregnant
women. Limited data for men. No diagnostic value in catheterized sample.
• MSU culture: Conventional cut off >105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL (but best di-
agnostic criterion may be >102–103cfu/mL). Use in pregnant women, men, children,
and if fail to respond to empirical antibiotics. Catheterized sample only if septic.
• Blood tests: If systemically unwell: FBC, U&E, CRP, and blood culture (positive in only
10–25% of pyelonephritis). Consider fasting glucose.
• Imaging: Consider USS and referral to urology for assessment (cystoscopy, urody-
namics, CT) in men with upper UTI; failure to respond to treatment; recurrent UTI
(>2/year); pyelonephritis; unusual organism; persistent haematuria.
Organisms Usually anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria from bowel and vaginal
fl ora. E. coli is the main organism (75–95% in community but  in hospital). Staphylo-
coccus saprophyticus (a skin commensal) in 5–10%. Other enterobacteriaceae such
as Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumonia. For sterile pyuria see table 7.2.

Managing UTI
Do not use antibiotics for the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-
pregnant women, men, and adults with catheters.
Non-pregnant women:
• If three or more symptoms (or one severe) of cystitis, and no vaginal discharge,
treat empirically with 3-day course of trimethoprim, or nitrofurantoin (if eGFR
>30).
• If fi rst-line empirical treatment fails, culture urine and treat according to anti-
biotic sensitivity.
• In upper UTI, take a urine culture and treat initially with a broad-spectrum antibi-
otic according to local guidelines/sensitivities, eg co-amoxiclav. Hospitalization
should be considered due to risk of antibiotic resistance. Avoid nitrofurantoin as
it does not achieve eff ective concentrations in the blood.
Pregnant women:
Get expert help: UTI in pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery and intrau-
terine growth restriction. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should be confi rmed on a
second sample. Treat with an antibiotic. Refer to local guidance advice for antibi-
otic choice (avoid ciprofl oxacin, trimethoprim in 1st trimester, nitrofurantoin in 3rd
trimester). Confi rm eradication.
Men:
• Treat lower UTI with a 7-day course of trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin (if eGFR >30).
• If symptoms suggest prostatitis (pain in pelvis, genitals, lower back, buttocks)
consider a longer (4-week) course of a fl uoroquinolone (eg ciprofl oxacin) due to
ability to penetrate prostatic fl uid.
• If upper or recurrent UTI, refer for urological investigation.
Catheterized patients:
• All catheterized patients are bacteriuric. Send MSU only if symptomatic. Symp-
toms of UTI may be non-specifi c/atypical. Possible symptoms include fever, fl ank/
suprapubic pain, change in voiding pattern, vomiting, confusion, sepsis.
• Change long-term catheter before starting an antibiotic.
• Refer to local guidelines for initial antibiotic choice. Where possible use a narrow-
spectrum antibiotic according to culture sensitivity.
Urinary tract tuberculosis
• A cause of sterile pyuria: dysuria, frequency, suprapubic pain but negative stand-
ard culture. Ask about malaise, fever, night sweats, weight loss, back/fl ank pain,
visible haematuria (p393).
• Can also cause an interstitial nephritis (p318) and renal amyloidosis (p315). Glo-
merulonephritis is rare.
• Diagnose by microscopy with acid-fast techniques and mycobacterial culture of
an early morning MSU and/or urinary tract tissue.
• Treat with rifampicin and isoniazid for 6 months in conjunction with pyrazina-
mide and ethambutol for 2 months (see p394).
The ‘Piss Prophets’
Beware the fallacies, deceit and juggling of the piss-pot science used by
all those who pretend knowledge of diseases by the urine. Thomas Brian, 1655.
Medieval texts1 give the following maxims regarding urinary change and disease:
• White or straw coloured urine = weak and cold liver and stomach
• Foamy urine = eructation (belching)
• Light coloured, turbid urine = mucus
• Lead circle on thin urine = pathological melancholy
• Bubbles on the surface = disease of the head
• Watery urine = love sickness
• Swampy, black, stinking urine = fatal
• Lead coloured urine = a disintegrating uterus
• Reddish, cloudy urine with bubbles = asthma or an irregular heart beat.

Acute kidney injury (AKI): a clinical approach
Defi nition
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a syndrome of decreased renal function, measured by
serum creatinine or urine output, occurring over hours–days. It includes diff erent
aetiologies and may be multifactorial.
Diff erent defi nitions of AKI exist. In 2012, there was an attempt to amalgamate
diff erent diagnostic criteria into a single defi nition and staging system. The Kidney
Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines2 defi ne AKI as:
• rise in creatinine >26μmol/L within 48h.
• rise in creatinine >1.5 ≈ baseline (ie before the AKI) within 7 days.
• urine output <0.5mL/kg/h for >6 consecutive hours.
The severity of AKI is then staged according to the highest creatinine rise or longest
period/severity of oliguria (table 7.3).
Table 7.3 KDIGO staging system for AKI
Stage Serum creatinine Urine output
1 >26.5μmol/L (0.3mg/dL) or <0.5mL/kg/h for 6–12h
1.5–1.9 ≈ baseline
2 2.0–2.9 ≈ baseline <0.5mL/kg/h for >12h
3 >353.6μmol/L (4.0mg/dL) or <0.3mL/kg/h for >24h or
>3.0 ≈ baseline or anuria for >12h
renal replacement therapy
Although there are limitations to the use of serum creatinine, including the eff ects
of muscle mass and dilution, no other biomarker has been able to supersede it (yet).
The clinical approach to AKI is shown in fi g 7.3.3
Epidemiology
AKI is common, occurring in up to 18% of hospital patients and ~50% of ICU patients.
Risk factors for AKI include pre-existing CKD, age, male sex, and comorbidity (DM,
cardiovascular disease, malignancy, chronic liver disease, complex surgery).
Causes
Commonest causes:
1 Sepsis.
2 Major surgery.
3 Cardiogenic shock.
4 Other hypovolaemia.
5 Drugs.
6 Hepatorenal syndrome.
7 Obstruction.
Aetiology can be divided according to site (table 7.4) as:
• pre-renal: perfusion to the kidney.
• renal: intrinsic renal disease.
• post-renal: obstruction to urine.
Table 7.4 Aetiology of AKI
Where? Pathology Example
Pre-renal Vascular volume Haemorrhage, D&V, burns, pancreatitis
Cardiac output Cardiogenic shock, MI
Systemic vasodilation Sepsis, drugs
Renal vasoconstriction NSAIDs, ACE-i, ARB, hepatorenal syndrome
Renal Glomerular (pp310–13) Glomerulonephritis, ATN (prolonged renal hypo-
perfusion causing intrinsic renal damage)
Interstitial (p318) Drug reaction, infection, infi ltration (eg sarcoid)
Vessels (pp314–5) Vasculitis, HUS, TTP, DIC
Post-renal Within renal tract Stone, renal tract malignancy, stricture, clot
Extrinsic compression Pelvic malignancy, prostatic hypertrophy, retro-

Acute kidney injury (AKI): management
Management of AKI requires diagnosis and treatment of the underlying aetiology:
• Pre-renal: correct volume depletion and/or renal perfusion via circulatory/cardiac
support, treat any underlying sepsis.
• Renal: refer for likely biopsy and specialist treatment of intrinsic renal disease.
• Post-renal: catheter, nephrostomy, or urological intervention.
Common to all aetiologies of AKI is the need to manage fl uid balance, acidosis, hyper-
kalaemia, and the timely recognition of those who may require renal replacement.
Fluid balance
Volume status:
• Hypovolaemia: BP, urine volume, non-visible JVP, poor tissue turgor, pulse, daily
weight loss.
• Fluid overload: BP, JVP, lung crepitations, peripheral oedema, gallop rhythm.
Hypotension may be relative in old age, vascular stiff ness, untreated BP.
JVP does not refl ect intravascular volume if right-sided heart disease/failure.
BP, skin turgor, capillary refi ll changes may be late—do not wait for them.
Hypovolaemia, fl uid resuscitation:
• If hypovolaemic, renal perfusion will improve with volume replacement.4
• Care in cardiac disease (renal perfusion despite adequate circulating volume)
and sepsis/third-spacing (extravascular volume).
• Dynamic assessment is essential: examine before and after all fl uid given to
ensure an adequate response and to reduce the risk of fl uid overload.
1 Give5 00mL crystalloid over 15 min.
2 Reassess fl uid state. Get expert help if unsure or if patient remains shocked.
3 Further boluses of2 50–500mL crystalloid with clinical review after each.
4 Stop when euvolaemic or seek expert help when2 L given.
Which crystalloid? Any crystalloid can be used (follow local guidelines). 0.9%
(‘normal’) saline is non-buff ered, contains chloride, and may cause hyperchlo-
raemic acidosis. ‘Balanced’ or buff ered crystalloids include Hartmann’s, Ringer’s
lactate, and Plasma-Lyte®. Because they are ‘balanced’ they are often used prefer-
entially. However, they contain 4–5mmol/L of K+ so caution if K+and oligo/anuria.
What about colloid? Blood components should be used in resuscitation due to
haemorrhage. Human albumin solutions may be given only under specialist advice
in hepatorenal syndrome and as second line to crystalloids in septic shock.
Hypervolaemia, fl uid overload:
Occurs due to aggressive fl uid resuscitation, oliguria, and in sepsis due to capillary
permeability. Monitor weight daily in patients receiving IV fl uids. Treat with:
• Oxygen supplementation if required.
• Fluid restriction. Consider oral and IV volumes. Give antibiotics in minimal fl uid
and consider concentrated nutritional support preparations.
• Diuretics. Only in symptomatic fl uid overload. They are ineff ective and poten-
tially harmful if used to treat oliguria without fl uid overload.
• Renal replacement therapy (p306). AKI with fl uid overload and oligo/anuria needs
urgent referral to renal/critical care.
Acidosis
• Mild = pH 7.30–7.36 (~bicarbonate >20mmol/L).
• Moderate = pH 7.20–7.29 (~bicarbonate 10–19mmol/L).
• Severe = pH <7.2 (~bicarbonate <10mmol/L): refer to renal/critical care.
Treatment is of the underlying disorder which will stop acid production. Where
the eff ect of treatment may be delayed, acidosis will persist and renal replace-
ment may be indicated (p306).
Medical management of acidosis is controversial. Giving sodium bicarbonate will
generate CO2. Adequate ventilation is therefore needed to prevent respiratory acido-
sis worsening the clinical picture. Sodium bicarbonate also represents a sodium and
a volume load which can precipitate fl uid overload in the vulnerable patient.

Hyperkalaemia
Fig 7.4 ECG showing severe hyperkalaemia; note broadening of QRS complexes.
ECG changes: In order: tall ‘tented’ T waves; increased PR interval; small or absent
P wave; widened QRS complex (fi g 7.4); ‘sine wave’ pattern; asystole. There is con-
siderable inter-individual susceptibility.
Don’t wait for a lab result: use the blood gas analyser.
Treat5 K+ >6.5mmol/L or any with ECG changes (ECG for all K+ >6.0mmol/L):
1 10mL of 10% calcium chloride2 (or 30mL of 10% calcium gluconate) IV via a
big vein over 5–10min, repeated if necessary and if ECG changes persist. This is
cardioprotective (for 30–60min) but does not treat K+ level.
2 Intravenous insulin (10u soluble insulin) in 25g glucose (50mL of 50% or 125mL
of 20% glucose). Insulin stimulates intracellular uptake of K+, lowering serum
K+ by 0.65–1.0mmol/L over 30–60min. Monitor hourly for hypoglycaemia (in
11–75% of treated patients) which may be delayed in renal impairment (up to
6 hours after infusion).
3 Salbutamol also causes an intracellular K+ shift but high doses are required
(10–20mg via nebulizer) and tachycardia can limit use (10mg dose in IHD, avoid
in tachyarrhythmias).
4 Defi nitive treatment requires K+ removal. If the underlying pathology cannot
be corrected renal replacement may be indicated. Safe transfer to an off site
renal unit requires K+ <6.5mmol/L—discuss with renal team and critical care.
Use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate is controversial with insuffi cient evidence
that it has any additional benefi t over the treatment steps listed here. There is a
risk of both sodium and fl uid overload. Bolus doses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate
should not be used.
Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in AKI
RRT options in AKI include haemodialysis and haemofi ltration (p306). Peritoneal
dialysis is rare for AKI in adults and in high-income countries but can be used.
Possible indications for renal replacement therapy:
• Fluid overload unresponsive to medical treatment.
• Severe/prolonged acidosis.
• Recurrent/persistent hyperkalaemia despite medical treatment.
• Uraemia eg pericarditis, encephalopathy (more common in CKD).
The decision to start RRT should be individualized, aiming to provide organ support
and prevent complications, rather than waiting for them to occur. The complexity
of AKI and variation in thresholds for starting RRT prevent robust meta-analysis.
Fluid overload is likely to be an important predictor of worse outcome.
Possible complications of RRT: Risks of dialysis catheter insertion and mainte-
nance, procedural hypotension, bleeding due to the requirement for anticoagula-
tion, altered nutrition and drug clearance.
2 Calcium chloride contains 3x calcium than the same volume of gluconate. Concern exists about the
bioavailability of calcium gluconate. Both salts carry a risk of tissue necrosis with extravasation.

The most common causes of CKD in the UK are diabetes (24%), glomerulonephritis
(13%), and BP/renovascular disease (11%).7
Prognosis GFR and albuminuria are independently associated with a higher risk of:
• all-cause mortality
• cardiovascular mortality
• progressive kidney disease and kidney failure
• AKI.
Patients with CKD are much more likely to die of CVD than to need renal replacement
therapy. The risk of adverse outcome in CKD can be represented as a ‘heat map’ ac-

The patient with CKD: a clinical approach
History
• Does the patient really have CKD? Does the eGFR refl ect the true GFR (p669)? Is
the eGFR corrected for ethnicity/drugs (eg trimethoprim alters creatinine con-
centration but not GFR)? Evidence of chronicity, ie >3 months—is there a previous
creatinine on record?
• Possible cause: Ask about previous UTI, lower urinary tract symptoms, PMH of
BP, DM, IHD, systemic disorder, renal colic. Check drug history including when
medications started. Family history including renal disease and subarachnoid
haemorrhage. Systems review: look out for more than is immediately obvious,
consider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive
of systemic disorder (‘When did you last feel well?’) and malignancy.
• Current state: Patients may have symptomatic CKD if GFR <30. Includes symp-
toms of fl uid overload (SOB, peripheral oedema), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, rest-
less legs, fatigue, weakness, pruritus, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence.
Examination
• Periphery: Peripheral oedema. Signs of peripheral vascular disease or neuropa-
thy. A vasculitic rash. Gouty tophi. Joint disease. Arteriovenous fi stula (thrill,
bruit, recently needling?). Signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids,
skin malignancy. Uraemic fl ap/encephalopathy if GFR <15.
• Face: Anaemia, xanthelasma, yellow tinge (uraemia), jaundice (hepatorenal),
gum hypertrophy (ciclosporin), Cushingoid (steroids), periorbital oedema (ne-
phrotic syndrome), taut skin/telangiectasia (scleroderma), facial lipodystrophy
(glomerulonephritis).
• Neck: JVP for fl uid state, tunnelled line (if removed, look for small scar over in-
ternal jugular, and a larger scar in ‘breast pocket’ area), scar from parathyroid-
ectomy, lymphadenopathy.
• Cardiovascular: BP, sternotomy, cardiomegaly, stigmata of endocarditis. If
right-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not refl ect fl uid state.
• Respiratory: Pulmonary oedema or eff usion.
• Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below
umbilicus and to side of midline), signs of previous transplant (scar, palpable
graft), ballotable polycystic kidneys ± palpable liver.
Investigation
• Blood: U&E (compare with previous), Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia),
glucose (DM), Ca2+, PO43 Ω, PTH (renal osteodystrophy). Directed investigation
of intrinsic renal disease: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, paraprotein,
complement, cryoglobulin, anti-GBM, hepatitis serology, anti-PLA2R (membranous
nephropathy). Note: ESR is not helpful as  in CKD and proteinuric states.
• Urine: Dipstick, MC&S, A:CR or P:CR (p294), Bence Jones.
• Imaging: USS for size, symmetry, anatomy, corticomedullary diff erentiation, and
to exclude obstruction. In CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in infi ltrative
disorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM. If asymmetrical consider renovas-
cular disease. Scarring may be seen on USS but isotope scans are more sensitive.
• Histology: Consider renal biopsy (p310) in progressive disease, nephrotic syn-
drome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treat-
ment if GFR stable and P:CR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need
biopsy unless atypical, ie nephrotic, haematuria, other systemic symptoms.
Monitoring renal function in CKD
GFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk. If
high risk, monitor every 6 months (fi g 7.5, orange), if very high risk, monitor at
least every 3–4 months (fi g 7.5, red). Small fl uctuations are common but a drop in
eGFR stage with eGFR ≥ 25% is signifi cant. Rapid progression is eGFR >5/yr.
Risk factors for decline: BP, DM, metabolic disturbance, volume depletion, infec-
tion, NSAIDs, smoking. All CKD has risk of superimposed AKI and needs monitoring
and prompt treatment during intercurrent illness.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD): management
CKD encompasses a range of disease from mild disease without progression to ad-
vanced, symptomatic disease requiring renal replacement.
Management of CKD6,8 requires:
1 Appropriate referral to nephrology.
2 Treatment to slow renal disease progression.
3 Treatment of renal complications ofC KD.
4 Treatment of other complications ofC KD.
5 Preparation for renal replacement therapy (dialysis/transplantation) (p306).
Referral to nephrology
Consider referral for:
• stage G4 and G5 CKD (table 7.5)
• moderate proteinuria A:CR >70mg/mmol unless due to DM and already treated
• proteinuria A:CR >30mg/mmol with haematuria
• declining eGFR:
• eGFR by ≥25% + GFR category (table 7.5)
• sustained eGFR ≥15% within 12 months
• BP poorly controlled despite ≥4 antihypertensive drugs at therapeutic dose
• known or suspected rare or genetic cause of CKD.
Treatment to slow renal disease progression
BP: Target systolic BP is <140mmHg (range 120–139mmHg) and diastolic <90mmHg.
If DM or A:CR >70 then systolic target is <130mmHg (range 120–129) and diastolic
<80mmHg.
Renin–angiotensin system: Off er treatment with a renin–angiotensin system an-
tagonist (ACE-i, ARB) to:
• DM and A:CR >3mg/mmol.
• Hypertension and A:CR >30mg/mmol.
• Any CKD with A:CR >70mg/mmol.
Do not combine renin–angiotensinsin antagonists due to risk of hyperkalaemia and
hypotension. Check K+ and renal function prior to, and 1–2 weeks after, starting treat-
ment or changing dose. Stop if K+ >6mmol/L, eGFR >25%, or creatinine >30%: ex-
clude other possible causes and consider a lower dose.
Glycaemic control: Target HbA1C of ~53mmol/mol (7.0%) unless risk of hypo-
glycaemia, comorbidity or limited life expectancy.
Lifestyle: Off er advice about exercise, healthy weight, and smoking cessation. Salt
intake should be reduced to <2g of sodium/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day).
Treatment of renal complications of CKD
Anaemia: Check Hb when eGFR <60. Investigate (especially if anaemic with eGFR >30)
and treat other defi ciencies: iron (hypochromic red cells >6%, transferrin saturation
<20%, ferritin <100), B12, and folate. Do not miss chronic blood loss. Iron therapy may
need to be given IV. Consider treatment with an erythropoietic stimulating agent
(ESA, ‘Epo’) if Hb <110g/L and likely to benefi t in terms of function and quality of
life. Pure red cell aplasia is a very rare, severe complication of ESA treatment due to
anti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60g/L: exclude more common
causes of anaemia fi rst.
Acidosis: Consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for patients with eGFR <30 and
low serum bicarbonate (<20mmol/L). Caution in patients with hypertension and
fl uid overload due to sodium component.
Oedema: Restrict fl uid and sodium intake. High doses of loop diuretics may be need-
ed. Combination of a loop and thiazide diuretic can have a powerful eff ect: distal
tubule sodium excretion (and its inhibition with a thiazide) is more signifi cant when
already treated with a loop diuretic (fi g 7.13). Diuretic treatment should only be given
with careful monitoring of fl uid state and renal function.

CKD bone-mineral disorders: CKD causes  in serum phosphate and reduced hy-
droxlyation of vitamin D by the kidney. Measure calcium, phosphate, ALP, PTH, and
25-OH vit D if eGFR <30.
• Treat if phosphate >1.5mmol/L (>1.7mmol/L if RRT) with dietary restriction ± phos-
phate binders. The use of binders which do not contain calcium may be benefi cial
in preventing vascular calcifi cation.
• Give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if defi cient. If PTH per-
sists or is increasing, treat with an activated vit D analogue eg 1-calcidol or calci-
triol. Paricalcitol suppresses PTH with less eff ect on gut absorption of calcium and
phosphate and is less likely to cause calcium/phosphate.
Restless legs/cramps: Exclude iron defi ciency as a possible exacerbating factor.
Give sleep hygiene advice. Treatment for severe cases with gabapentin/pregabalin/
dopamine agonists is off licence and may be complicated by side-eff ects (falls, cogni-
tive impairment, impulse-control disorder).
Diet: Expert dietary advice should be available regarding protein intake, K+ if hyper-
kalaemic, and phosphate restriction (eg dairy products).
Treatment of other complications of CKD
Cardiovascular disease: CKD confers risk of cardiovascular disease due to BP, vas-
cular stiff ness, infl ammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal endothelial function (CV
risk often higher than the risk of kidney failure).
• Antiplatelets (low-dose aspirin) for CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events unless
bleeding risk outweighs benefi t (mortality benefi t unclear in CKD).
• Atorvastatin 20mg (and higher if GFR >30) for primary and secondary prevention
of cardiovascular disease.
• CKD should not aff ect treatment for heart failure but monitoring of GFR and K+.
• GFR <60 may aff ect troponin and BNP values. Interpret results cautiously with con-
sideration for the GFR.
Preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT)
Planning for RRT should begin in progressive CKD when the risk of renal failure is
10–20% within a year. Referral to nephrology less than 1 year before RRT is required
is considered a late referral.
All suitable patients should be listed for a deceased donor transplantation
6 months before the anticipated start of RRT. All suitable patients should be informed
about the advantages of a pre-emptive living kidney transplant and eff orts made to
fi nd a donor (p308).
Prescribing in CKD
Never prescribe in renal failure before checking how administration should be
altered due to a GFR. This will be determined largely by the extent to which a
drug is renally excreted. This is signifi cant for aminoglycosides, penicillins,
cephalo sporins, heparin, lithium, opiates, and digoxin. Loading doses should not
be changed.
If precision is required for dosing (eg chemotherapy) then GFR should not be
estimated from creatinine: a cystatin C or direct measure of GFR should be used.
If the patient is receiving renal replacement (haemofi ltration, peritoneal or hae-
modialysis), dose modifi cation depends on the extent to which a drug is cleared
from the circulation by dialysis/fi ltration.
The best prescribing guide to consult is the Renal Drug Database/Handbook
(www.renaldrugdatabase.com), an invaluable resource detailing dose modifi cation in
renal failure and in renal replacement for almost any drug you could wish to use.
All hospitals should have access: speak to your pharmacist.

• inability to control volume status, including pulmonary oedema
• inability to control blood pressure
• serositis
• acid–base or electrolyte abnormalities
• pruritus
• nausea/vomiting/deterioration in nutritional status
• cognitive impairment.
RRT is a misnomer for dialysis: renal function is not replaced, rather there is provi-
sion of just enough clearance to ameliorate the symptoms of kidney failure.
GFR at commencement of dialysis is usually ~5–10. When transplantation is awaited
or not possible, there are two main options: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
Haemodialysis (HD) (fi g 7.6) Blood is Blood Blood

against dialysis fl uid fl owing in the oppo-
site direction. Diff usion of solutes occurs
down the concentration gradient. A hy-
drostatic gradient is used to clear excess Waste Dialysate Fluid
fl uid as required (ultrafi ltration). Access is removed in
preferentially via an arteriovenous fi stula
which provides blood fl ow and longevity. Fig 7.6 Haemodialysis.
This should be created prior to need for RRT
to avoid the infection risk associated with central venous dialysis catheters. HD is
needed 3 times/week or more. Daily HD increases the ‘dose’ and improves outcomes.
Home HD should be off ered to all suitable patients. Problems: Access (arteriovenous
fi stula: thrombosis, stenosis, steal syndrome; tunnelled venous line: infection, block-
age, recirculation of blood), dialysis dysequilibrium (between cerebral and blood sol-
utes leading to cerebral oedema  start HD gradually), hypotension, time consuming.
Peritoneal dialysis (PD) Uses the peritoneum as a semi-permeable membrane.
A catheter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity and fl uid infused. Solutes diff use
slowly across. Ultrafi ltration is achieved by adding osmotic agents (glucose, glu-
cose polymers) to the fl uid. It is a continuous process with intermittent drainage
and refi lling of the peritoneal cavity, performed at home. Problems: Catheter site
infection, PD peritonitis, hernia, loss of membrane function over time.

combination with HD (haemodiafi ltration)
for haemodynamic stability and middle molecule clearance, eg 2-microglobulin.
Complications of RRT Annual mortality is signifi cant, mostly due to cardiovascu-
lar disease: BP, calcium/phosphate dysregulation, vascular stiff ness, infl ammation,
oxidative stress, abnormal endothelial function. Protein-calorie malnutrition: In-
creases morbidity and mortality. Renal bone disease: High bone turnover, renal
osteodystrophy, osteitis fi brosa. Infection: Uraemia causes granulocyte and T-cell
dysfunction with sepsis-related mortality. Amyloid: 2-microglobulin accumulates
in long–term dialysis causing carpal tunnel syndrome, arthralgia, visceral eff ects.
Conservative management is for those who opt not to receive RRT due to lack of
benefi t on quality or quantity of life. Focus is on preserving residual renal function,
symptom control, and advanced planning with patient and family for end-of-life care.

When a patient on dialysis presents...
1 Do they need dialysis now? Examine for fl uid overload and check K+. If on PD
are they well enough to perform it themselves? Refer urgently to renal on-call.
2 When will they need dialysis? When are they due to dialyse next? Weigh them.
All patients on dialysis have a target weight at which they are considered
euvolaemic. How much are they above it? Do they have any useful urine output
(ie that may help them lose volume/K+)? Refer to renal in a timely manner.
3 What is your diagnosis? History and examination as for any other patient. Do
not measure BP on fi stula arm. Remember risk for CVD but troponin has
specifi city in ESRF.
4 Treat. Remember to dose adjust for renal failure—includes antibiotics, opi-
ates, insulin, and low-molecular-weight heparin (see www.renaldrugdatabase.com,
p305). Care with fl uid replacement in sepsis: be guided by clinical examination
and target weight. If unsure get expert help. If volume depleted give a 250mL
bolus of (non-K+ containing) crystalloid over 15min with close observation.
Avoid maintenance fl uids in those who normally have a fl uid restriction. Do
not use a dialysis line or fi stula for IV access—if a cannula is necessary,
preferentially use the back of the hand, save other vessels for future fi stulas.
5 Surgery needs senior anaesthetic and renal input. Aim for pre-op K+
<5.5mmol/L (<5.0mmol/L if major surgery with risk of tissue breakdown/
haemolysis). Check K+ urgently post-op (venous gas in recovery). In elective
surgery, plan dialysis provision pre- and post-op.
Warning: there is no normal
Ten years is a long time. For those ten years, or just over 3,560 times, I attached
myself to a peritoneal dialysis machine and underwent nine hours and fi fty min-
utes of nightly therapy. I subsequently learned to do a lot of crosswords and read
a ridiculous amount of books. In ten years I had just three incidents: an inguinal
hernia due to thinking that I could move a sofa (I could not), a parathyroidectomy
(my knees were much happier afterwards), and one unfortunate bout of peritoni-
tis (once was enough). Statistically speaking, I am an anomaly: the ‘average’ life
span of a peritoneal dialysis patient is four years.
Admittedly, I did not initially cope well with needing to be on dialysis. After hav-
ing lived successfully with a transplant, a return to dialysis felt like failure. I did not
want the hassle of treatment. I did not want piles of boxes cluttering up our home.
Mostly, I did not want a PD catheter jutting out of my belly. But what I originally
believed to be unacceptable, gradually became tolerable. This took time. It took
care and support. It took experiencing relative health, and seeing that dialysis life,
although diff erent to existing with a transplant, could be lived well.

The man in a red canoe who saved a million lives
Mostly we commute to work each day driven by motives we would rather not
look at too deeply. But one renal physician used a red canoe to commute each day
from his houseboat to the hospital. He could have been a very rich man but instead
Belding Scribner gave his invention away, and continued his modest existence.
He invented the Scribner shunt—a U of tefl on connecting an artery to a vein, al-
lowing haemodialysis to be something that could be repeated as often as needed.
Before Scribner, glass tubes had to be painfully inserted into blood vessels, which
would be damaged by the procedure so that haemodialysis could be done for
only a few cycles. Clyde Shields was his fi rst patient in 1960, and said that his fi rst
treatment ‘took so much of the waste I’d stored up out of me that it was just like
turning on the light from darkness’. Scribner took something that was 100% fatal
and turned it into a condition with a 90% survival.
On 19 June 2003, his canoe was found afl oat but empty. And like those ancient
Indian burial canoes found at Wiskam which have been polished to an unimagina-
ble lustre by the action of the shifting sands around the Island of the Dead, so we
polish and cherish the image of this man who gave everything away to help others.

Re nal replacement therapy (RRT): transplantation
Transplantation (fi gs 7.8, 7.9) should be considered for every patient with, or pro-
gressing towards, stage G5 kidney disease (p302). It is the treatment of choice for
kidney failure provided risks do not exceed benefi ts. Many will not make the trans-
plant list due to comorbidity or frailty.
Contraindications
• Absolute: cancer with metastases.
• Temporary: active infection, HIV with viral replication, unstable CVD.
• Relative: congestive heart failure, CVD.
Types of graft
• Living donor: Best graft function and survival, especially if HLA matched.
• Deceased donor: (See organ donation p13.)
1 Donor after brain death (DBD, heart-beating donor).
2 Expanded criteria donor (ECD) is from an older kidney or from a patient with a
history of CVA, BP, or CKD. This impacts on the long-term prognosis of the trans-
plant but off ers a better outcome than remaining on dialysis.
3 Donor after cardiac death (DCD, non-heart-beating donor) with risk of delayed
graft function.
Immunosuppression
A combination of drugs are used. Aim is to use the minimal eff ective dose with the
lowest drug-related toxicity. Protocol used depends upon the immunological risk of
the recipient and type of donated kidney.
Monoclonal antibodies: Eg basiliximab, daclizumab (selectively block activated
T cells via CD-25), alemtuzumab (T- and B-cell depletion). Used at the time of trans-
plantation (‘induction’). Acute rejection and graft loss, infection risk if non-selective.
Calcineurin inhibitors: Eg tacrolimus, ciclosporin. These drugs inhibit T-cell acti-
vation and proliferation. Inter-individual variation and narrow therapeutic index
mean drug level monitoring is required. Clearance is dependent on cytochrome p450
isoenzymes so beware of drug interactions including macrolide antibiotics and anti-
fungal drugs. Side eff ects: nephrotoxicity in the graft, modifi cation of CV risk factors:
BP, cholesterol, NODAT (new-onset diabetes after transplantation).
Antimetabolites: Eg mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine. MPA is now used pref-
erentially due to better prevention of acute rejection and graft survival (not in preg-
nancy, MPA is teratogenic). Side eff ects: anaemia, leucopenia, and GI toxicity.
Glucorticosteroids: Transcription of infl ammatory cytokines. First-choice treat-
ment for acute rejection. Signifi cant side-eff ects (BP, hyperlipidaemia, DM, impaired
wound healing, osteoporosis, cataracts, skin fragility) have led to protocols with ear-
ly withdrawal of steroids and the use of steroid-free immunosuppression regimens.
Complications
Surgical: Bleed, thrombosis, infection, urinary leaks, lymphocele, hernia.
Delayed graft function: Aff ects up to 40% of grafts, more common in DCD.
Rejection: Acute or chronic. Acute is divided into antibody mediated (rare un-
less known pre-sensitized recipient) or cellular (most common). Causes renal
function, diagnosed on graft biopsy. Treatment with high-dose steroids and
immunosuppression. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection causes progressive dys-
function of the graft. Most graft loss is now thought to be due to an immune re-
sponse by donor-specifi c antibodies causing damage to the kidney microcirculation.
Complex pathology and lack of controlled studies mean treatment is not clear. The
results of monoclonal antibody trials are awaited.
Infection: Risk of all infections. Typically hospital acquired/donor derived in month
1, opportunistic in months 1–6 (therefore prophylactic treatment for CMV and Pneu-
mocystis jirovecii given), usual spectrum of community-acquired infection after 6–12
months. Late viral infection should always be considered: eg CMV, HSV.
Malignancy: Up to 25≈ risk of cancer with immunosuppression, particularly skin,
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and gynaecological.
CVD: 3–5≈ risk of premature CVD compared to general population (but ~80% less than
dialysis). BP, NODAT, rejection, and renal history (uraemic cardiomyopathy) contribute.

Prognosis
Acute rejection <15%, 1-year graft survival >90%. Longer-term graft loss ~4%/year.
Factors contributing to graft loss:
• Donor factors: age, comorbidity, living/deceased, DBD/DCD.
• Rejection.
• Infection.
• BP/CVD.
• Recurrent renal disease in graft.
Most common outcome is death with a functioning transplant (ie transplant ‘out-
lives’ the patient).
When a patient with a renal transplant presents...
1 Discuss everything with the local renal transplant unit: they will be happy to
advise, review, transfer, and follow-up any renal transplant recipient.
2 What is the eGFR/creatinine? How does that compare with previous results? If
you do not have any, ask the transplant unit.
3 Examine for and treat any reversible cause of AKI. Fluid state assessment
(p300) is important—if you are unsure, get expert help. Correction of volume
depletion and treatment of any sepsis should be prompt.
4 Consider viral/opportunistic infections and atypical presentations due to im-
munosuppression, eg CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii.
5 Do not stop any immunosuppressive medication.If the patient is unable to
tolerate oral medication then immunosuppression must be given NG or convert
ed to an IV dose (conversion depends on drug: check with your pharmacist).
6 Check for medication interactions: macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin,
clarithromycin) can cause calcineurin inhibitor toxicity.
7 Dose all drugs according to renal function: penicillins, cephalosporins, amino-
glycosides, insulin, opiates, and low-molecular-weight heparin.
8 Check with the transplant unit before you give low-molecular-weight heparin
for VTE prophylaxis: they may want to do a transplant biopsy.
Thank you for life
It feels good to be able to put pen to paper at last and to thank you from the bot-
tom of my heart for the gift of life your daughter has given me and for the kindness
and compassion you have shown.... I want to say to you that it was a wonderful
thing that you did as a mother that in your deep sadness showed a caring and giv-
ing heart. I have a much better quality of life now since coming off dialysis 5 years
ago. My father died of kidney failure when I was 3 years old. He was someone I
would have loved to have known. I often think about your daughter, who she was
and what she was like. Despite not knowing her, I think about her with aff ection
and much respect. These last years must have been extremely painful for you all. I
really hope that you, your family and friends have found peace in your lives.
Love Deborah (renal transplant recipient, 1998)

Glomerulonephritis
The term glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses a number of conditions which:
• are caused by pathology in the glomerulus
• present with proteinuria, haematuria, or both
• are diagnosed on a renal biopsy
• cause CKD
• can progress to kidney failure (except minimal change disease).
The names of the diseases come from either the histological appearance (eg membra-
nous glomerulonephritis), or the associated systemic condition (eg lupus nephritis).
Nephrotic or nephritic?
The glomerulonephritides classically present on a spectrum ranging from nephro-
sis (proteinuria due to podocyte pathology, p312), to nephritis (haematuria due to
infl ammatory damage, p311). This is illustrated in fi g 7.10. However, if a GN causes
scarring, then proteinuria can occur. Proteinuria can therefore complicate the
longer-term clinical picture of any GN, including those that are classically ‘nephritic’.
Fig 7.10 The spectrum of glomerular disease ranging from proteinuria (nephrosis) to haematuria
(nephritis).

Investigation Assess damage and potential cause. Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP; immu-
noglobulins, electrophoresis, complement (C3, C4); autoantibodies (p553): ANA, ANCA,
anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM; blood culture, ASOT, hepatitis serology. Urine: MC&S, Bence Jones
protein, A:CR/P:CR (p294), RBC casts (p295). Imaging: CXR (pulmonary haemorrhage), renal
ultrasound (size and anatomy for biopsy). Renal biopsy: Required for diagnosis.
Renal biopsy
Pre-procedure: BP (<160/95 or according to local protocol), FBC (Hb>9, plt>100),
clotting (PT and APTT <1.2), G&S. Written informed consent including possible com-
plications: mild back/loin pain, visible haematuria (~5%, usually clears), bleeding,
need for transfusion (~1%), angiographic intervention (~ ≤ 0.5%). Stop anticoagu-
lants (aspirin 1 week, warfarin to PT <1.2, low-molecular-weight heparin 24h).
Post-procedure: Bed rest for a minimum of 4h. Monitor pulse, BP, symptoms, and
urine colour. Do not discharge home until macroscopic haematuria settled. Aspirin
or warfarin can be restarted the next day if procedure uncomplicated.
Result: Examination of glomerular lesions provides GN diagnosis. Includes: pro-
portion of glomeruli involved (focal vs diff use), how much of each glomerulus is
involved (segmental vs global), hypercellularity, sclerosis. Immunohistology for
deposits (Ig, light chains, complement). Electron microscopy for ultrastructure:
precise location of deposits, podocyte appearance. Also examines tubulointer-
stitium (atrophy, fi brosis, infl ammation) and any vessels.
Management General management as for CKD (pp304–5) including BP control and in-
hibition of renin-angiotensin axis. Specifi c treatment including immunosuppression de-
pends on histological diagnosis, disease severity, disease progression, and comorbidity.

Nephritic glomerulonephritis
Nephritic glomerulonephritides9 include:
IgA nephropathy
Commonest primary GN in high-income countries Presentation: Asymptomatic
non-visible haematuria, or episodic visible haematuria which may be ‘synpharyngitic’:
within 12–72h of infection. BP. Proteinuria usually <1g. Slow, indolent disease: 20–
50% progress to renal failure over 30yr. Worse prognosis in , BP, creatinine,
proteinuria. Diagnosis: Renal biopsy: IgA deposition in mesangium. Treatment:
ACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria and protect renal function. Corticosteroids and fi sh oil if
persistent proteinuria >1g despite 3–6 months of ACE-i/ARB and GFR >50.
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP)
Small vessel vasculitis and systemic variant of IgA nephropathy with IgA deposition
in skin/joints/gut in addition to kidney. Presentation: Purpuric rash on extensor sur-
faces (typically on the legs, p702), fl itting polyarthritis, abdominal pain (GI bleeding),
and nephritis. Diagnosis: Usually clinical. Confi rmed with positive IF for IgA and C3 in
skin. Renal biopsy is identical to IgA nephropathy. Treatment: Renal disease is man-
aged as IgA nephropathy. Steroids may be used for gut involvement.
Post-streptococcal GN
Occurs after a throat (~ 2 weeks) or skin (~3–6 weeks) infection. Streptococcal antigen
deposits in the glomerulus leading to immune complex formation and infl ammation.
Presentation: Varies from haematuria to acute nephritis: haematuria, oedema, BP
and oliguria. Diagnosis: Evidence of streptococcal infection: ASOT, anti-DNAse B.
Also C3. Treatment: Supportive, antibiotics to clear the nephritogenic bacteria.
Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease
Previously known as Goodpasture’s disease. Rare. Auto-antibodies to type IV colla-
gen which is present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes. Presenta-
tion: Renal disease (oliguria/anuria, haematuria, AKI, renal failure) and lung disease
(pulmonary haemorrhage in 50–90%  SOB, haemoptysis). Dialysis-dependence at
presentation and crescents on biopsy predict poor prognosis. Diagnosis: Anti-GBM
in circulation/kidney (fi g 7.11). Treatment: Plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and
cyclophosphamide.
Rapidly progressive GN
Any aggressive GN, rapidly progressing to renal failure over days or weeks. Causes
include small vessel/ANCA vasculitis (p314), lupus nephritis (p314), anti-GBM disease.
Other GNs may ‘transform’ to become rapidly progressive including IgA, membranous.
Diagnosis: Breaks in the GBM allow an infl ux of infl ammatory cells so that crescents
are seen on renal biopsy (may be referred to as crescentic GN) (fi g 7.12). Treatment:
Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Other treatments depend on aetiology eg
plasma exchange for anti-GBM/ANCA vasculitis, possible role for monoclonal antibodies
in lupus nephritis.

Nephrotic syndrome
If there is oedema, dipstick the urine to avoid missing renal disease.
Defi nition The nephrotic syndrome is a triad of:
• proteinuria >3g/24h (P:CR >300mg/mmol, A:CR >250mg/mmol, p294)
• hypoalbuminaemia (usually <30g/L, can be <10g/L)
• oedema.
Aetiology Primary renal disease or secondary to a systemic disorder.
• Primary renal disease: Minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy (may
be associated with underlying infl ammation/malignancy), focal segmental glo-
merulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative GN.
• Secondary causes: DM, lupus nephritis, myeloma, amyloid, pre-eclampsia.
Pathophysiology The fi ltration barrier of the kidney is formed by podocytes, the
glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and endothelial cells. Proteinuria results
from podocyte pathology: abnormal function in minimal change disease, immune-
mediated damage in membranous nephropathy, and podocyte injury/death in FSGS;
or pathology in the GBM/endothelial cell: membranoproliferative GN.
Presentation Generalized, pitting oedema, which can be rapid and severe. Look in
dependent areas (ankles if mobile, sacral pad/elbows if bed-bound) and areas of low
tissue resistance, eg periorbitally. History: Ask about systemic symptoms, eg joint,
skin. Consider malignancy and chronic infection. : CCF (JVP, pulmonary oedema),
liver disease (albumin).
Management
1 Reduce oedema
Fluid (1L/day) and salt restriction. Diuresis with loop diuretics, eg furosemide.
If gut oedema aff ects oral absorption of diuretics, give IV. Use daily weights to
guide. Aim 0.5–1kg weight loss per day to avoid intravascular volume depletion
and secondary AKI. Thiazide diuretics can be added if oedema remains resistant
to high-dose loop diuretics. Albumin infusion increases proteinuria and remains
controversial with no consistent evidence of benefi t.
2 Treat underlying cause
Adults need a renal biopsy (p310). This is technically more diffi cult when there
is gross oedema so diuresis may be required fi rst. Treatment known to induce
remission should be given, eg corticosteroids in minimal change disease. Look for
and treat any underlying systemic disease, infection, or malignancy.
In children, minimal change disease is the commonest aetiology and steroids
induce remission in the majority. Biopsy is therefore avoided in children unless
there is no response to steroids, or if clinical features suggest another cause:
age <1yr, family history, extrarenal disease (eg arthritis, rash, anaemia), renal
failure, haematuria.
3 Reduce proteinuria
ACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria (may not be needed in minimal change disease).
4 Complications
• Thromboembolism. Hypercoagulable due to clotting factors, anti-thrombin
III, and platelet abnormalities. Risk of VTE including DVT/PE (~10% adult pa-
tients) and renal vein thrombosis (loin pain, haematuria, LDH, AKI if bilateral).
Treat with heparin (may need to dose adjust low-molecular-weight heparin
if GFR) and warfarin. If low bleeding risk, consider prophylaxis when albumin
<20g/L.
• Infection. Urine losses of immunoglobulins and immune mediators lead to risk
of urinary, respiratory, and CNS infection. Infection also seen in areas of fl uid ac-
cumulation: cellulitis, peritonitis, empyema. Ensure pneumococcal vaccination
given. Risk of varicella with steroid treatment: post-exposure prophylaxis in
non-immune, do not give live vaccine if immunosuppressed.
• Hyperlipidaemia. Cholesterol (>10mmol/L), LDL, triglycerides, HDL. Thought
due to hepatic synthesis in response to oncotic pressure and defective lipid
breakdown. Abnormalities are proportional to proteinuria. The benefi ts of
statins in CKD are extrapolated to nephrotic syndrome where there is evidence.

Nephrotic glomerulonephritis
Nephrotic glomerulonephritides9 include:
Minimal change disease
~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Idiopathic (most) or in association with drugs
(NSAIDS, lithium) or paraneoplastic (haematological malignancy, usually Hodgkin’s
lymphoma). Does not cause renal failure (if progressive CKD consider missed FSGS).
Diagnosis: Light microscopy is normal (hence the name). Electron microscopy
shows eff acement of podocyte foot processes.
Treatment: Prednisolone 1mg/kg for 4–16 weeks. 75% of adults will respond, >50%
relapse. Frequent relapses are managed with  or longer-term immune suppres-
sion (cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors).
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
Commonest glomerulonephritis seen on renal biopsy. Primary (idiopathic) or
secondary (HIV, heroin, lithium, lymphoma, any cause of kidney mass/nephrons,
kidney scarring due to another glomerulonephritis). All at risk of progressive CKD
and kidney failure: proteinuria worsens prognosis. Disease will recur in 30–50%
of kidney transplants.
Diagnosis: Glomeruli have scarring of certain segments (ie focal sclerosis). May
miss early disease if <10 glomeruli in biopsy sample.
Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Corticosteroids only in
primary (idiopathic) disease: remission in ~25%, partial remission in up to 50%.
Calcineurin inhibitors may be considered second line. Plasma exchange and rituxi-
mab have been used for recurrence in transplants.
Membranous nephropathy
~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary to:
• malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological
• infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistosomiasis
• immunological disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s
• drugs: gold, penicillamine.
Indolent disease with spontaneous remission in ~25%.
Diagnosis: Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody in 70–80% of idiopathic dis-
ease. Diff usely thickened GBM due to subepithelial deposits (IgG4 dominant in idi-
opathic, other IgGs in secondary disease). ‘Spikes’ on silver stain.
Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Immunosuppression
(‘Ponticelli’ regimen: corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide/chlorambucil) only
in those at high risk of progression (proteinuria >4g without response to ACE-i/
ARB for 6 months, creatinine by 30% in 6–12 months but eGFR still >30). The role of
targeted immunosuppression in those positive for anti-phospholipase A2 receptor
antibodies remains unknown. In secondary disease proteinuria can remit with
treatment of the underlying cause.
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
~10% of adult nephrotic syndrome (higher in low- and middle-income countries
due to infection). Divided into:
• immune-complex associated: driven by increased or abnormal immune com-
plexes which deposit in the kidney and activate complement. An underlying
cause can be found in most adult cases, eg infection, cryoglobulinaemia, mono-
clonal gammopathy, autoimmunity
• C3 glomerulopathy: due to a genetic or acquired defect in the alternative comple-
ment pathway, eg C3 nephritic factor. Progressive kidney dysfunction is common.
Diagnosis: A proliferative glomerulonephritis with electron dense deposits. Im-
munoglobulin deposition distinguishes immune-complex-associated disease from
C3 glomerulopathy.
Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Underlying cause in im-
mune-complex disease. Trial of immunosuppression if no underlying cause found
and progressive decline in renal function. Treatments to block or modify C3 activa-
tion are awaited.

Renal manifestations of systemic disease
Diabetic nephropathy
DM nephropathy10 is the commonest cause of end-stage renal failure: ~30–40% of
patients requiring renal replacement. Predicted prevalence  by 25–40% over next
20 years. Hyperglycaemia leads to growth factors, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
activation, production of advanced glycosylation end-products, and oxidative stress.
Causes glomerular capillary pressure, podocyte damage, and endothelial dysfunc-
tion. Albuminuria is fi rst clinical sign. Later scarring (glomerulosclerosis), nodule
formation (Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesions), and fi brosis with progressive loss of renal
function. Coexisting BP accelerates the disease course.
Diagnosis: Microalbuminuria (‘moderately increased albuminuria’) = A:CR 3–30mg/
mmol (p294, 302). Regression at this level of disease is possible. Not detected on
standard dipstick  must send A:CR. Screen annually.
Treatment:
• Intensive DM control prevents microalbuminuria and reduces risk of progression
to macroalbuminuria (‘severely increased albuminuria’) = A:CR >30mg/mmol. HbA1C
of 53mmol/mol (7%) reduces the development of all microvascular complications.
However, less impact on CVD risk and hard renal outcomes including progression to
kidney failure. Consider risk of hypoglycaemia.
• BP <130/80. Use ACE-i or ARB for CV and renal protection above BP control. Can pre-
vent progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria to macroalbuminu-
ria in hypertensive DM. (Less clear benefi t in normotensive DM but recommended
if A:CR >30mg/mmol.) No head-to-head studies of ACE-i/ARB in DM but equivalence
outside DM. If cough with ACE-i switch to ARB. No benefi t to dual therapy and risk
of K+. Data on direct renin inhibitors (eg aliskiren) awaited.
• Sodium restriction to <2g/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day).
• Statins to reduce CV risk (p305). Unclear benefi t once on dialysis: do not initiate but
do not need to discontinue if tolerated.
Lupus nephritis
SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with antibodies against nuclear components,
eg double-stranded (ds)DNA. Deposition of antibody complexes causes infl ammation
and tissue damage. Presentation: Rash, photosensitivity, ulcers, arthritis, serositis,
CNS eff ects, cytopenias, and renal disease. Nephropathy is common (50% in fi rst year,
75% overall). Can present as nephritis (p310) or nephrosis (p312). Diagnosis: Clinical.
Antibody profi le: ANA is sensitive but not specifi c. Anti-dsDNA has a specifi city of 75–
100% and titres correlate with disease activity. Consider biopsy if A:CR >30, P:CR >50.
Treatment: Depends on histological class. Classes I and II show mild changes with
little risk of renal disease progression: ACE-i/ARB for renal protection and hydroxy-
chloroquine for extra-renal disease. Classes III-V require immunosuppression: my-
cophenolate, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.
Small vessel vasculitis
Multiple classifi cation systems exist. Clinical phenotype and ANCA subtype are im-
portant. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) occurs with or without specifi city for pro-
teinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). AAV classically presents at an older age
(>60yrs) and accounts for 20% of biopsy fi ndings >80yrs. Ask about lethargy, fever,
myalgia, anorexia (‘When did you last feel well?’). Ask about respiratory symptoms
and investigate for pulmonary haemorrhage. Diagnosis: Clinical + ANCA + biopsy:
rapidly progressive GN (p311) without immune deposits (‘pauci-immune’). Treatment:
High-dose glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Plasma exchange if
presents with renal failure or pulmonary haemorrhage.
Myeloma (See p368.)
Associated renal disease in up to 40%: tubular obstruction due to light chain casts
(‘myeloma kidney’); deposition of Ig/light chains in glomerulus (causes proteinuria);
hypercalcaemia; renal tract infection due to immunoparesis. Treatment: Adequate
hydration, bisphosphonates for hypercalcaemia (care if GFR <30), anti-myeloma
treatment including glucocorticoids. It remains unclear whether there is a benefi t
in removing light chains by either plasma exchange or large pore haemodialysis.

Amyloid
Pathological folding of proteins leads to extracellular accumulation and organ dys-
function including kidney disease. Classifi ed according to protein: light chains in
myeloma = AL amyloid; serum amyloid A in chronic infl ammation = AA amyloid; also
rare familial types. Diagnosis: Congo red staining on biopsy, SAP scan. Treatment:
Underlying condition. New therapies target amyloid production, aggregation, and
breakdown.
Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS)
Presents with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Hb <100g/L, LDH,
haptoglobin, fragments on blood fi lm), platelets and AKI due to thrombosis of the
glomerular capillaries (microangiopathy). In children, primarily associated with
haemorrhagic colitis due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) eg O157:H7. Atypi-
cal HUS caused by dysregulation/uncontrolled activation of complement = ~ 5% of
HUS. Can be precipitated by pregnancy. Diagnosis: Triad of haemolytic anaemia,
platelets, and AKI with haematuria/proteinuria. ?Evidence of STEC. Look for abnor-
malities in the complement pathway: levels of C3, C4, factors H and I, complement
mutation screen. Treatment: STEC-HUS: supportive. aHUS: plasma infusion/exchange,
eculizumab (anti-C5) in England via the national aHUS centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
Symptoms overlap with HUS (see previous paragraph). Pentad: microangiopathic
haemolytic anaemia, platelets, AKI , neurological symptoms (headache, palsies, sei-
zure, confusion, coma), and fever. Due to a congenital defi ciency of, or acquired anti-
bodies to, the ADAMTS13 protease which normally cleaves multimers of von Willebrand
factor (VWF). Large VWF multimers cause platelet aggregation and fi brin deposition
in small vessels, leading to a multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy. Diagnosis:
Clinical. ADAMTS13 activity. Treatment: TTP is a haematological emergency: get
expert help. Plasma infusion/exchange removes antibodies/replaces ADAMTS13 and
may be life-saving. Corticosteroids. Consider rituximab for non-responders/relapse.
Atherosclerotic renovascular disease
Part of a systemic atheromatous vascular disease including cardio-, cerebro-, and
peripheral vascular disease (ask about claudication, check foot pulses), BP, and
lipids. Leads to renin–angiotensin upregulation which causes treatment-resistant
BP and/or a deterioration in renal function on ACE-i/ARB. Acute decompensated heart
failure (no LV impairment on echo) with fl ash pulmonary oedema in up to 10%. Di-
agnosis: >1.5cm asymmetry in renal size (but sensitivity and specifi city). Doppler
studies of native kidneys not consistently accurate for diagnosis. CT or MR (avoids
contrast) angiography. Treatment: Modifi cation of CV risk factors: statin, aspirin,
antihypertensive treatment. Historically, ACE-i/ARB were considered contraindicated
due to concern about renin–dependent renal perfusion and deterioration in function
on ACE-i/ARB. However, mortality seen with ACE-i/ARB. eGFR by <25% ‘sacrifi ced’ for
longer-term renal and cardiac outcome. Large RCTs of medical treatment vs revascu-
larization have failed to show an advantage to revascularization  only considered in
fl ash pulmonary oedema, rapid/oligo-anuric renal failure.
Scleroderma renal crisis
Occurs in ~5% of systemic sclerosis. Risk with: diff use disease, anti-RNA polymerase
III antibodies and <2yr from diagnosis. Diagnosis: Accelerated hypertension (new
>150/85mmHg) and AKI (eGFR by >30%). Biopsy: collapsed glomeruli, onion-skin
thickening of arterioles. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB. IV vasodilators to vascular resistance
and for digital ischaemia. Care with -blockers as HR compensating for stroke
volume. May recover renal function after many months.
Sickle cell nephropathy
HbSS is associated with hyperfi ltration (lower than expected creatinine) and albumi-
nuria. Although up to 75% of young patients will have some degree of CKD, progres-
sion to renal failure is usually associated with another trigger, eg papillary necrosis,
infection. Diagnosis: Clinical. Biopsy only if looking for another diagnosis, eg AKI
without clinical cause, nephrotic syndrome. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB. Inconsistent data
re hydroxycarbamide and hyperfi ltration. Mortality on dialysis: aim to transplant.

(p240) (‘vaptan’) (p320)
Proximal tubule
Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~70%), bicarbonate, phosphate, amino acids, sugars, uric acid.
Pathology
Fanconi syndrome: Generalized impairment of proximal tubular function lead-
ing to glycosuria (in a non-diabetic), phosphaturia, uricosuria, aminoaciduria, and
tubular-proteinuria (negative dipstick but positive urine P:CR p294). Phosphaturia
leads to phosphate loss from bone, demineralization, and growth impairment.
Treatment: replace phosphate. Proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis (RTA):
Failure of bicarbonate reabsorption. Distal reabsorption intact so serum bicarbo-
nate usually ≥ 12mmol/L. Accompanied by Fanconi syndrome unless rare familial
cause. Aetiology: light chain disease, drugs (eg tenofovir), heavy metals. Diagnosis:
IV bicarbonate increases bicarbonate loss in urine and causes rapid rise in urine pH
to ~7.5. Treatment: bicarbonate and potassium replacement.
Diuretics
Osmotic diuretic (eg mannitol): Used to ICP and intra-ocular pressure. Freely
fi ltered but poorly reabsorbed, holding water by osmosis. Na+, K+, Ca2+, ClΩ, Mg2+,
HCOΩ may be aff ected. Risk of pulmonary oedema if oligo/anuric. Carbonic anhy-
3
drase inhibitor (eg acetazolamide): Used in altitude sickness, glaucoma. Meta-
bolic acidosis due to bicarbonate excretion. Risk of nephrocalcinosis.

Thick ascending loop of Henle
Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~10–30%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via electroneutral
Na+/K+/2ClΩ co-transporter.
Pathology
Bartter syndromes: Due to impaired salt transport in the thick ascending loop.
Sodium reabsorption increases further along the nephron in exchange for K+ and
H+  all cause a hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic, metabolic alkalosis. Usually pre-
sent in childhood. Divided into subtypes depending on transport molecule defect.
Type 1 mimics a loop diuretic. Elevated prostaglandin levels are also a feature.
Treatment is with salt replacement and the use of NSAIDs (after volume repletion).
Diuretics
Loop diuretics (eg furosemide, bumetanide): Block the Na+/K+/2ClΩ co-trans-
porter in the thick ascending loop of Henle, hence increase the solute load of the
fi ltrate and reduce water resorption. Increase excretion of water, Na+, ClΩ, phos-
phate, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, and H+. They are readily absorbed from the GI tract (unless it
is oedematous in which case IV may be needed) with peak concentration within
30–120min. Widely used in peripheral oedema (heart failure, ascites). They can
also be used to treat hypercalcaemia. Side eff ects include hypokalaemic metabolic
alkalosis, hypovolaemia, and ototoxicity.
Distal tubule
Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~5–10%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via NaCl co-
transporter.
Pathology
Gitelman syndrome: Loss of function of the NaCl co-transporter. Milder than Bar-
tter syndrome: usually presents in adolescence/adulthood with incidental fi nding
of electrolyte abnormalities. Mimics thiazide diuretic administration. Treat with
electrolyte supplementation.
Diuretics
Thiazide (eg bendrofl umethiazide) and thiazide-like diuretics (eg indapam-
ide, chlortalidone, metolazone): Inhibit the NaCl transporter  decrease NaCl
reabsorption and increase water loss. Used to treat BP (p140). Side eff ects: hy-
ponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. However, calcium excretion
is reduced (in contrast to loop diuretics)  can be used to treat recurrent kidney
stones in patients with hypercalciuria. Excretion of uric acid is reduced (care in
gout). Glucose intolerance can occur (mechanism may be related to hypokalae-
mia) so care in DM. Increase in LDL cholesterol is not signifi cant with chronic use at
low dose, especially in the context of benefi cial BP reduction.
Cortical collecting duct
Physiology
Acid–base and K+ homeostasis. Aldosterone acts to retain Na+and excrete K+.
Pathology
Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Failure of acid (H+) excretion. Primary
genetic disease or secondary to autoimmune disease (eg Sjögren’s syndrome, SLE),
toxins (eg lithium). Can cause, or be caused by, nephrocalcinosis (eg medullary
sponge kidney, sarcoid). Leads to bone demineralization, renal calculi. Hypoka-
laemia can be severe. Diagnosis: urine fails to acidify (pH >5.3) despite metabolic
acidosis. Treat with bicarbonate replacement and management of underlying dis-
ease. Type 4 RTA: Hyperkalaemia and acidosis due to (real or apparent) hypoaldo-
steronism, eg adrenal insuffi ciency, DM, ACE-i/ARB, K+-sparing diuretics.
Diuretics
K+-sparing: aldosterone antagonists, eg spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride.
Used in aldosteronism, heart failure, cirrhosis, K+-wasting states. Decrease Na+
and K+ excretion. Can cause K+, acidosis. Oestrogenic eff ects with spironolactone.

Tubulointerstitial nephropathy and nephrotoxins
The renal tubules and the interstitium make up ~80% of the kidney. Damage to one
is usually associated with damage to the other = tubulointerstitial nephropathy. Can
be acute or chronic.
Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN)
Presents with AKI. Eosinophilia in ~30%. An ‘allergic triad’ of fever, rash, and arthral-
gia occurs in ~10%. Should be considered in all cases of AKI for which there is no
obvious pre-renal or post-renal precipitant (p298). Biopsy shows an infl ammatory
cell infi ltrate in the interstitium ± tubule (‘tubulitis’). Prognosis improves with early
recognition although residual CKD in up to 40%. Aetiology:
• Drugs: antibiotics, NSAIDS, PPIS, diuretics, ranitidine, anticonvulsants, warfarin.
Take a full drug history including over-the-counter and herbal preparations.
• Infection: Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, E.
coli, Mycoplasma, CMV, EBV, HSV, hepatitis A-C.
• Autoimmune disease: SLE, sarcoid, Sjögren’s syndrome, ANCA.
Treatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Steroids are used de-
spite a paucity of RCT evidence.
Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN)
Insidious onset and slowly progressive renal impairment. Biopsy shows interstitial
fi brosis and tubular atrophy. Most commonly due to drugs (>70%) or infection. Pos-
sible causes include:
• drugs: NSAIDs (p319), lithium, calcineurin inhibitors, aminosalicylates (eg mesala-
zine, sulfasalazine), chemotherapy (eg cisplatin)
• infection: TB, pyelonephritis, leptospirosis, HIV
• immune disease: sarcoid, Sjögren’s syndrome
• specifi c nephrotoxins: lead, cadmium, mercury, aristolochic acid (p319)
• haematological disorders: myeloma
• genetic interstitial disease.
Treatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Reduce risk of progres-
sion as per CKD management: ACE-i/ARB, BP control, glucose, lipids (pp304–5). Future:
antifi brotic agents?
Nephrotoxins
Many agents may be toxic to the kidneys either by direct damage to the tubules, or
by causing an interstitial nephritis (see earlier in topic). Examples (not an exhaus-
tive list and idiosyncratic reactions are possible):
Analgesics: NSAIDS (p319).
Antimicrobials: Aminoglycosides (p319), sulfamethoxazole (in co-trimoxazole),
penicillins, rifampicin, amphotericin, aciclovir.
Anticonvulsants: Lamotrigine, valproate, phenytoin.
Other drugs: PPIS, cimetidine, furosemide, thiazides, ACE-i /ARB, lithium, iron, cal-
cineurin inhibitors, cisplatin.
Anaesthetic agents: Methoxyfl urane, enfl urane.
Radiocontrast material: (p319.)
Proteins: IgS in myeloma, light chain disease, Hb in haemolysis, myoglobin in rhab-
domyolysis (p319).
Crystals: Urate (p319).
Bacteria: Streptococci, Legionella, Brucella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, TB, Sal-
monella, Campylobacter, leptospirosis, syphilis.
Viruses: EBV, CMV, HIV, polyomavirus, adenovirus, measles.
Parasites: Toxoplasma, Leishmania.
Other: Ethylene glycol, radiation (p319), aristolochic acid (p319).

Analgesic nephropathy
Caused by NSAIDS, aspirin, paracetamol. Prevalence since phenacetin withdrawn.
Risk determined by frequency and duration of use. Presentation: History of chronic
pain (headache, musculoskeletal). Often silent until advanced CKD. Diagnosis: Uri-
nalysis: normal or sterile pyuria, mild proteinuria. USS: small and irregular kidneys.
IVU: classic ‘cup and spill’ appearance. Non-contrast CT: renal mass, papillary cal-
cifi cation. Biopsy: CTIN secondary to papillary necrosis. Risk of atherosclerosis.
Treatment: Discontinue analgesia. Manage CKD (pp304–5). USS or CT urogram if
sudden fl ank pain to exclude obstruction from sloughed papilla.
Aminoglycosides (gentamicin >tobramycin >amikacin >streptomycin)
Cause AKI due to tubular necrosis. Risk factors: dose, prolonged use, CKD, volume
depletion, other nephrotoxins. Presentation: Typically mild, non-oliguric AKI after
1–2 weeks of therapy. Recovery can be delayed/incomplete. Treatment: Prevention.
Single daily dose may be less nephrotoxic Check levels (p756).
Radiocontrast nephropathy
AKI 48–72 hours after IV contrast. Risk factors: CKD, DM, dose of contrast, volume
depletion, other nephrotoxins. Treatment: None. Prevention is key: pre-hydrate
with IV cystalloid (no consistent benefi t shown for bicarbonate above 0.9% sodium
chloride). Use local protocol or consider 3mL/kg/h 1 hour before, and 1mL/kg/h for
6h after. Acetylcysteine evidence is weak. Discontinue other nephrotoxic medication
for 24h pre- and post-procedure. Tell the radiologist about risk factors so they can
use the lowest dose of low/iso-osmolar contrast.
Rhabdomyolysis
Results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of intracellular contents (K+,
myoglobin) into the extracellular space. Cytokines and nitric oxide cause renal
vasoconstriction. Myoglobin is fi ltered by the glomeruli causing obstruction and
infl ammation. Presentation: History of trauma, surgery, immobility, hyperthermia,
seizures. Muscle pain, swelling, tenderness. AKI. Red-brown urine. Diagnosis: Serum
myoglobin: short half-life, may be missed. Plasma CK ≈5 upper limit. Myoglobinuria
(tea- or cola-coloured urine) is falsely +ve for blood on dipstick with no RBC seen on
microscopy. K+, PO43Ω, Ca2+. Treatment: Supportive. Urgent treatment for hyper-
kalaemia (p301). IV fl uid rehydration: maintain urine output 300mL/h until myoglobi-
nuria has ceased; up to 1.5L fl uid/h may be needed. If oliguric, monitor CVP in HDU/ICU
setting. Renal replacement may be needed. (Alkalinization of urine hypothesized to
crystallization and toxic metabolites but no RCT evidence to support use over other
crystalloids and beware Ca2+.)
Urate nephropathy
In acute crystal nephropathy, uric acid crystals precipitate within the tubulointer-
stitium causing GFR and secondary infl ammation. Seen in tumour lysis syndrome
when a high tumour burden and sensitivity to chemotherapy cause uric acid which
precipitates in association with phosphate. In addition, serum uric acid is a risk
factor for CKD: hypothesized stimulus for arterial disease with pathological autoregu-
lation of renal blood fl ow, renin, and BP. Treatment: Tumour lysis: aggressive hy-
dration, allopurinol/rasburicase to synthesis of uric acid. Chronic disease: unclear
whether diet/treatment to uric acid (allopurinol, febuxostat) improves outcome.
Radiation nephritis
Renal impairment due to ionizing radiation. Presents 6 months–years after total body
irradiation, local fi eld radiotherapy, or targeted radionucleotide therapy. Presents
with BP, proteinuria/haematuria, progression to renal failure. Prognosis linked to BP.
Treatment: Radiation dose with shielding. As CKD (pp304–5) with strict BP control.
Aristolochic acid nephropathy
Herbal remedies containing aristolochic acid can cause progressive CKD. Dispropor-
tionate anaemia, mild proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Biopsy: extensive fi brosis
and tubular atrophy. Risk of urothelial malignancy ≈5, occurs in up to 40%. Aris-
tolochic acid thought to be underlying cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy: clus-
ter of CKD/renal failure in Balkan areas where aristolochic acid is detected in wheat.
Treatment: Avoid exposure. Treat as CKD (pp304–5). Screen for malignancy. Consider
therapeutic trial of steroids (limited data).

Inherited kidney disease
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
1 in 400–1000 (~7 million worldwide). De novo mutation in ~10%. 2/3 will require
renal replacement. 85% have mutations in PKD1 (chromosome 16) and reach ESRF
by 50s. Mutation in PKD2 (chromosome 4) has a slower course, reaching ESRF by 70s.
Presentation: May be clinically silent unless cysts become symptomatic due to size/
haemorrhage (fi g 7.14). Loin pain, visible haematuria, cyst infection, renal calculi, BP,
progressive renal failure. Extrarenal: liver cysts, intracranial aneurysmSAH (p478),
mitral valve prolapse, ovarian cyst, diverticular disease. Diagnosis: USS is modality of
choice. Renal cysts are common and prevalence with age so diagnostic criteria are
age-specifi c: 15–39yrs ≥ 3 cysts, 40–59yrs >2 cysts in each kidney give a positive pre-
dictive value of 100% for both PKD1 and PKD2 mutations. Sensitivity is >93% for PKD1
but only 69% for diagnosis of PKD2 <30 years. Liver (90% by age 50) and pancreatic
cysts (~10%) support the diagnosis. Genetic testing available but ~1500 diff erent mu-
tations are described so use limited to diagnostic uncertainty, potential donors, and
pre-implantation diagnosis. (Non-contrast) CT for renal colic as cysts obscure view
on USS. Screening for intracranial aneurysms (MRI) recommended for age <65yrs if
personal/family history of aneurysm/SAH. Treatment: Water intake 3–4L/day (if eGFR
>30) may suppress cyst growth. BP should be treated to target <130/80mmHg: 1st-
line ACE-i/ARB, 2nd-line thiazide-like, 3rd-line -blocker (not calcium channel blocker
as Ca2+ entry is part of pathology although no specifi c outcome data). Treat infec-
tion. Haematuria usually managed conservatively. Persistent/severe pain may need
cyst decompression. Plan for RRT including pre-emptive transplantation. Ongoing re-
search evaluating drugs which inhibit cyst growth including vasopressin antagonists
(tolvaptan: decrease in kidney volume seen), somatostatin analogues, metformin,
and transcription inhibitors.
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
1 in 20 000, chromosome 6. Presents ante/perinatally with renal cysts (‘salt and pep-
per’ appearance on USS), congenital hepatic fi brosisportal hypertension. Poor prog-
nosis if neonatal respiratory distress. No specifi c therapy. (See OHCS p132.)
Renal phakomatoses
Tuberous sclerosis complex: 1 in 6000, autosomal dominant. Two genes: TSC1 (chro-
mosome 9) and TSC2 (chromosome 16). Multisystem disorder with hamartoma for-
mation in skin, brain (epilepsy), eye, heart, and lung (see OHCS p638). In kidney:
angiomyolipomata in 90% with risk of aneurysm and haemorrhage, cystic disease
in 50%. Replacement of renal tissue leads to kidney failure. mTORC1 inhibitors (eg
sirolimus, everolimus) block pathological cell signalling and reduce tumour volume.
Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome: 1 in 36 000, autosomal dominant (p712). Mutation in
VHL gene (chromosome 3) leads to uncontrolled activation of growth factors. Pheno-
type is a familial, multisystem cancer syndrome including renal cysts and clear cell
renal carcinoma at mean age 40s, ~70% risk by age 60 (VHL tumour-suppressor gene
is inactiva ted in most sporadic renal cell cancers). Manage by screening for tumours.
Possibility of future therapies which inhibit growth factor signalling.
Alport syndrome
1 in 5000. ~80–85% X-linked. Due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene, which encodes the
5 chain of type IV collagen. Haematuria, proteinuria, and progressive renal insuffi -
ciency. Average age of renal failure in men 30–40yrs. Female ‘carriers’ can exhibit the
phenotype, renal failure in ~30% by 60yrs. High-tone sensorineural hearing loss. An-
terior lenticonus: bulging of lens seen on slit-lamp examination (see OHCS p638). Type
IV collagen is the antigen in anti-GBM disease (p311) so there is a risk of anti-GBM dis-
ease following transplantation as the graft type IV collagen is recognized as ‘foreign’.
Fabry disease
1 in 40 000–120 000. X-linked. Lysosomal storage disorder due to a defi ciency of the
enzyme -galactosidase-A. Causes proteinuria and progressive renal failure in most
men and some female ‘carriers’. Lipid deposits are seen in urine and on renal biopsy
(‘zebra body’). Treatment with IV enzyme replacement can stabilize kidney function
if proteinuria controlled to <1g/24h.

Cystinuria
1 in 17 000. Autosomal recessive defect prevents reabsorption of cystine and dibasic
amino acids in proximal tubule. Leads to cystinuria and cystine stone formation.
Treatment: diet, fl uid intake, and urine alkalinization. Current drugs which increase
cystine solubility have adverse side-eff ect profi les.
Cystinosis
1 in 100 000–200 000. Autosomal recessive. Lysosomal storage disorder with accumula-
tion of cystine. In nephropathic forms causes proximal tubule dysfunction, Fanconi
syndrome (p316), and progressive renal impairment. Also visual impairment, myopathy,
hypothyroidism. Oral cysteamine intralysosomal cystine, and delays ESRF, but is poorly
tolerated (GI symptoms, skin deposits, fever, seizures).

The progressive increase in size can lead to abdominal discomfort. There may be
haemorrhage into a cyst causing haematuria, or infection.

A sense of humourism
Whilst our understanding of blood has changed emphatically with the advent
of medical research, its importance in health and disease is a common theme
throughout human history and culture. Hippocrates (460–370BC) fi rst described
the four bodily fl uids, or humours (Latin umor = body fl uid): blood, phlegm, and
yellow and black bile. This is not bile and phlegm as we know it; rather, it was
postulated by Fahråeus (1921, the Swedish physician who pioneered the ESR, p372)
that humourism arose from watching blood coagulate in vitro: distilling into layers
of bilious yellow serum fl oating on a scurf of white cells, with the dark red-black
clot of erythrocytes lurking in the depths of the sample.
These four humours were later elaborated by Roman physician, surgeon, and
philosopher Claudius Galen (c.129–c.201AD) who attributed physical and behav-
ioural traits to each humour: sanguine people are warm hearted and confi dent,
the phlegmatic practical and rational, those with a choleric nature are fi ery and
passionate, while the melancholic (melas=black, khole=bile) are depressed yet
creative.1 It was thought that an imbalance of any of these elements was the
source of disease, a belief which led to the wide-scale recommendation of the
removal of the excess bodily fl uid: expectoration, purging, and most popularly,
blood-letting. William Harvey, Sydenham, and Dupytren are among the famous
names who celebrated this cure, Harvey stating that ‘daily experience satisfi es
us that blood-letting has a most salutary eff ect in many diseases, and is indeed
the foremost among all the general remedial means’. Many tools were devel-
oped to aid this procedure, notably a collecting bowl with a convenient notch
for the antecubital fossa or neck: the predecessor of the modern kidney dish.
Such was the conviction of the healing brought about by bloodletting that
‘haematomania’ reigned despite a suspicious degree of mortality. Indeed, it may
have even killed inaugural US president George Washington in 1799: on develop-
ing laryngitis he was enthusiastically bled four times by his personal physician,
and died 24 hours after symptom onset.
Eventually, the credibility of this practice waned, and by 1860 it had virtually
disappeared. However, venesection still plays an important role in the manage-
ment of haemachromatosis (see p288) and polycythaemia rubra vera (p366).

Anaemia
Anaemia is defi ned as a low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and may be due either
to a low red cell mass or increased plasma volume (eg in pregnancy). A low Hb (at sea
level) is <135g/L for men and <115g/L for women. Anaemia may be due to reduced pro-
duction or increased loss of RBCS and has many causes. These will often be distinguish-
able by history, examination, and inspection of the blood fi lm (fi g 8.2, p323).
Symptoms Due to the underlying cause or to the anaemia itself: fatigue, dyspnoea,
faintness, palpitations, headache, tinnitus, anorexia—and angina if there is pre-exist-
ing coronary artery disease.
Signs May be absent even in severe anaemia. There may be pallor (eg of the con-
junctivae, see fi g 8.3, although this is not a reliable sign). In severe anaemia (Hb
<80g/L), there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation, eg tachycardia, fl ow
murmurs (ejection-systolic loudest over apex), and cardiac enlargement; or retinal
haemorrhages (rarely). Later, heart failure may occur: here, rapid blood transfusion
can be fatal.
Types of anaemia The fi rst step in diagnosis is to look at the mean cell volume
(MCV). Normal MCV is 76–96 femtolitres (1015 fL = 1L).
Low MCV (microcytic anaemia):
1 Iron-defi ciency anaemia (IDA), the most common cause: see p326.
2 Thalassaemia (suspect if the MCV is ‘too low’ for the Hb level and the red cell
count is raised, though defi nitive diagnosis needs DNA analysis): see p342.
3 Sideroblastic anaemia (very rare): p326.
NB: there is iron accumulation in the last two conditions, and so tests will show in-
creased serum iron and ferritin with a low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).
Normal MCV (normocytic anaemia):
1 Acute blood loss. 5 Hypothyroidism (or MCV).
2 Anaemia of chronic disease (or MCV). 6 Haemolysis (or MCV).
3 Bone marrow failure. 7 Pregnancy.
4 Renal failure.
NB: if wcc or platelet in normocytic anaemia, suspect marrow failure: see p364.
High MCV (macrocytic anaemia):
1 B12 or folate defi ciency. 5 Myelodysplastic syndromes.
2 Alcohol excess—or liver disease. 6 Marrow infi ltration.
3 Reticulocytosis (p328, eg with haemolysis). 7 Hypothyroidism.
4 Cytotoxics, eg hydroxycarbamide. 8 Antifolate drugs (eg phenytoin).
Haemolytic anaemias: These do not fi t into the above-mentioned classifi cation
as the anaemia may be normocytic or, if there are many young (hence larger) RBCS
and reticulocytes, macrocytic (p332). Suspect if there is a reticulo cytosis (>2% of
RBCS; or reticu locyte count >100≈109/L), mild macroc ytosis, haptoglobin, bilirubin,
LDH, or urobilinogen. These patients will often be mildly jaundiced (but note that
haemolysis causes pre-hepatic jaundice so there will be no bilirubin in their urine).
Does the patient need a blood transfusion? Probably not if Hb >70g/L. Chronic
anaemia in particular can be well-tolerated (though it is crucial to ascertain the
cause), and in IDA iron supplements will raise the Hb more safely and cost-eff ec-
tively. In acute anaemia (eg haemorrhage with active peptic ulcer), transfusion for
those with Hb <70g/L may be indicated. Other factors to consider include comor-
bidities (particularly IHD) and whether the patient is symptomatic.
In severe anaemia with heart failure, transfusion is vital to restore Hb to a safe
level, eg 60–80g/L, but this must be done with great care. Give it slowly with 10–
4 0mg furosemide IV/PO with alternate units (dose depends on previous exposure
to diuretics; do not mix with blood). Check for signs of worsening overload: rising
JVP and basal crackles: in this eventuality, stop and treat.

Fig 8.3 ‘Conjunctival pallor’, the classic sign of anaemia, is a confusing term as
the conjunctiva is translucent, trans mitting the colour of structures under it. The
‘pallor’ refers to the vasculature on the inner surface of the lid which is lacking
Hb. It is this colour but it should be:
Red cell distribution width (RCDW or RDW)
In health or in unifactorial anaemia, all the red cells in a sample are about the same
size, and the graph of their volume distribution forms a narrow peak. In mixed
anaemias, however, this peak broadens, refl ecting an abnormally large RDW—this
may be the fi rst clue to dual pathology. In coeliac disease, for example, poor ab-
sorption of iron (MCV) and folate (MCV) may occur simultaneously, resulting in a
combination of microcytes and macrocytes in the circulation. The visual analogue
of this is anisocytosis (p328) on a blood fi lm. The laboratory measure is a RDW,
where RDW = the standard deviation of MCV divided by the mean MCV, multiplied
by 100. Reference interval: 11 . 5–14 . 6%. If the MCV is high and the RDW is normal, the
cause is likely to be alcohol, liver disease, or a marrow problem (chemotherapy or
aplastic anaemia).

Iron-defi ciency anaemia (IDA)
This is common (seen in up to 14% of menstruating women).
Causes •Blood loss, eg menorrhagia or GI bleeding2 (upper p256; lower p629).
• Poor diet or poverty may cause IDA in babies or children (but rarely in adults).
• Malabsorption (eg coeliac disease) is a cause of refractory IDA.
• In the tropics, hookworm (GI blood loss) is the most common cause.
Signs Chronic IDA (signs now rare): koilonychia (fi g 8.4 and p76), atrophic glossitis,
angular cheilosis (fi g 8.5), and, rarely, post-cricoid webs (Plummer–Vinson syndrome).
Tests Blood fi lm: microcytic, hypochromic anaemia with anisocytosis and poikilo-
cytosis (fi gs 8.6, 8.7). MCV, MCH, and MCHC. Confi rmed by ferritin (also serum
iron with TIBC, but these are less reliable, see table 8.1). NB: ferritin is an acute
phase protein and  with infl ammation, eg infection, malignancy. Transferrin
is also  in IDA but is less aff ected by infl ammation. Check coeliac serology in all
(p266): if negative then refer all males and females who are not menstruating for
urgent gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Consider stool microscopy for ova if relevant
travel history. Faecal occult blood is not recommended as sensitivity is poor. IDA
with no obvious source of bleeding mandates careful GI workup.2
Treatment Treat the cause. Oral iron, eg ferrous sulfate 200mg/8h PO. SE: nausea, ab-
dominal discomfort, diarrhoea or constipation, black stools. Hb should rise by 10g/L/
week, with a modest reticulocytosis (young RBC, p328). Continue for at least 3 months
after Hb normalizes to replenish stores. IV iron is only indicated if the oral route is
impossible or ineff ective, eg functional iron defi ciency in chronic renal failure, where
there is inadequate mobilization of iron stores in response to erythropoietin therapy.
The usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient
has rejected the pills—check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI distur-
bance? Altering the dose of elemental iron with a diff erent preparation may help.
Alternatively, there may be continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chron-
ic disease; or misdiagnosis, eg when thalassaemia is to blame.
Anaemia of chronic disease (secondary anaemia)
The commonest anaemia in hospital patients (and the 2nd commonest, after IDA,
worldwide). It arises from three problems (in which the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays
a key role): 1 Poor use of iron in erythropoiesis. 2 Cytok ine-induced shortening of RBC
survival. 3 Production of and response to erythropoietin.
Causes Many, eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure.
Tests Ferritin normal or  in mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia (eg Hb >80g/L;
see table 8.1). Check blood fi lm, B12, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis (p336).
Treatment Treating the underlying disease may help (eg in 60% of patients with
RA), as may erythropoietin (SE: fl u-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the
platelet count and thromboembolism). Also eff ective in improving quality of life
in malignant disease. IV iron can safely overcome the functional iron defi ciency.
Hepcidin inhibitors and infl ammatory modulators show promise.
Sideroblastic anaemia
Microcytic anaemia does not always mean iron defi ciency! 20% of older people with
an MCV <75fL are not iron defi cient. Think of sideroblastic anaemia whenever
microcytic anaemia is not responding to iron. This condition is characterized by
ineff ective erythropoiesis, leading to iron absorption, iron loading in marrow ± hae-
mosiderosis (endocrine, liver, and heart damage due to iron deposition).
Causes Congenital (rare, x-linked) or acquir ed, eg idiopathic as one of the myelo-
dysplastic/myeloprolife rative diseases, can also follow chemotherapy, anti-TB drugs,
irradiation, alcohol or lead excess. Tests Look for ferritin, a hypo chromic blood fi lm,
and disease-defi ning sideroblasts in the marrow (fi gs 8.8, 8.9; table 8.1). Treatment
Remove the cause. Pyridoxine ± repeated transfusions for severe anaemia.
2 In one study, 11% presenting to their GP with IDA had GI carcinoma. Plan both upper and lower GI investiga-
tion: there may be abnormalities on both.

The peripheral blood fi lm
Many haematological (and other) diagnoses are made by careful examination of
the peripheral blood fi lm. It is also necessary for interpretation of the FBC indices.
Features Include:
Acanthocytes: (fi g 8.10) Spicules on RBCS ( unstable RBC membrane lipid structure);
causes: splenectomy, alcoholic liver disease, abetalipoproteinaemia, spherocytosis.
Anisocytosis: Variation in RBC size, eg megaloblastic anaemia, thalassaemia, IDA.
Basophilic RBC stippling: (fi g 8.11) Denatured RNA found in RBCS, indicating acceler-
ated erythropoiesis or defective Hb synthesis. Seen in lead poisoning, megaloblastic
anaemia, myelodysplasia, liver disease, haemoglobinopathy, eg thalassaemia.
Blasts: Nucleated precursor cells. They should not normally appear in peripheral
blood but do in myelofi brosis, leukaemia, and malignant marrow infi ltration.
Burr cells (echinocytes): RBC projections (less marked than in acanthocytes); fi g 8.12.
Cabot rings: Seen in: pernicious anaemia; lead poisoning; bad infections (fi g 8.13).1
Dimorphic picture: Two populations of red cells. Seen after treatment of Fe, B12,
or folate defi ciency, in mixed defi ciency (Fe with B12 or folate), post-transfusion,
or with primary sideroblastic anaemia, where a clone of abnormal erythroblasts
produce abnormal red cells, alongside normal red cell production.
Howell–Jolly bodies: DNA nuclear remnants in RBCS, which are normally removed
by the spleen (fi g 8.14). Seen post-splenectomy and in hyposplenism (eg sickle-cell
disease, coeliac disease, congenital, UC/Crohn’s, myeloproliferative disease, amyloid).
Also in dyserythropoietic states: myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anaemia.
Hypochromia: (p326.) Less dense staining of RBCS due to Hb synthesis, seen in IDA,
thalassaemia, and sideroblastic anaemia (iron stores unusable, p366).
Left shift: Immature neutrophils released from the marrow, eg in infection (fi g 8.15).
Leukoerythroblastic fi lm: Immature cells (myelocytes, promyelocytes, metamyelo-
cytes, normoblasts) ± tear-drop RBCS from haemolysis or marrow infi ltration/infec-
tion (maligna ncy; TB; brucella; visceral leishmaniasis; parvovirus B19) .
Leukaemoid reaction: A marked leucocytosis (WCC >50≈109/L). Seen in severe illness,
eg with infection or burns, and also in leukaemia.
Pappenheimer bodies: (fi g 8.16) Granules of siderocytes containing iron. Seen in
lead poisoning, carcinomatosis, and post-splenectomy.
Poikilocytosis: Variation in RBC shape, eg in IDA, myelofi brosis, thalassaemia.
Polychromasia: RBCS of diff erent ages stain unevenly (young are bluer). This is a re-
sponse to bleeding, haematinic replacement (ferrous sulfate, B12, folate), haemolysis,
or marrow infi ltration. Reticulocyte count is raised.
Reticulocytes: (Normal range: 0.8–2%; or <85≈109/L.) (fi g 8.17) Young, larger RBCS
(contain RNA) signifying active erythropoiesis. Increased in haemolysis, haemor-
rhage, and if B12, iron, or folate is given to marrow that lack these.
Right shift: Hypermature white cells: hypersegmented polymorphs (>5 lobes to nu-
cleus) seen in megaloblastic anaemia, uraemia, and liver disease. See p333, fi g 8.25.
Rouleaux formation: (fi g 8.18) Red cells stack on each other (causing a raised ESR;
p372). Seen with chronic infl ammation, paraproteinaemia, and myeloma.
Schisto cytes: Fragmented RBCS sliced by fi brin bands, in intravascular haemolysis
(p339, fi g 8.31). Look for microangiopathic anaemia, eg DIC (p352), haemolytic urae-
mic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP: p315), or pre-eclampsia.
Spherocytes: Spherical cells found in hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia. See p338.
Target cells: (Also known as Mexican hat cells, fi g 8.14 and fi g 8.41, p343.) These are
RBCS with central staining, a ring of pallor, and an outer rim of staining seen in liver
disease, hyposplenism, thalassaemia—and, in small numbers, in IDA.
Tear-drop RBCS: Seen in extramedullary haematopoiesis; see leukoerythroblastic fi lm.
3 Cabot ‘fi gure-of-eight’ rings may be micro tubules from mitotic spindles. It is easy to confuse them with
malaria parasites, p416 (especially if stippling gives a ‘chromatin dot’ artefact, as here). Richard Clarke
Cabot (1868–1939) liked diagnostic challenges: he founded the notoriously hard but beautifully presented
weekly clinicopathological exercises of the Massachusetts General Hospital which made the New England
Journal of Medicine so famous. He also wisely recommended that: ‘before you tell the truth to the patient,
be sure you know the truth, and that the patient wants to hear it’.

The diff erential white cell count
Neutrophils (fi gs 8.19, 8.20) 2–7.5 ≈ 109/L (40–75% of white blood cells: but absolute
values are more meaningful than percentages).
Increased in (ie neutrophilia):
• Bacterial infections.
• Infl ammation, eg myocardial infarction, polyarteritis nodosa.
• Myeloproliferative disorders.
• Drugs (steroids).
• Disseminated malignancy.
• Stress, eg trauma, surgery, burns, haemorrhage, seizure.
Decreased in (ie neutropenia—see p352):
• Viral infections.
• Drugs: post-chemotherapy, cytotoxic agents, carbimazole, sulfonamides.
• Severe sepsis.
• Neutrophil antibodies (SLE, haemolytic anaemia)—destruction.
• Hypersplenism (p373), eg Felty’s syndrome (p698).
• Bone marrow failure—production (p364).
Other neutrophil responses to infection: These include: • vacuoles in the cytoplasm
(the most specifi c sign of bacterial infection); • Döhle bodies: inconspicuous grey-blue
areas of cytoplasm (residual ribosomes). Up to 17% of neutrophils from females show
a drumstick-shaped Barr body (arrow, fi g 8.20d). It is the inactivated X chromosome.
Lymphocytes (fi g 8.21) 1 . 5–4 . 5 ≈ 109/L (20–45%).
Increased in (ie lymphocytosis):
• Acute viral infections.
• Chronic infections, eg TB, brucellosis, hepatitis, syphilis.
• Leukaemias and lymphomas, especially chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).
Large numbers of abnormal (‘atypical’) lymphocytes are characteristically seen with
EBV infection: these are T cells reacting against EBV-infected B cells. They have a large
amount of clearish cytoplasm with a blue rim that fl ows around neighbouring RBCS.
Other causes of ‘atypical’ lymphocytes: see p405.
Decreased in (ie lymphopenia):
• Steroid therapy; SLE; uraemia; Legionnaire’s disease; HIV infection; marrow infi l-
tration; post chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
T-lymphocyte subset reference values: CD4 count: 537–1571/mm3 (low in HIV infection).
CD8 count: 235–753/mm3; CD4/CD8 ratio: 1 . 2–3 . 8.
Eosinophils (fi g 8.22) 0.04–0.4 ≈ 109/L (1–6%).
Increased in (ie eosinophilia):
• Drug reactions, eg with erythema multiforme, p562.
• Allergies: asthma, atopy.
• Parasitic infections (especially invasive helminths).
• Skin disease: especially pemphigus, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis.
Also seen in malignant disease (including lymphomas and eosinophilic leukaemia),
PAN, adrenal insuffi ciency, irradiation, Löffl er’s syndrome (p704), Churg–Strauss sym-
drome (p696) and during the convalescent phase of any infection.
The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) occurs when eosinophila >1 . 5 ≈ 109/L is sustained
for >6 weeks leading to end-organ damage (endomyocardial fi brosis and restrictive
cardiomyopathy, skin lesions, thromboe mbolic disease, lung disease, neuropathy, and
hepatosplenom egaly). The cause is often unknown, though if FIP1L1-PDFRA genotype, dia-
g nose myeloprolife rative HES or eosinophilic leukaemia. : PO steroids ± mepoliz umab
(anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody). Imatinib is 1st choice for myoproliferative HES.
Monocytes (fi g 8.23) 0 . 2–0 . 8 ≈ 109/L (2–10%). Increased in (ie monocytosis): the
aftermath of chemo- or radiotherapy, chronic infections (eg malaria, TB, brucellosis,
protozoa), malignant disease (including M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukaemia (p356),
and Hodgkin’s disease), myelodysplasia.
Basophils (fi g 8.24) 0–0 . 1 ≈ 109/L (0–1%). Increased in (ie basophilia): myeloprolif-
erative disease, viral infections, IGE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (eg urticaria,
hypo thyroid ism), and infl ammatory disorders (eg UC, rheumatoid arthritis).

delayed compared with the cytoplasm. This occurs with B12 (p334) and folate de-
fi ciency: both are required for DNA synthesis. Another cause is cytotoxic drugs.
• Non-megaloblastic: Alcohol excess, reticulocytosis (eg in haemolysis), liver dis-
ease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy.
• Other haematological disease: Myelodysplasia (fi g 8.26), myeloma, myeloprolif-
erative disorders, aplastic anaemia.
Tests B12 and folate defi ciency result in similar blood fi lm and bone marrow biopsy
appearances.
Blood fi lm: Hypersegmented neutrophils (fi g 8.25) in B12 and folate defi ciency. Target
cells if liver disease; see fi g 8.14, p329 and fi g 8.41, p343.
Other tests: LFT (include GT), TFT, serum B12, and serum folate (or red cell folate—a
more reliable indicator of folate status, as serum folate only refl ects recent intake).
Bone marrow biopsy is indicated if the cause is not revealed by the above tests. It
is likely to show one of the following four states:
1 Megaloblastic marrow.
2 Normoblastic marrow (eg in liver disease, hypothyroidism).
3 Abnormal erythropoiesis (eg sideroblastic anaemia, p326, leukaemia, aplasia).
4 Increased erythropoiesis (eg haemolysis).
Folate Found in green vegetables, nuts, yeast, and liver; it is synthesized by gut
bact eria. Body stores can last for 4 months. Maternal folate defi ciency causes fe-
tal neural tube defects. It is absorbed by duodenum/proximal jejunum.
Causes of defi ciency:
• Poor diet, eg poverty, alcoholics, elderly.
• Increased demand, eg pregnancy or cell turnover (seen in haemolysis, malig-
nancy, infl ammatory disease, and renal dialysis).
• Malabsorption, eg coeliac disease, tropical sprue.
• Alcohol.
• Drugs: anti-epileptics (phenytoin, valproate), methotrexate, trimethoprim.
Treatment: Assess for an underlying cause, eg poor diet, malabsorption. Treat
with folic acid 5mg/day PO for 4 months, never without B12 unless the patient is
known to have a normal B12 level, as in low B12 states it may precipitate, or worsen,
subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334). In pregnancy, prophy lactic
doses of folate (400mcg/day) are given from conception until at least 12wks; this
helps prevent spina bifi da, as well as anaemia.
NB: in unwell patients (eg CCF) with megaloblastic anaemia, it may be necessary to
treat before serum B12 and folate results are known. Do tests then treat with large
doses of hydroxocobalamin, eg 1mg/48h IM—see BNF, with folic acid 5mg/24h PO.
Blood transfusions are very rarely needed (see p324).

defi ciency and pernicious anaemia
Vitamin B12 defi ciency is common, occurring in up to 15% of older people. B12 helps
synthesize thymidine, and hence DNA, so in defi ciency RBC production is slow.
Untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (p332) and irreversible CNS compli-
cations.  Body stores of B12 are suffi cient for 4yrs.
Causes of defi ciency • Dietary (eg vegans: B12 is found in meat, fi sh, and dairy
products, but not in plants). • Malabs orption: during digestion, intrinsic factor (IF)
in the stomach binds B12, enabling it to be absorbed in the terminal ileum. Malab-
sorption can therefore arise in the stomach due to lack of IF (pernicious anaemia,
post gastrectomy) or the terminal ileum (ileal resection, Crohn’s disease, bacterial
overgrowth, tropical sprue, tapeworms). • Congenital metabolic errors.
Features General: Symptoms of anaemia (p324), ‘lemon tinge’ to skin due to
combination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis
(beefy-red sore tongue; fi g 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326).
Neuropsychiatric: Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia.
Neurological: Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy. Also subacute combined
degeneration of the spinal cord, a combination of peripheral sensory neuropa-
thy with both upper and lower motor neuron signs due to B12. The patient may
display the classical triad of: • extensor plantars (UMN) • absent knee jerks (LMN)
• absent ankle jerks (LMN). The onset is insidious (subacute) and signs are symmet-
rical. There is a combination of poste rior (dorsal) column loss, causing the sensory
and LMN signs, and corticospinal tract loss, causing the motor and UMN signs (p446).
The spinothalamic tracts are preserved so pain and temperature sensation may
remain intact even in severe cases. Joint-position and vibration sense are often
aff ected fi rst leading to ataxia, followed by stiff ness and weakness if untreated.
The neurological signs of B12 defi ciency can occur without anaemia.
Pernicious anaemia (PA) This is an autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis
leads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 there-
fore remains unbound and conseqeuently cannot be absorbed by the terminal ileum.
Incidence: 1:1000; :≈1.6:1; usually >40yrs; higher incidence if blood group A.
Associations: Other autoimmune diseases (p553): thyroid disease (~25%), vitiligo,
Addison’s disease, hypoparathyroidism. Carcinoma of stomach is ~3-fold more
common in pernicious anaemia, so have a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy.
Tests: • Hb. • MCV. • WCC and platelets if severe. • Serum B124. • Reticulocytes may
be  as production impaired. • Hypersegmented neutrophils (p332). • Megaloblasts in
the marrow. • Specifi c tests for PA: 1 Parietal cell antibodies: found in 90% with PA,
but also in 3–10% without. 2 IF antibodies: specifi c for PA, but lower sensitivity.
Treatment: Treat the cause if possible. If due to malabsorption, give hydroxoco-
balamin (B12) 1mg IM alternate days for 2wks (or, if CNS signs, until improvement
stops), then 1mg IM every 3 months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12
can be given after the initial IM course (50–150mcg/daily, between meals). Im-
provement is indicated by a transient marked reticulocytosis (MCV), after 4–5 days.
Practical hints: • Beware of diagnosing PA in those under 40yrs old: look for GI ma-
labsorption (small bowel biopsy, p266).
• Watch for hypokalaemia due to uptake into new haematopoietic cells.
• Transfusion is best avoided, but PA with high-output CCF may require transfusion,
after doing tests for FBC, folate, B12, and marrow sampling.
• As haematopoiesis accelerates on treatment, additional iron may be needed.
• Hb rises ~10g/L per week; WCC and platelet count should normalize in 1wk.
Prognosis: Supplementation usually improves peripheral neuropathy within the
fi rst 3–6 months, but has little eff ect on cord signs. Patients do best if treated as
soon as possible after the onset of symptoms: don’t delay!
4 Serum B12 levels are normal in many patients with subclinical B12 defi ciency. Measuring homocysteine or
methylmalonic acid ( if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests.

An approach to haemolytic anaemia
Haemolysis is the premature breakdown of RBCS, before their normal lifespan of
~120d. It occurs in the circulation (intravascular) or in the reticuloendothelial sys-
tem, ie macrophages of liver, spleen, and bone marrow (extravascular). In sickle-cell
anaemia, lifespan may be as short as 5d. Haemolysis may be asymptomatic, but if
the bone marrow does not compensate suffi ciently, a haemolytic anaemia results.
An approach is fi rst to confi rm haemolysis and then fi nd the cause—try to
answer these four questions:
1 Is there increased red cell breakdown?
• Anaemia with normal or MCV.
• Bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice).
• Urinary urobilinogen (no urinary conjugated bilirubin).
• Serum LDH, as it is released from red cells.
2 Is there increased red cell production?
• Reticulocytes, causing MCV (reticulocytes are large immature RBCS) and poly-
chromasia.
3 Is the haemolysis mainly extra- or intravascular?
Extravascular haemolysis may lead to splenic hypertrophy and splenomegaly.
Features of intravascular haemolysis are:
• Free plasma haemoglobin: released from RBCS.
• Methaemalbuminaemia: some free Hb is broken down in the circulation to pro-
duce haem and globin; haem combines with albumin to make methaemalbumin.
• Plasma haptoglobin: mops up free plasma Hb, then removed by the liver.
• Haemoglobinuria: causes red-brown urine, in absence of red blood cells.
• Haemosiderinuria: occurs when haptoglobin-binding capacity is exceeded,
causing free Hb to be fi ltered by the renal glomeruli, with absorption of free
Hb via the renal tubules and storage in the tubular cells as haemosiderin. This
is detected in the urine as sloughed tubular cells by Prussian blue staining ~1
week after onset (implying a chronic intravascular haemolysis).
4 Why is there haemolysis? Causes are on p338.
History Family history, race, jaundice, dark urine, drugs, previous anaemia, travel.
Examination Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, gallstones (pigmented, due to bili-
rubin from haemolysis), leg ulcers (due to poor blood fl ow).
Tests FBC, reticulocytes, bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin, urinary urobilinogen. Thick and
thin fi lms for malaria screen if history of travel. The blood fi lm may show poly-
chromasia and macrocytosis due to reticulocytes, or point to the diagnosis:
• Hypochromic microcytic anaemia (thalassaemia).
• Sickle cells (sickle-cell anaemia).
• Schistocytes (fi g 8.30, p339; microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia).
• Abnormal cells in haematological malignancy.
• Spherocytes (hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia).
• Elliptocytes (fi g 8.36, p339; hereditary elliptocytosis).
• Heinz bodies, ‘bite’ cells (fi g 8.32, p339; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
defi ciency).
Further tests (if the cause is still not obvious)
• Osmotic fragility testing will confi rm the presence of membrane abnormalities
which have been identifi ed on the fi lm.
• Hb electrophoresis will detect haemoglobinopathies.
• The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT, fi g 8.28) identifi es red cells coated with
antibody or complement, the presence of which indicates an immune cause.
• Enzyme assays are reserved for when other causes have been excluded.

Causes of haemolytic anaemia
Acquired
1 Immune-mediated/direct antiglobulin test +ve: (Coombs test, p337.)
• Drug-induced: causing formation of RBC autoantibodies from binding to RBC
membranes (eg penicillin) or production of immune complexes (eg quinine).
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA; fi g 8.29): mediated by autoantibod-
ies causing mainly extravascular haemolysis and spherocytosis. Classify accord-
ing to optimal binding temperature to RBCs: Warm AIHA: IgG-mediated, bind
at body T° 37°C. : Steroids/immunosuppressants (± splenectomy). Cold AIHA:
IgM-mediated, bind at T° (<4°C), activating cell-surface complement. Causes a
chronic anaemia made worse by cold, often with Raynaud’s or acrocyanosis. :
keep warm. Chloram bucil may help. Causes: most are idiopathic; 2° causes of
warm AIHA include lymphop roliferative disease (CLL, lymphoma), drugs, autoim-
mune disease, eg SLE. Cold AIHA may follow infection (mycoplasma; EBV).
• Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria: seen with viruses/syphilis. It is caused by
Donath–Landsteiner antibodies sticking to RBCS in the cold, causing self-limit-
ing complement-mediated haemolysis on rewarming.
• Isoimmune: acute transfusion reaction (p349); haemolysis of the newborn.
2 Direct antiglobulin/Coombs Ωve AIHA: (2% of all AIHA.) Autoimmune hepatitis;
hepatitis B & C; post fl u and other vaccinations; drugs (piperacillin, rituximab).
3 Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA): Mechanical damage to RBCS in circula-
tion, causing intravascular haemolysis and schistocytes (fi gs 8.30, 8.31). Causes include
haemolytic–uraemic syndrome (HUS), TTP (p315), DIC, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia.
Prosthetic heart valves can also cause mechanical damage.
4 Infection: Malaria (p416): RBC lysis and ‘blackwater fever’ (haemoglobinuria). All
infections can exacerbate haemolysis.
5 Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Rare acquired stem cell disorder, with
haemolysis (esp. at nighthaem oglobinuria, fi g 15.8, p705), marrow failure +
thrombophilia. Tests: urinary haemosiderin +ve; if suspect in Coombs -ve
intravascular haemolysis, seek confi rmation by fl ow cytometry. : anti coagulation;
monoclonal anticomplement antibodies (eg eculizumab); stem cell transplantation.
Hereditary
1 Enzyme defects:
• Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi ciency (X-linked): the chief
RBC enzyme defect, aff ects 100 million (mainly ) in Mediterranean, Africa,
Middle/Far East. Most are asymptomatic, but may get oxidative crises due to
gluta thione production, precipitated by drugs (eg primaquine, sulfonamides,
aspirin), exposure to Vicia faba (broad beans/favism), or illness. In attacks, there
is rapid anaemia and jaundice. Film: bite- and blister-cells (fi gs 8.32, 8.33). Tests:
Enzyme assay (>8wks after crisis as young RBCs may have enough enzyme so
results normal). : Avoid precipitants (eg, henna, fi g 8.34); transfuse if severe.
• Pyruvate kinase defi ciency (AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE): ATP production causes RBC
survival. Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice; later, haemolysis with splenomeg-
aly ± jaundice. Tests: enzyme assay. : often not needed; splenectomy may help.
2 Membrane defects: All are Coombs Ωve; all need folate; splenectomy helps some.
• Hereditary spherocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): prevalence: 1:3000. Less de-
formable spherical RBCS, so trapped in spleen  extravascular haemolysis. Signs:
Splenomegaly, jaundice. Tests: Mild if Hb >110g/L and reticulocytes <6%; fi lm: fi g
8.35.  Bilirubin (gallstones).
• Hereditary elliptocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): fi lm: fi g 8.36. Mostly asympto-
matic (somewhat protects from malaria). 10% display a more severe phenotype
(± death in utero).
• Hereditary ovalocytosis and stomatocytosis are rarer. Refer to a haematologist.
3 Haemoglobinopathy: • Sickle-cell disease (p340). • Thalassaemia (p342).

Sickle-cell anaemia
Sickle-cell anaemia is an autosomal recessive disorder in which production of abnor-
mal haemoglobin results in vaso-occlusive crises. It is most commonly seen in people
of African origin, and arises from an amino acid substitution in the gene coding for
the  chain (Glu  Val at position 6) which leads to production of HbS rather than
HbA (HbA2 and HbF are still produced). Homozygotes (SS) have sickle-cell anaemia
(HbSS), and heteroz ygotes (HbAS) have sickle-cell trait, which causes no disability
(and protects from falciparum malaria). Heterozygotes may still, however, experi-
ence symptomatic sickling in hypoxia, eg in unpressurized aircraft or anaesthesia (so
all those of African descent need a pre-op sickle-cell test).
Pathogenesis HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing RBCS to deform, pro-
ducing sickle cells, which are fragile and haemolyse, and also block small vessels.
Prevalence 1:700 people of African descent.
Tests Haemolysis is variable. Hb ≈ 60–90g/L, reticulocytes 10–20%, bilirubin.
Film: sickle cells and target cells (fi g 8.37). Sickle solubility test: +ve, but does not
distinguish between HbSS and HbAS. Hb electrophoresis: Confi rms the diagnosis
and distinguishes SS, AS states, and other Hb variants. Aim for diagnosis at birth
(cord blood) to aid prompt pneumococcal prophylaxis (vaccine, p167 ± penicillin V).
Signs/symptoms Chronic haemolysis is usually well tolerated (except in crises; see
BOX ‘Managing sickle-cell crises’).
Vaso-occlusive ‘painful’ crisis: Common, due to microvascular occlusion. Often af-
fects the marrow, causing severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or
hypoxia. Hands and feet are aff ected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may
cause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen. CNS infarction occurs
in ~10% of children, leading to stroke, seizures, or cognitive defects. Transc ranial
Doppler ultrasonography indicates risk of impending stroke, and blood transfusions
can prevent this by reducing HbS. Also avascular necrosis (eg of femoral head), leg
ulcers (fi g 8.38) and low-fl ow priapism (also seen in CML, may respond to hydration,
-agonists, eg phenylephrine, or aspiration of blood + irrigation with saline; if for
>12h prompt cavernosus–spongiosum shunting can prevent later impotence).
Aplastic crisis: This is due to parvovirus B19, with sudden reduction in marrow
production, especially RBCs. Usually self-limiting <2wks; transfusion may be needed.
Sequestration crisis: Mainly aff ects children as in adults the spleen becomes
atrophic. There is pooling of blood in the spleen ± liver, with organomegaly, severe
anaemia, and shock. Urgent transfusion is needed.
Complications • Splenic infarction occurs before 2yrs old, due to micro-
vascular occlusion, leading to susceptibility to infection (40% of childhood
sickle deaths are caused this way). • Poor growth. • Chronic renal failure. • Gall-
stones. • Retinal disease. • Iron overload (see BOX ‘A 7-year-old ...’). •Lung damage:
hypoxiafi brosispulmonary hypertension.
Management of chronic disease Get help from a haematologist.
• Hydroxycarbamide if frequent crises (production of fetal haemoglobin, HbF). Dose
example: 20mg/kg/d if eGFR >60mL/min.
• Splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism and immunocompromise. Prophylaxis, in
terms of antibiotics and immunization, should be given (p373).
• Febrile children risk septicaemia: repeated admission may be avoided by early
rescue out-patient antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (eg 2 doses, 50mg/kg IV on day 0
and 1). Consider admission if Hb <50g/L, WCC <5 or >30 ≈ 109/L, T° >40°C, severe
pain, dehydration, lung infi ltration. Seek expert advice.
• Bone marrow transplant can be curative but remains controversial.
Prevention Genetic counselling; prenatal tests (OHCS pp154–5). Parental education
can help prevent 90% of deaths from sequestration crises.

Managing sickle-cell crises
• Give prompt, generous analgesia, eg IV opiates (see p574). Most sickle patients
will have a personalized analgesia plan—ask them! Seek expert help early.
• Crossmatch blood, check FBC and reticulocyte count.
• Do a septic screen: blood cultures, MSU ± CXR if T° or chest signs.
• Rehydrate with IVI and keep warm. Give O2 by mask if Pa O2 or O2 sats <95%.
• Consider starting antibiotics empirically if T° >38°, unwell, or chest signs.
• Measure PCV, reticulocytes, liver, and spleen size twice daily.
• Give blood transfusion if Hb or reticulocytes fall sharply. This helps oxygenation,
and is as good as exchange transfusion. Match blood for the blood group anti-
gens Rh(C, D, E) and Kell, to prevent alloantibody formation.
• Exchange transfusion is reserved for those who are rapidly worsening: it is a
process where blood is removed and donor blood is given in stages. Indications:
severe chest crisis, suspected CNS event, or multiorgan failure—when the propor-
tion of HbS should be reduced to <30%.
• Inform their haematologist of admission early.
The acute chest syndrome: Entails pulmonary infi ltrates involving complete lung
segments, causing pain, fever, tachypnoea, wheeze, and cough. It is serious. Inci-
dence: ~0.1 episodes/patient/yr. 13% in the landmark Vichinsky study needed ven-
tilation, 11% had CNS symptoms, and 9% of those over 20 years old died. Prodromal
painful crisis occur ~2.5 days before any abnormalities on CXR in 50% of patients.
The chief causes of the infi ltrates are fat embolism from bone marrow or infection
with Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, or viruses. : O2, analgesia, empirical antibiotics
(cephalosporin + macrolide) until culture results known. Bronchodilators (eg sal-
butamol, p182) have proved to be eff ective in those with wheezing or obstructive
pulmonary function at presentation. Blood transfusion (exchange if severe). Take
to ITU if Pa O2 cannot be kept above 9.2kPa (70mmHg) when breathing air.
Patient-controlled analgesia is a good option if supportive measures and oral
analgesia do not control pain. Start with morphine 1mg/kg in 50mL 5% glucose
(paediatric dose) and try a rate of 1mL/h, allowing the patient to deliver extra
boluses of 1mL when needed. Check respiratory rate and GCS every ¼h + O2 sats
if chest/abdominal pain. Liaise with the local pain service.

A 7-year-old tells us what it’s like to have sickle-cell disease
‘I have been hospitalized over 50 times for complications from this disease. To
keep it controlled I started having monthly transfusions. After repeated trans-
fusions my body began to get too much iron so I had to start getting infusions.
I was taking the medication desferal5 which my mummy had to insert a needle
in my belly hooked up to a pump which I had to carry on my back in my neat
Spiderman backpack. I was hooked up to the machine for 10 hours a day 5 days
a week but it was okay I still got to play!!! I suff ered from pain crisis which
makes my legs and back hurt like someone is hitting me with a hammer.
You may notice that I may move slow or look tired when it is time for my
blood transfusion. That is because the transfusions are like a heartbeat for my
body, without it I can’t survive. When I’m in pain the only thing that helps is
morphine… I tell my mummy when she’s crying I WILL BE OK!!’
5 This was necessary until a once-daily oral iron chelator came along: deferasirox.

Thalassaemia
The thalassaemias are genetic diseases of unbalanced Hb synthesis, with underpro-
duction (or no production) of one globin chain (see table 8.2 and BOX). Unmatched
globins precipitate, damaging RBC membranes, causing their haemolysis while still
in the marrow. They are common in areas from the Mediterranean to the Far East.
The  thalassaemias Usually caused by point mutations in -globin genes on
chromosome 11, leading to  chain production (+) or its absence (0). Various
combinations of mutations are possible (eg 0/0, +/+, or +/0).
Tests: FBC, MCV, fi lm, iron, HbA2, HbF, Hb electrophoresis. MRI where myocardial
siderosis suspected (from iron overload).
 thalassaemia minor or trait (eg /+; heterozygous state): this is a carrier
state, and is usually asymptomatic. Mild, well-tolerated anaemia (Hb >90g/L)
which may worsen in pregnancy. MCV <75fL, HbA2 >3.5%, slight HbF. Often con-
fused with iron-defi ciency anaemia.
 thalassaemia intermedia: describes an intermediate state with moderate anae-
mia but not requiring transfusions. There may be splenomegaly. There are a vari-
ety of causes including mild homozygous  thalassaemia mutations, eg +/+, or
co-inheritance of  thalassaemia trait with another haemoglobinopathy, eg HbC
thalassaemia (one parent has the HbC trait, and the other has +). Sickle-cell +
thalassaemia produces a picture similar to sickle-cell anaemia.
 thalassaemia major: denotes signifi cant abnormalities in both -globin genes,
and presents in the 1st year, with severe anaemia and failure to thrive. Extra-
medullary haematopoiesis (RBCS made outside the marrow) occurs in response to
anaemia, causing characteristic head shape, eg skull bossing (fi gs 8.39, 8.40) and
hepato spleno megaly (also due to haem olysis). There is osteopenia (may respond
to zoledronic acid). Skull X-ray shows a ‘hair on end’ sign due to marrow activity.
Life-long blood transfusions are needed, with resulting iron overload/deposition
seen after ~10yrs as endocrine failure (pituitary, thyroid, pancreasdiabetes mel-
litus), liver disease, and cardiac toxicity. The fi lm shows very hypochromic, micro-
cytic cells + target cells + nucleated RBCs. HbF, HbA2 variable, HbA absent.
Treatment: Promote fi tness; healthy diet. Folate supplements help.
• Regular (~2–4 weekly) life-long transfusions to keep Hb >90g/L, to suppress the
ineff ective extramedullary haematopoiesis and to allow normal growth. Iron
overload is a big problem causing hypothyroidism, hypocalcaemia, and hypo-
gonadism. Can be mitigated by iron-chelators (deferiprone PO + desferrioxamine
sc twice weekly. SE: pain, deafness, cataracts, retinal damage, risk of Yersinia).
Large doses of ascorbic acid can also help by urinary excretion of iron.
• Splenectomy if hypersplenism persists with increasing transfusion requirements
(p373)—this is best avoided until >5yrs old due to risk of infections.
• Hormonal replacement or treatment for endocrine complications, eg diabetes
mellitus, hypothyroidism. Growth hormone treatment has had variable success.
• A histocompatible marrow transplant can off er the chance of a cure.
Prevention: Approaches include genetic counselling or antenatal diagnosis using
fetal blood or DNA, then ‘therapeutic’ abortion.
The  thalassaemias (fi g 8.41) There are two separate -globin genes on each
chromosome 16  there are four genes (termed /). The  thalassaemias are
mainly caused by gene deletions. If all four  genes are deleted (--/--), death is in
utero (Bart’s hydrops). Here, HbBarts (4) is present, which is physiologically use-
less. HbH disease occurs if three genes are deleted (--/-); there may be moderate
anaemia and features of haemolysis: hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, and jaun-
dice. In the blood fi lm, there is formation of 4 tetramers (=HbH) due to excess 
chains, HbBarts, HbA, and HbA2. If two genes are deleted (--/ or -/-), there
is an asymptomatic carrier state, with MCV. With one gene deleted, the clinical
state is normal.

Adult haemoglobin (HbA ) is a tetramer of 2 - and 2 -globin chains each con-
taining a haem group. In the fi rst year of life, adult haemoglobin replaces fetal
haemoglobin (HbF).
It might be thought that because the molecular details of the thalassaemias are
so well worked out they represent a perfect example of the reductionist principle
at work: fi nd out exactly what is happening within molecules, and you will be able
to explain all the manifestations of a disease. But this is not so. We have to recog-
nize that two people with the identical mutation at their  loci may have quite dif-
ferent diseases. Co-inheritance of other genes and conditions (eg  thalassaemia)
is part of the explanation, as is the effi ciency of production of fetal haemoglobin.
The reasons lie beyond simple co-segregation of genes promoting the formation
of fetal Hb. The rate of proteolysis of excess -globin chains may also be impor-
tant—as may mechanisms that have little to do with genetic or molecular events.

Bleeding disorders
After injury, three processes halt bleeding: vasoconstriction, gap-plugging by plate-
lets, and the coagulation cascade (fi g 8.42). Disorders of haemostasis fall into these
three groups. The pattern of bleeding is important—vascular and platelet disorders
lead to prolonged bleeding from cuts, bleeding into the skin (eg easy bruising and
purpura), and bleeding from mucous membranes (eg epistaxis, bleeding from gums,
menorrhagia). Coagulation disorders cause delayed bleeding into joints and muscle.
1 Vascular defects Congenital: Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p708), conne ctive
tissue disease (eg Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, OHCS p642, pseudoxanthoma elasticum).
Acquired: Senile purpura, infection (eg meningococcal, measles, dengue fever),
steroids, scurvy (perifollicular haemorrhages), Henoch–Schönlein purpura (p702).
2 Platelet disorders Decreased marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (p364),
megaloblastic anaemia, marrow infi ltration (eg leukaemia, myeloma), marrow
suppression (cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy). Excess destruction: Immune: im-
mune thrombocytopenia (ITP, see BOX ‘Immune thrombocytopenia’), other auto-
immune causes, eg SLE, CLL, drugs, eg heparin, viruses; Non-immune: DIC (p352),
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or HUS (p315), sequestration (in hy-
persplenism). Poorly functioning platelets: Seen in myeloproliferative disease,
NSAIDS, and urea.
3 Coagulation disorders Congenital: Haemophilia, von Willebrand’s disease
(p712). Acquired: Anticoagulants, liver disease, DIC (p352), vitamin K defi ciency.
Haemophilia A Factor VIII defi ciency; inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern in
1 : 10 000 male births—usually due to a ‘fl ip tip’ inversion in the factor VIII gene in
the X chromosome. There is a high rate of new mutations (30% have no family his-
tory). Presentation depends on severity and is often early in life or after surgery/
trauma—with bleeds into joints leading to crippling arthropathy, and into mus-
cles causing haematomas (pressure can lead to nerve palsies and compartment
syndrome). Diagnose by APTT and factor VIII assay. Management: Seek expert
advice. Avoid NSAIDS and IM injections (fi g 8.43). Minor bleeding: pressure and el-
evation of the part. Desmopressin (0 . 3mcg/kg/12h IVI over 20min) raises factor VIII
levels, and may be suffi cient. Major bleeds (eg haemarthrosis): factor VIII levels
to 50% of normal, eg with recombinant factor VIII. Life-threatening bleeds (eg
obstructing airway) need levels of 100%. Genetic counselling: OHCS p154.
Haemophilia B (Christmas disease) Factor IX defi ciency (inherited, X-linked re-
cessive); behaves clinically like haemophilia A. Treat with recombinant factor IX.
Acquired haemophilia is a bleeding diathesis causing big mucosal bleeds in males
and females caused by suddenly appearing autoantibodies that interfere with factor
VIII. Tests: APPT; VIII autoantibody; factor VIII activity <50%. : Steroids.
Liver disease Produces a complicated bleeding disorder with synthesis of clot-
ting factors, absorption of vitamin K, and abnormalities of platelet function.
Malabsorption Leads to less uptake of vitamin K (needed for synthesis of factors
II, VII, IX, and X). Treat with IV vitamin K (10mg). In acute haemorrhage, use hu-
man prothrombin complex or FFP.

Fibrinolysis
The fi brinolytic system works by generating plasmin, which causes fi brin
dissolution. The process starts with the release of tissue plasminogen activa-
tor (t-PA) from endothelial cells, a process stimulated by fi brin formation. t-PA
converts inactive plasminogen to plasmin which can then cleave fi brin, as well
as several other factors. t-PA and plasminogen both bind fi brin thus localizing
fi brinolysis to the area of the clot.
Fibrinolytic agents activate this system and can be utilized in order to break
down pathological thrombi, eg in: acute MI, acute ischaemic stroke, DVT, PE, and
central retinal venous or arterial thrombosis. In all cases the risk of adverse
eff ects of thrombolysis (eg haemorrhage) must be outweighed by the poten-
tial benefi ts. Streptokinase, a streptococcal exotoxin that binds and activates
plasminogen, was the fi rst licensed agent but risks anaphylaxis on repeat dosing.
Alteplase is recombinant t-PA. Newer agents include tenecteplase and reteplase.
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
ITP is caused by antiplatelet auto anti bodies. It is acute (usually in children, 2wks
after infection with sudden self-limiting purpura: OHCS p197) or chronic (seen
mainly in women). Chronic ITP runs a fl uctuating course of bleeding, purpura
(esp. dependent pressure areas), epistaxis, and menorrhagia. There is no spleno-
megaly. Tests: Megakaryocytes in marrow, antiplatelet autoantibodies often
present. : None if mild. If symptomatic or platelets <20 ≈ 109/L, prednisolone
1mg/kg/d, and reduce after remission; aim to keep platelets >30 ≈ 109/L—takes a
few days to work. Platelet transfusions are not used (except during splenecto-
my or life-threatening haemorrhage) as these are quickly destroyed by the au-
toantibodies. IV immunoglobulin may temporarily raise the platelet count, eg for
surgery, pregnancy. If relapse, choices include splenectomy or B-cell depletion
with rituximab. Eltrombopag (an oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist) and
romiplostim (an injectable thrombopoietin analogue) are alternative options for
those with refractory disease.

An approach to bleeding
There are three sets of questions to be answered:
1 Is there an emergency needing immediate resuscitation or senior help?
• Is the patient about to exsanguinate (dizzy on sitting up, shock, coma)?
• Is there hypovolaemia (postural hypotension, oliguria)?
• Is there CNS bleeding (meningism, CNS and retinal signs)?
• Is there an underlying condition which escalates apparently minor bleeding into
an evolving catastrophe? For example:
• Bleeding in pregnancy or the puerperium.
• GI bleeding in a jaundiced patient (ie coagulation factors already depleted).
• Bleeding in someone who is already anaemic (esp if other comorbidities).
2 Why is the patient bleeding? Is bleeding normal, given the circumstances (eg
surgery, trauma, parturition), or does the patient have a bleeding disorder (BOX
‘Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding?’)?
• Is there a secondary cause, eg drugs (warfarin), alcohol, liver disease, sepsis?
• Is there unexplained bleeding, bruising, or purpura?
• Past or family history of excess bleeding, eg during trauma, dentistry, surgery?
• Is the pattern of bleeding indicative of vascular, platelet, or coagulation prob-
lems (p344)? Are old venepuncture or cannula sites bleeding (DIC, p352)? Look
for associated conditions (eg with DIC).
• Is a clotting screen abnormal (table 8.3)? Check FBC, platelets, PT, APTT, and
thrombin time. Consider D-dimers, bleeding time, and a factor VIII assay. If
both PT and APTT are very raised, with low platelets and D-dimers, consider
DIC (p352).
3 In cases of bleeding disorders, what is the mechanism? Investigate with
FBC, fi lm, and coagulation screen (citrate tube; false results if under-fi lled):
• Prothrombin time (PT): Thromboplastin is added to test the extrinsic system.
PT is expressed as a ratio compared to control (international normalized ratio
(INR), normal range = 0.9–1.2). It tests for abnormalities in factors I, II, V, VII, X.
Prolonged by: warfarin, vitamin K defi ciency, liver disease, DIC.
• Activated partial thrombop lastin time (APTT): Kaolin is added to test the
intrinsic system. Tests for abnormalities in factor I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Normal
range 35–45s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, haemophilia, DIC, liver disease.
• Thrombin time: Thrombin is added to plasma to convert fi brinogen to fi brin.
Normal range: 10–15s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, DIC, dysfi brinogenaemia.
• D-dimers are a fi brin degradation product, released from cross-linked fi br in
during fi brinolysis (p345). This occurs during DIC, or in the presence of venous
thromboembolism—deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
D-dimers may also be raised in infl ammation, eg with infection or malignancy.
Management Depends on the degree of bleeding. If shocked, resuscitate (p790). If
bleeding continues in the presence of a clotting disorder or a massive transfusion,
discuss the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates, or platelets with a
haematologist. In ITP (p345), steroids ± IV immunoglobulin may be used. Especially
in pregnancy (OHCS p88), consult an expert. Is there overdose with anticoagulants
(p842)? In haemophiliac bleeds, consult early for coagulation factor replacement.
Never give IM injections.

Special tests may be available (factor assays: consult a haematologist).
Towards a better assay for clotting function
Bleeding time, a barbaric and unreliable test (the clue is in the name), is no longer
used. Amongst the range of techniques to replicate the clotting process in vitro is
thromboelastography (TEG). TEG permits rapid and more precise assays of clotting
function under massive transfusion situations (eg major surgery, especially trauma).
In particular, advances in this fi eld have been driven by recent military usage.
Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding?
Take a bleeding history! The more structured this is the better. Enquire about
factors which may indicate increased bleeding risk, such as:
• past history of excessive, prolonged, or unexplained bleeding
• comorbidities such as lupus or liver disease
• on agents known to aff ect haemostasis.
In such cases, or if bleeding would be disastrous, further tests may be indicated
after discussion with a haematologist.

Blood transfusion and blood products
Blood should only be given if strictly necessary and there is no alternative. Out-
comes may be worse after an inappropriate transfusion.
• Know and use local procedures to ensure that the right blood gets to the right
patient at the right time.
• Take blood for crossmatching from only one patient at a time. Label immedi-
ately. This minimizes risk of wrong labelling of samples.
• When giving blood, monitor TPR and BP every ½h.
• Use a dedicated line where practicable (or dedicated lumen of multilumen line).
Group-and-save (G&S) requests Know your local guidelines for elective surgery.
Having crossmatched blood to hand may not be needed if a blood sample is al-
ready in the lab, with group determined, without any atypical antibodies (ie G&S).
Products2 Whole blood: The only option for the fi rst 250 years of transfusion
history, but now rarely used. Red cells: (Packed to make haematocrit ~70%.) Use
to correct anaemia or blood loss. 1U Hb by 10–15g/L. In anaemia, transfuse until
Hb ~80g/L. Platelets: (p364.) Usually only needed if bleeding or count is <20 ≈ 109/L.
1U should platelet count by >20 ≈ 109/L. Failure to do so suggests refractory cause:
discuss with haematologist. If surgery is planned, get advice if count is <100 ≈ 109/L.
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Use to correct clotting defects: eg DIC (p352); warfarin
overdosage where vitamin K would be too slow; liver disease; thrombotic thrombo-
cytopenic purpura (p315). It is expensive and carries all the risks of blood transfu-
sion. Do not use as a simple volume expander. Human albumin solution is produced
as 4.5% or 20% protein solution and is used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be
used temporarily in the hypoproteina emic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who
is fl uid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load. Also used as replacement
in abdominal paracentesis (p765). Others Cryoprecipitate (a source of fi brinogen);
coag ulation concentrates (self-injected in haemophilia); immunoglobulins.
Complications of transfusion Management of acute reactions:2 see BOX ‘Trans-
fusion reactions’ and table 8.4.
• Early (within 24h): Acute haemolytic reactions (eg ABO or Rh incompatibility);
anaphylaxis; bacterial contamination; febrile reactions (eg from HLA antibodies);
allergic reactions (itch, urticaria, mild fever); fl uid overload; transfusion-related
acute lung injury (TRALI, ie ARDS due to antileucocyte antibodies in donor plasma).
• Delayed (after 24h): Infections (eg viruses: hepatitis B/C, HIV; bacteria; protozoa;
prions); iron overload (treatment, p342); GVHD; post-transfusion purpura—poten-
tially lethal fall in platelet count 5–7d post-transfusion requiring specialist treat-
ment with IV immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions.
Massive blood transfusion This is defi ned as replacement of an individual’s en-
tire blood volume (>10U) within 24h. Complications: platelets; Ca2+; clotting fac-
tors; K+; hypothermia. Seek early and ongoing support from haematologist and
blood bank who should advise on products and monitoring. In acute haemorrhage,
use crossmatched blood if possible, but if not, use ‘universal donor’ group O RhΩve
blood, changing to crossmatched blood as soon as possible.
Transfusing patients with heart failure If Hb 50g/L with heart failure, trans-
fusion with packed red cells is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60–80g/L, but
must be done with care. Give each unit over 4h with furosemide (eg 40mg slow
IV/PO; don’t mix with blood) with alternate units. Check for JVP and basal lung
crackles; consider CVP line.
Autologous transfusion There is a role for patients having their own blood
stored pre-op for later use. Erythropoietin (EPO, p304) can increase the yield of au-
tologous blood in normal people. Intraoperative cell salvage with retransfusion is
also being used more often, especially in cardiac, vascular, and emergency surgery,
Cost-analysis shows that it may be worthwhile on an economic basis alone.

Blood transfusion and Jehovah’s Witnesses
Adult human beings (with mental ‘capacity’ see p568) have an absolute right to re-
fuse any medical treatment, even if to do so seems illogical or could result in their
death. To treat patients despite such a refusal would amount to battery under
common law, or could even amount to a degrading act or torture, against which
the European Convention on Human Rights gives absolute, inalienable protection.
The biblical verse ‘no soul of you shall eat blood’ (Leviticus 17:12) is one of sev-
eral that have been interpreted by some religious groups to extend to acceptance
of blood products in a medical context. Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, may
refuse potentially vital blood transfusions on such grounds. These views must be
respected, but complex issues arise if the patient is a child, or an adult who may
not be able to give or withhold consent in an informed way. In an immediately
life-threatening situation where further delay may cause harm, treatment such
as blood products may be given in the child’s best interest, but the team should
always involve senior paediatricians and hospital ethicists where practical. If the
requirement is less immediate, then the clinicians should seek further legal advice,
which might involve approaching the Courts.

Anticoagulants
Main indications
• Therapeutic: Venous thromboembolic disease: DVT and PE.
• Prophylactic: Prevention of DVT/PE in high-risk patients (p375), eg post-op.
Prevention of stroke, eg in chronic AF or prosthetic heart valves.
Heparin 1 Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH): Eg dalteparin, enoxaparin, tinzapa-
rin. The preferred option in the prevention and initial treatment of venous thromboem-
bolism. Inactivates factor Xa (but not thrombin). t½ is 2- to 4-fold longer than standard
heparin, and response is more predictable: only needs to be given once or twice daily
SC, and laboratory monitoring is usually not required. See BNF for doses. It accumulates
in renal failure: decrease dose for prophylaxis, use UFH for therapeutic treatment
2 Unfractionated heparin (UFH): IV or SC. Binds antithrombin (an endogenous in-
hibitor of coagulation), increasing its ability to inhibit thrombin, factor Xa, and IXa.
Rapid onset and has a short t½. Monitor and adjust dose with APTT (p346).
SE for both: Bleeding (eg at operative site, gastrointestinal, intracranial), heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), osteoporosis with long-term use. HIT and osteo-
porosis are less common with LMWH than UFH. Beware hyperkalaemia.
CI: Bleeding disorders, platelets <60≈109/L, previous HIT, peptic ulcer, cerebral
haemorrhage, severe hypertension, neurosurgery.
Warfarin Used PO OD as long-term anticoagulation. The therapeutic range is nar-
row, varying with the condition being treated (see BOX ‘Warfarin guidelines and
target levels for INR’)—and eff ects are refl ected in the INR. Warfarin inhibits the re-
ductase enzyme responsible for regenerating the active form of vitamin K, producing
a state analogous to vitamin K defi ciency. CI: Peptic ulcer, bleeding disorders, severe
hypertension, pregnancy (teratogenic, see OHCS p640). Use with caution in elderly
and those with past GI bleeds. In the UK, warfarin tablets are 0.5mg (white), 1mg
(brown), 3mg (blue), or 5mg (pink). Interactions: p757.
DOACS (Direct oral anticoagulants.) Rivaroxaban, apixaban (factor Xa inhibitors)
and dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) do not require regular monitoring and
dose adjustment; just a quarterly assessment and annual blood test. They off er an
attractive alternative to warfarin (particularly where monitoring and maintaining
a therapeutic INR is diffi cult). CI: severe renal/liver impairment; active bleeding; le-
sion at risk of bleeding; clotting factors. Interactions: heparin, clopidogrel.
Others Fondaparinux is a pentasaccharide Xa inhibitor and is used in acute coro-
nary syndrome or in place of LMWH for prophylaxis.
Beginning therapeutic anticoagulation (Follow local guidelines, and see BNF.)
For treatment of venous thromboembolism, LMWH or UFH are typically used initially.
When transitioning to warfarin, give heparin in combination (as early as day 1) and
continue until INR is in target therapeutic range on 2 consecutive days (see BOX ‘War-
farin dosage’). Start warfarin at 5–10mg given at 18.00 on days 1 and 2, then check INR
on day 3 (it takes 48–72h for anticoagulant eff ect to develop). Adjust subsequent doses
according to the INR (see table 8.5), which needs to be measured on alternate days until
stable, then weekly or less often. When transitioning to a DOAC switch from heparin (ie
do not coadminister DOAC and heparin). DOACS and warfarin may both be initiated as
monotherapy in chronic AF (DOACS also in less extensive thromboembolism).
Antidotes If UFH overdose: stop infusion. If there is bleeding, protamine sulphate
counteracts UFH: discuss with a haematologist. Warfarin: see BOX ‘Warfarin dos-
age’ and table 8.6. DOACS: challenging and evolving area (including monoclonal
anti-drug antibodies eg idarucizumab for dabigatran)—discuss with haematologist.

Warfarin guidelines and target levels for INR
• Pulmonary embolism and DVT. Aim for INR of 2–3; 3.5 if recurrent PE or DVT
whilst anticoagulated.
• Atrial fi brillation: for stroke prevention (p130). Target INR 2–3.
• Prosthetic metallic heart valves: for stroke prevention. Target INR 2–3 if aortic
valve or 2.5–3.5 if mitral valve.
Duration of anticoagulation in DVT/PE: First episodes of DVT or PE require at least
3 months of anticoagulation. Consider extending this to 6 months in patients with
more extensive, life-threatening clot at presentation, for those with transient but
persistent risk factors (eg prolonged immobility) or if evidence of persistent clot
at 3 months. For those with recurrent unprovoked emboli or underlying throm-
bophilia (p374), consider bleeding risks against benefi ts of indefi nite treatment.
Warfarin dosage and what to do when the INR is much too high
Below is a rough guide to warfarin dosing for target INR of 2–3.
Table 8.5 Suggested dosing for day 3 of warfarin loading
INR <2 2 2.5 2.9 3.3 3.6 4.1
3rd dose 5mg 5mg 4mg 3mg 2mg 0.5mg 0mg

Leukaemia and the on-call junior doctor
Leukaemia divides into four main types depending on the cell line involved (table 8.7).
Table 8.7 Principal subtypes of leukaemia
Lymphoid Myeloid
Acute Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
Chronic Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
These patients (esp. AML) fall ill suddenly and deteriorate fast, eg with:
infection, ble eding (: platelets ± FFP), and hyperviscosity (p372). Take
non-specifi c confusion/drowsiness or just ‘I feel a bit ill today’ seriously: do blood
cultures, FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, glucose, and clotting. Consider CNS bleeding—CT if in
doubt. With any new patient, fi nd out the agreed aim of treatment: cure; prolong-
ing disease-free survival; or palliation with minimal toxicity? Direct your eff orts
accordingly; get help if lack of clarity here.
Neutropenic regimen (For when neutrophil count ≤0.5 ≈ 109/L.)3 Close liaison
with a microbiologist and haematologist is vital. Abide by infection control proce-
dures! Use a risk-assessment tool (eg MASCC, see BOX).
• Full barrier nursing in a side room if possible. Hand-washing is vital.
• Avoid IM injections (danger of an infected haematoma).
• Look for infection (mouth, axillae, perineum, IVI site). Take swabs.
• Check: FBC, platelets, INR, U&E, LFT, LDH, CRP. Take cultures (blood ≈3—peripherally
± Hickman line; urine, sputum, stool if diarrhoea); CXR if clinically indicated.
• Wash perineum after defecation. Swab moist skin with chlorhexidine. Avoid
unnecessary rectal examinations. Oral hygiene (eg hydrogen peroxide mouth
washes/2h) and Candida prophylaxis are important (p246).
• Check vital signs 4-hrly. High-calorie diet; avoid foods with high risk of microbial
contamination. Vases containing cut fl owers pose a Pseudomonas risk.
Use of antibiotics in neutropenia Treat any known infection promptly.
• If T° >38°C or T° >37.5°C on two occasions, >1h apart, or the patient is septic,
start blind combination therapy according to local guidelines—eg piperacillin–
tazobactam—p386 (+ vancomycin, p386, if Gram +ve organisms suspected or iso-
lated, eg Hickman line sepsis). Continue until afebrile for 72h or 5d course, and
until neutrop hils >0.5≈109/L. If fever persists despite antibiotics, think of CMV,
fungi (eg Candida; Aspergillus, p408) and central line infection.
• Consider treatment for Pneumocystis (p400, eg co-trimoxazole, though beware as
this can worsen neutropenia). Remember TB.
Other dangers •Tumour lysis syndrome: Results in K+,  urate, and AKI. See p529.
• Hyperviscosity: (p372). If WCC is >100 ≈ 109/L WBC thrombi may form in brain,
lung, and heart (leukostasis). Avoid transfusing before lowering WCC, eg with
hydroxycarbamide or leukaph eresis, as viscosity rises (risk of leukostasis).
• DIC: The release of procoagulants into the circulation causes widespread activa-
tion of coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets and causing risk of
bleeding. Fibrin strands fi ll small vessels, haemolysing passing RBCs. Fibrinolysis
is also activated. Causes: Malignancy, sepsis, trauma, obstetric events. Signs:
(fi g 8.44) Bruising, bleeding anywhere (eg venep uncture sites), renal failure.
Tests: Platelets; PT; APTT; fi brinogen (correlates with severity); fi brin degra-
dation products (D-dimers). Film: broken RBCS (schisto cytes). : Treat the cause.
Replace platelets if <50≈109/L, cryoprecipitate to replace fi brinogen, FFP to re-
place coagulation factors. Heparin is controversial. The use of all-transretinoic
acid (ATRA) has signifi cantly reduced the risk of DIC in acute pro myelocytic leu-
kaemia (the commonest leukaemia associated with DIC).
• Preventing sepsis: Give fl uoroquinolone (eg ciprofl oxacin) before neutropenia gets
serious. Granulocyte colony stimulators (G-CSF) can increase the production of WBCs
(granulocytes) from bone marrow, but should not be given routinely in chemo-
therapy. Herpes, pneumocystis, and CMV prophylaxis has a role.

MASCC score
The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) assess-
ment tool can be used to predict the risk of serious complications in febrile neu-
tropaenia, and can inform management decisions: if the total score is 21, risk
of septic complications is low and admission may be avoided.
• Solid tumour or lymphoma with no previous fungal infection 4
• Outpatient status at onset of fever (not needing admission) 3
• Age <60yrs 2
• Burden of illness:
• Mild (or no) symptoms 5
• Moderate symptoms 3
• Severe symptoms 0
• No hypotension (systolic BP >90mmHg) 5
• No COPD 4
• No dehydration 3
Note the subjectivity of the ‘burden of illness’ and the omission of potentially vital
variables such as CRP (which, should it fail to fall after starting antibiotics predicts
treatment failure). As with all other scores, the MASCC score should therefore be
interpreted within the context of the individual clinical picture.

intravascular coagulation (DIC) on the sole.

ygolotameaH
Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
A malignancy of lymphoid cells, aff ecting B- or T-lymphocyte cell lineages, arresting
maturation and promoting uncontrolled proliferation of immature blast cells, with
marrow failure and tissue infi ltration. Ionizing radiation (eg X-rays) during preg-
nancy, and Down’s syndrome are important associations. It is the commonest cancer
of childhood, and is rare in adults. CNS involvement is common.
Classifi cation Based on three systems:
1 Morphological:T he FAB system (French, American, British) divides ALL into three types
(L1, L2, L3) by microscopic appearance. Provides limited information (fi gs 8.45–8.48).
2 Immunological: Surface markers are used to classify ALL into:
• Precursor B-cell ALL • T-cell ALL • B-cell ALL.
3 Cytogenetic: Chromosomal analysis. Abnormalities are detected in up to 85%,
which are often translocations.6 Useful for predicting prognosis, eg poor with
Philadelphia chromosome (p358), and for detecting disease recurrence.
Signs and symptoms (fi g 8.49) Due to:
• Marrow failure: anaemia (Hb), infection (WCC), and bleeding (platelets).
• Infi ltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy—superfi cial or medi-
astinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement—eg cranial nerve palsies, meningism.
Common infections: Especially chest, mouth, perianal, and skin. Bacterial septi-
caemia, zoster, CMV, measles, candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (p400).
Tests • Characteristic blast cells on blood fi lm and bone marrow. WCC usually high.
• CXR and CT scan to look for mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy.
• Lumbar puncture should be performed to look for CNS involvement.
Treatment Educate and motivate patient to promote engagement with therapy.
• Support: Blood/platelet transfusion, IV fl uids, allopurinol (prevents tumour lysis
syndrome). Insert a subcutaneous port system/Hickman line for IV access.
• Infections: These are dangerous, due to neutropenia caused by the disease and
treatment: give immediate IV antibiotics. Start the neutropenic regimen (p352) and
give prophylactic antivirals, antifungals, and antibiotics.
• Chemotherapy: Complex multi-drug, multi-phase regimens that may take years:
• Remission induction: eg vincristine, prednisolone, L-asparaginase + daunorubicin.
• Consolidation: high-medium-dose therapy in ‘blocks’ over several weeks.
• CNS prophylaxis: intrathecal (or high-dose IV) methotrexate ± CNS irradiation.
• Maintenance: prolonged chemotherapy, eg mercaptopurine (daily), methotrex-
ate (weekly), and vincristine + prednisolone (monthly) for 2yrs. Relapse is common
in blood, CNS, or testis (examine these sites at follow-up). More details: OHCS p194.
• Matched related allogeneic marrow transplantations: Once in 1st remission is
the best option in standard-risk younger adults.
Haematological remission: Means no evidence of leukaemia in the blood, a normal
or recovering blood count, and <5% blasts in a normal regenerating marrow.
Prognosis Cure rates for children are 70–90%; for adults only 40% (higher when
imatinib/rituximab, p358, are used). Poor prognosis if: adult, male, Philadelphia chro-
mosome (p358: BCR–ABL gene fusion due to translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22),
presentation with CNS signs, Hb , WCC >100≈109/L , or B-cell ALL. PCR is used to detect
minimal residual disease, undetectable by standard means. Prognosis in relapsed
Ph-negative ALL is poor (but improvable by marrow transplant).
Personalized treatment One size does not fi t all! Aim to tailor therapy to the
exact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies,
gene-targeted retinoids, cytokines, vaccines, and T-cell infusions are relevant here.
Biomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase, can predict toxicity from thiopurines.
6 Eg t(12:21) ETV6-RUNX1, t(1;19) TCF3-PBX1, t(9;22) BCR-ABL1, and rearrangement of MLL.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
Neoplastic proliferation of blast cells derived from marrow myeloid elements. It
progresses rapidly (death in ~2 months if untreated; ~20% 3yr survival after ).
Incidence The commonest acute leukaemia of adults (1/10 000/yr; increases with
age). AML can be a long-term complication of chemotherapy, eg for lymphoma. Also
associated with myelodysplastic states (see BOX ‘Myelodysplastic syndromes’), ra-
diation, and syndromes, eg Down’s.
Morphological classifi cation There is much heterogeneity (see BOX ‘Heterogene-
ity in AML’). Four types based on WHO histological classifi cation, cytogenetics, and
molecular genetics:
1 AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities.
2 AML multilineage dysplasia (eg 2° to pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome).
3 AML, therapy related (in those previously treated with cytotoxic drugs).
4 AML, other (not fi tting above-listed; further subclassifi ed as M0–M7 by maturation).
Signs and symptoms • Marrow failure: Anaemia, infection, or bleeding. DIC oc-
curs in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a subtype of AML, where there is release of
thromboplastin (p352). • Infi ltration: Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, gum hypertro-
phy (fi g 8.50), skin involvement. CNS involvement at presentation is rare.
Diagnosis WCC is often , but can be normal or even low. Blast cells may be few
in the peripheral blood, so diagnosis depends on bone marrow biopsy, immuno-
phenotyping, and molecular methods. On biopsy, AML is diff erentiated from ALL by
Auer rods (fi gs 8.51– 8.53). Cytogenetic analysis (eg type of mutation) guides treat-
ment recommendations and prognosis.
Complications • Predisposition to infection by both the disease and the treat-
ment; may be bacterial, fungal, or viral—prophylaxis is given for each during ther-
apy. Be alert to septicaemia (p352): common organisms present oddly and rare
organisms can infect commonly (particularly the fungi Candida and Aspergillus).
Be aware that AML itself causes fever. • Chemotherapy causes plasma urate levels
(from tumour lysis)—so give allopurinol with chemotherapy, and keep well hydrat-
ed with IV fl uids. • Leukostasis (p352) may occur if WCC.
Treatment • Supportive care: As for ALL. Walking exercises can relieve fatigue.
• Chemotherapy: Very intensive, resulting in long periods of marrow suppression
with neutropenia + platelets . The main drugs used include daunorubicin and
cyt arabine, with ~5 cycles given in 1-week blocks to get a remission (RAS muta-
tions occur in ~20% of patients with AML and enhance sensitivity to cytarabine).
• Bone marrow transplant (BMT): Pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells are col-
lected from the marrow. Allogeneic transplants from HLA-matched donors (held
on international databases) are indicated in refractory or relapsing disease. The
idea is to destroy leuka emic cells and the immune system by, eg cyclophospha-
mide + total body irradiation, then repopulate the marrow with donor cells in-
fused IV. Ciclosporin ± methotrexate are used to reduce the eff ect of the new
marrow attacking the patient’s body (GVHD).
• Complications: GVHD (may help explain the curative eff ect of BMT); opportunis-
tic infections; relapse of leukaemia; infertility.
• Prognosis: Lower relapse rates ~60% long-term survivors, but signifi cant mor-
tality of ~10%. Autologous BMT (where stem cells are taken from the patient
themselves) is used in intermediate prognosis disease, although some studies
suggest better survival rates with intensive chemotherapy regimens.
• Autologous mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may off er
faster haemopoietic recovery and less morbidity.
• Supportive care, or lower-dose chemotherapy for disease control, may be more
appropriate in elderly patients, where intensive therapies have poorer outcomes.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, myelodysplasia)
These are a heterogeneous group of disorders that manifest as marrow failure
with risk of life-threatening infection and bleeding (median survival varies from
6 months to 6 years according to disease type). Mostly primary, but can develop
secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 30% transform to acute leukaemia.
Tests: Pancytopenia (p364), with reticulocyte count. Marrow cellularity is usu-
ally increased due to ineff ective haematopoiesis. Ring sideroblasts may also be
seen in the marrow (fi g 8.9, p327).
Treatment:
• Multiple transfusions of red cells or platelets as needed.
• Erythropoietin ± G-CSF (p352) may lower transfusion requirement.
• Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is one option (curative but often inappro-
priate owing to age-related comorbidities—most are >70yrs old).
• Low-intensity treatments that are not curative but may improve quality of life
in symptomatic disease include thalidomide analogues (eg lenalidomide) or hy-
pomethylating agents (eg azacitidine and decitabine).
Heterogeneity in AML
Consider four types of heterogeneity as we move through medical history: mor-
phologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular. Genomic technologies
enable an ever more detailed molecular analysis of AML and this can be used to in-
form prognosis and guide risk stratifi cation. Epigenetic and other profi ling reveals
more and more biomarkers, eg mutations in the genes encoding DNA (cytosine-5)-
methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A).

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)
CML is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid cells (fi g 8.54).
It accounts for 15% of leukaemias. It is a myeloproliferative disorder (p366) having
features in common with these diseases, eg splenomegaly. It occurs most often
between 40–60yrs, with a slight male predominance, and is rare in childhood.
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) Present in >80% of those with CML. It is a hybrid
chromosome comprising reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromo-
some 9 and the long arm of chromosome 22—t(9;22)—forming a fusion gene BCR/
ABL on chromosome 22, which has tyrosine kinase activity. Those without Ph have a
worse prognosis. Some patients have a masked translocation—cytogenetics do not
show the Ph, but the rearrangement is detectable by molecular techniques.
Symptoms Mostly chronic and insidious: weight, tiredness, fever, sweats. There
may be features of gout (due to purine breakdown), bleeding (platelet dysfunction),
and abdominal discomfort (splenic enlargement). ~30% are detected by chance.
Signs Splenomegaly (>75%)—often massive. Hepatomegaly, anaemia, bruising (fi g 8.55).
Tests WBC (often >100≈109/L) with whole spectrum of myeloid cells, ie neutro-
phils, monocytes, basophils, eosinophils. Hb or , platelets variable. Urate, B12.
Bone marrow hypercellular. Cytogenetic analysis of blood or bone marrow for Ph.
Natural history Variable, median survival 5–6yrs. There are three phases: Chronic,
lasting months or years of few, if any, symptoms. • Accelerated phase, with increas-
ing symptoms, spleen size, and diffi culty in controlling counts. • Blast transforma-
tion, with features of acute leukaemia ± death. Treatment See BOX.

Treating CML
CML is the fi rst example of a cancer where knowledge of the genotype has led
to a specifi cally targeted drug—imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This
has transformed therapy over the last 10yrs. Side eff ects are usually mild: nausea,
cramps, oedema, rash, headache, arthralgia. May cause myelosuppression.
More potent 2nd-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors: dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib,
and ponatinib. Dasatinib and nilotinib allow more patients to achieve deeper,
more rapid responses associated with improved outcomes, and dasatinib has
been used in imatinib-resistant blast crises (though NICE says that it is often not
cost-eff ective). Hydroxycarbamide is also used.
Those with lymphoblastic trans formation may benefi t from treatment as
for ALL. Treatment of myeloblastic transformation with chemotherapy rarely
achieves lasting remission, and allo geneic transplantation off ers the best hope.
Stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic transplantation from an HLA-matched sib-
ling or unrelated donor off ers the only cure, but carries signifi cant morbidity and
mortality. Guidelines suggest that this approach should be only rarely used 1st line
in young patients (where mortality rates are lower). Other patients should be of-
fered a BCR-ABL inhibitor. Patients are then reviewed annually to decide whether to
continue, to off er combination therapy or stem cell transplantation.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
CLL is the commonest leukaemia (>25%; incidence: ~5/100 000/yr). :≈2:1. The hall-
mark is progressive accumulation of a malignant clone of functionally incompetent
B cells. Mutations, trisomies, and deletions (eg del17p13) infl uence risk (table 8.8).
Table 8.8 Staging and survival in CLL
Rai stage: 0 Lymphocytosis alone Median survival >13yrs
I Lymphocytosis + lymphadenopathy 8yrs
II Lymphocytosis + spleno- or hepatomegaly 5yrs
III Lymphocytosis + anaemia (Hb <110g/L) 2yrs
IV Lymphocytosis + platelets <100 ≈ 109/L 1yr
Symptoms Often none, presenting as a surprise fi nding on a routine FBC. Patients
may be anaemic or infection-prone, or have weight, sweats, anorexia if severe.
Signs Enlarged, rubbery, non-tender nodes (fi g 8.56). Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly.
Tests Lymphocytes—may be marked (fi g 8.57). Later: autoimmune haemolysis
(p338), marrow infi ltration: Hb, neutrophils, platelets.
Complications 1 Autoimmune haemolysis. 2 Infection due to hypogammaglobuli-
naemia (=IgG), bacterial, viral especially herpes zoster. 3 Marrow failure.
Treatment Consider drugs if symptomatic. Fludarabine + rituximab ± cyclophos-
phamide is 1st line (there is synergism). Ibrutinib, chlorambucil, bendamustine, and
ofatumumab all have a role.Steroids help autoimmune haemolysis. Radiotherapy
helps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Stem-cell transplantation may have
a role in carefully selected patients. Supportive care: Transfusions, IV human im-
munoglobulin if recurrent infection.
Natural history ⅓ never progress (or even regress), ⅓ progress slowly, and ⅓ pro-
gress actively. CD23 and 2 microglobulin correlate with bulk of disease and rates of
progression. Death is often due to infection or transformation to aggressive lym-
phoma (Richter’s syndrome).

Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)
Lymphomas are disorders caused by malignant proliferations of lymphocytes. These
accumulate in the lymph nodes causing lymphadenopathy, but may also be found in pe-
ripheral blood or infi ltrate organs. Lymphomas are histologically divided into Hodgkin’s
and non-Hodgkin’s types. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma,7 characteristic cells with mirror-im-
age nuclei are found, called Reed–Sternberg cells (fi gs 8.58–8.60).
Incidence Two peaks: young adults (HL is the commonest malignancy in 15–24yr olds) and
elderly. : ≈ 2:1. Risk factors: An aff ected sibling; EBV (p405); SLE; post-transplantation .
Symptoms Often presents with enlarged, non-tender, ‘rubbery’ superfi cial lymph
nodes (60–70% cervical, fi g 8.61, also axillary or inguinal). Node size may fl uctuate,
and they can become matted. 25% have constitutional upset, eg fever, weight loss,
night sweats, pruritus, and lethargy. There may be alcohol-induced lymph node pain.
Mediastinal lymph node involvement can cause mass eff ect, eg bronchial or SVC ob-
struction (p528), or direct extension, eg causing pleural eff usions.
Signs Lymphadenopathy. Also, cachexia, anaemia, spleno- or hepatomegaly.
Tests Tissue diagnosis: Lymph node excision biopsy if possible. Image-guided nee-
dle biopsy, laparotomy, or mediastinoscopy may be needed. Bloods: FBC, fi lm, ESR, LFT,
LDH, urate, Ca2+. ESR or Hb indicate a worse prognosis. LDH  as it is released during
cell turnover. Imaging: CXR, CT/PET of thorax, abdo, and pelvis.
Staging (Ann Arbor system.) Infl uences treatment and prognosis. Done by imaging
± marrow biopsy if B symptoms, or stage III–IV disease.
I Confi ned to single lymph node region.
II Involvement of two or more nodal areas on the same side of the diaphragm.
III Involvement of nodes on both sides of the diaphragm.
IV Spread beyond the lymph nodes, eg liver or bone marrow.
Each stage is either ‘A’—no systemic symptoms other than pruritus; or ‘B’—presence
of B symptoms: weight loss >10% in last 6 months, unexplained fever >38°C, or night
sweats (needing change of clothes). ‘B’ indicates worse disease. Localized extra-nod-
al extension does not advance the stage, but is indicated by subscripted ‘E’, eg I-AE.
Chemoradiotherapy Radiotherapy + short courses of chemotherapy for stages
I-A and II-A (eg with ≤3 areas involved). Longer courses of chemotherapy for II-A
with >3 areas involved through to IV-B. ‘ABVD’: Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomy-
cin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine cures ~80% of patients. More intensive regimens are
used if poor prognosis or advanced disease.8 In relapsed disease: high-dose chem-
otherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
Complications of treatment: See pp524–7. Radiotherapy may  risk of second
malignancies—solid tumours (especially lung and breast, also melanoma, sarcoma,
stomach and thyroid cancers), ischaemic heart disease, hypothyroidism, and lung
fi brosis due to the radiation fi eld. Chemotherapy SE include myelosuppression,
nausea, alopecia, infection. AML (p356), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and infertility
may be due to both chemo- and radiotherapy—see p525.
5-year survival Depends on stage and grade (table 8.9): >95% in I-A lymphocyte-
predomi nant disease; <40% with IV-B lymphocyte-depleted.
Emergency presentations Infection; SVC obstruction—JVP, sensation of fullness
in the head, dyspnoea, blackouts, facial oedema (seek expert help; see p528).
7 Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866); rediscovered by Samuel Wilks (1824–1911) who magnanimously gave the
disease Hodgkin’s name.
8 Eg BEACOPP (bleomycin/etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone).
In IIB, III, or IV, BEACOPP gives better initial control, but 7yr event-free survival is similar: 78% vs 71%.

Quality of life, lymphoma, and the role of expressive writing
Being treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma is arduous. Our job is often to give en-
couragement—the more this is personalized for our individual patient the better.
One method is to encourage our patients to write about their experiences. In
one study this gave clear-cut benefi ts in lymphoma patients. Participants report
positive responses to writing, and half said that writing changed their thoughts
about their illness in a positive way (this increased on subsequent follow-up).
Textual analysis identifi es themes related to experiences of positive change,
transformation, and self-affi rmation through refl ection. These techniques are
akin to those used in post-traumatic stress—and remind us that some of our
treatments are as destabilizing to our patients as any shipwreck or earthquake.
‘I can whine, I can complain, I can moan, and bitch, about all of the above, but I
won’t…. The true feat isn’t escaping death, rather, learning how to live.’
Sometimes narrating lymphoma experiences reveals bitterness, loss of control,
and a feeling that life has been rendered void. Here our role is to receive these
negatives and to try to keep the channels of communication open, as dialogue
is the only validated means of fi lling these voids. The need to enhance support
networks and bolster social ties may trump all our pharmacological imperatives.

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
This includes all lymphomas without Reed–Sternberg cells (p360)—a diverse group.
Most are derived from B-cell lines; diff use large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is common-
est. Not all centre on nodes (extranodal tissues generating lymphoma include muco-
sa-associated lymphoid tissue, eg gastric MALT, later in topic). Incidence has doubled
since 1970 (to 2: 10 000). Causes Immunodefi ciency—drugs; HIV (usually high-grade
lymphoma from EBV transformed cells, p405); HTLV-1, p405; H. pylori; toxins; congenital.
Signs and symptoms • Superfi cial lymphadenopathy (75% at presentation).
• Extranodal disease (50%) Gut (commonest): 1 Gastric MALT is caused by H. pylori,
and may regress with its eradication (p252). Symptoms: as for gastric Ca (p619),
with systemic features (see below). MALT usually involves the antrum, is multifocal,
and metastasizes late. 2 Non-MALT gastric lymphomas (60%) are usually diff use
large-cell B lymphomas—high-grade and not responding well to H. pylori eradi-
cation. 3 Small-bowel lymphomas eg IPSID (immunoproliferative small intestine
disease p370), or EATCL (enteropathy/coeliac-associated intra-epithelial T-cell lym-
phoma)—presents with diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight. Poor
prognosis. Skin: (2nd commonest—see fi g 8.62) Eg clonal T cells in mycosis fungoi-
des (accounts for ~50%—p596). Oropharynx: Waldeyer’s ring lymphoma causes
sore throat/obstructed breathing. Other possible sites: Bone, CNS, and lung.
• Systemic features—fever, night sweats, weight loss (less common than in Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma, and indicates disseminated disease).
• Pancytopenia from marrow involvement—anaemia, infection, bleeding (platelets).
Tests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT. LDH ≈ worse prognosis, refl ecting cell turnover. Marrow
and node biopsy for classifi cation (complex, based on the WHO system of high- or
low-grade). Staging: Ann Arbor system (p360)—CT ± PET of chest, abdomen, pelvis.
Send cytology of any eff usion; LP for CSF cytology if CNS signs.
Diagnosis/management is multidisciplinary, synthesizing details from clinical
evaluation, histology, immunology, molecular genetics, and imaging. Generally:
• Low-grade lymphomas are indolent, often incurable and widely disseminated. In-
clude: follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma/MALT, lymphocytic lympho-
ma (closely related to CLL and treated similarly), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma
(produces IgM = Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, p370). See fi g 8.63.
• High-grade lymphomas are more aggressive, but often curable. There is often
rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms. Include: Burkitt’s
lymphoma (childhood disease with characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy; fi gs 8.64,
8.65), lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL), diff use large B-cell lymphoma.
Treatment Huge range of options, depending on disease subtype. Low grade:
If symptomless, none may be needed. Radiotherapy may be curative in localized
disease. Chlorambucil is used in diff use disease. Remission may be maintained by
using interferon alfa or rituximab (see later in paragraph). Bendamustine is eff ec-
tive both with rituximab and as a monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients.
High grade: (eg large B-cell lymphoma, DLBCL), ‘R-CHOP’ regimen: Rituximab, Cy-
clophosphamide, Hydroxy daunorubicin, vincristine (Oncovin®) and Prednisolone.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) help neutropenia—eg fi lgrastim or
lenograstim (at low doses it may be cost-eff ective).
Survival Histology is important. Prognosis is worse if, at presentation: • Age >60yrs.
• Systemic symptoms. • Bulky disease (abdominal mass >10cm). • LDH. • Dissem-
inated disease. Typical 5yr survival for treated patients: ~30% for high-grade and
>50% for low-grade lymphomas, but the picture is very variable.

The role of rituximab in untreated follicular lymphoma
Rituximab kills CD20 +ve cells by antibody-directed cytotoxicity ± apoptosis in-
duction. It also sensitizes cells to CHOP. It is cost-eff ective when used with:
• cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP)
• cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP)
• cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisolone, and interferon alfa (CHVPi)
• mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP)
• chlorambucil.
It also has a role in maintaining remission, and in relapsed disease.

Pancytopenia and bone marrow failure
Bone marrow is responsible for haematopoiesis. In adults, this normally takes place
in the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull) and proximal long bones.
In some anaemias (eg thalassaemia), increased demand induces haematopoiesis
beyond the marrow (extramedullary haematopoiesis), in liver and spleen, causing
organomegaly. All blood cells arise from an early pluripotent stem cell, which divides
asymmetrically to produce another stem cell and a progenitor cell committed to a
lineage (see fi g 8.66). Committed progenitors further diff erentiate into myeloid or
lymphocyte lineages, releasing their progeny into the blood.
Pancytopenia Reduction in all the major cell lines: red cells, white cells, and platelets.
Causes are due to: 1 Marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (see BOX), infi ltration (eg
acute leukaemia, myelodysplasia, myeloma, lymphoma, solid tumours, TB), megalo-
blastic anaemia, myelofi brosis (p366). 2 Peripheral destruction: Hypersplenism.
Agranulocytosis Implies that granulocytes (WBCs with neutrophil, basophil, or
eosin ophil granules) have stopped being made, leaving the patient at risk of fatal
infections. Many drugs can be the culprit: eg carbimazole, procainamide, sulfona-
mides, gold, clozapine, dapsone. When starting drugs known to cause agranu-
locytosis, warn patients to report any fever. Neutropenia (wcc 0.5≈109/L) may
declare itself initially as a sore throat. Stop the drug, commence neutropenic regi-
men and consider G-CSF if indicated (p352).
Marrow support Red cells survive for ~120d, platelets for ~8d, and neutrophils for
1–2d, so early problems are mainly from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
1 Red cell transfusion: Transfusing 1U should raise Hb by ~10–15g/L (p348). Trans-
fusion may drop the platelet count (you may need to give platelets before or after).
2 Platelets: Traumatic bleeds, purpura, and easy bruising occur if platelets
<50≈109/L. Spontaneous bleeding may occur if platelets <20≈109/L, with intrac-
ranial haemo rrhage rarely. Platelets are stored at room temperature (22°C; not
in the fridge). In marrow transplant or if severely immunosuppressed, platelets
may need irradiation before use to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. Platelets
must be ABO compatible. They are not used in ITP (p345). Indications: • Platelets
<10≈109/L. • Haemorrhage (eg DIC, p352). • Before invasive procedures (eg biopsy,
lumbar puncture) to increase count to >50≈109/L. 4U of platelets should raise the
count to >40≈109/L in adults; check dose needed with lab.
3 Neutrophils: Use neutropenic regimen if the count <0.5≈109/L (p352).
Bone marrow biopsy Gives diagnostic information where there are abnormalities
in the peripheral blood; it is also an important staging test in the lymphoprolifera-
tive disorders. Ideally take an aspirate and trephine usually from the posterior iliac
crest (aspirates can be taken from the anterior iliac crest or sternum). The aspirate
provides a fi lm which is examined by microscope. The trephine is a core of bone
which allows assessment of bone marrow cellularity, architecture, and the presence
of infi ltrative disease (eg neoplasia). Coagulation disorders may need to be corrected
pre-biopsy. Apply pressure afterwards (lie on that side for 1–2h if platelets are low).
Aplastic anaemia
This is a rare (~5 cases per million/year) stem cell disorder in which bone marrow
stops making cells, leading to pancytopenia. Presents with features of anaemia
(Hb), infection (WCC), or bleeding (platelets). Causes: Most cases are autoim-
mune, triggered by drugs, viruses (eg parvovirus, hepatitis), or irradiation. May
also be inherited, eg Fanconi anaemia (p698). Tests: Bone marrow biopsy is diag-
nostic. Treatment: Mainly supportive in asymptomatic patients. Transfuse blood
products as required and initiate neutropenic regimen if count <0.5≈109/L (p352).
The treatment of choice in young patients with severe disease is allogeneic mar-
row transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling, which can be curative. Other-
wise, immunosuppression with ciclosporin and antithymocyte globulin may be
eff ective, although it is not curative in most. There is no clear role for G-CSF.

Fig 8.66 Haematopoiesis and Sod’s law. When we contemplate a diagram like this (of seem-
ingly galactic complexity) we, being doctors, think ‘What can go wrong?’ With a sinking feeling
we realize that every arc is an opportunity for multiple disasters. Perhaps, using the Hammer of
Los (p322) and our own ingenuity we might occasionally complete these pathways without Sod
intervening (Sod’s law states that if something can go wrong, it will—here Sod’s tubercular breath
is seen blowing the red cell line off course—TB is a famous cause of leukoerythroblastic anaemia).
When we realize that every day each of us makes 175 billion red cells, 70 billion granulocytes, and
175 billion platelets we sense that Sod is smiling to himself with especial relish. Anything can go
wrong. Everything can go wrong. This latter we call aplastic anaemia. Agranulocytosis is when
the Southerly arcs go wrong; thrombocytopenia when the West-pointing arcs go wrong. To the
East we have the lymphocytes and their B- and T-cell complexities. Anaemia lies in the North of this
diagram. And as for bleeding—how could our predecessors bear to waste a single drop of this stuff
on purpose? Our minds are reeling at 175 billion red cells per day—but this is just when the system
is idling. When we bleed, throughput can rise by an order of magnitude—if Sod is turning a blind
eye are there suffi cient haematinics (eg iron, B12 , and folate) to allow maximum haemopoiesis?

The myeloproliferative disorders
Caused by clonal proliferation of haematopoietic myeloid stem cells in the bone mar-
row. These cells retain the ability to diff erentiate into RBCS, WBCS, or platelets, causing
an excess of one or more of these cell types (table 8.10).
Table 8.10 Classifi cation of myeloproliferative disorders
By proliferating cell type
RBC  Polycythaemia vera (PRV)
WBC  Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, p358)
Platelets  Essential thrombocythaemia
Fibroblasts  Myelofi brosis
Polycythaemia Relative polycythaemia (plasma volume, normal RBC mass)
may be acute (due to dehydration) or chronic (associated with obesity, HTN, and
a high alcohol and tobacco intake). Absolute polycythaemia (RBC mass) is classi-
cally measured by dilution of infused autologous radioactive chromium (51Cr) lab-
elled RBCs. Causes are primary (polycythaemia vera) or secondary due to hypoxia
(eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy
smoking) or inappropriately erythropoietin secretion (eg in renal carcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma).
Polycythaemia vera The malignant proliferation of a clone derived from one
pluripotent stem cell. A mutation in JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) is present in >95%. The
erythroid progenitor off spring are unusual in not needing erythropoietin to avoid
apoptosis. There is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, leading to hy-
perviscosity and thrombosis. Commoner if >60yrs old.
Presentation: May be asymptomatic and detected on FBC, or present with vague
symptoms due to hyperviscosity (p372): headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, visual dis-
turbance. Itching after a hot bath, and erythromelalgia, a burning sensation in fi n-
gers and toes, are characteristic. Signs: facial plethora and splenomegaly (in 60%).
Gout may occur due to urate from RBC turnover. Features of arterial (cardiac, cer-
ebral, peri pheral) or venous (DVT, cerebral, hepatic) thrombosis may be present.
Investigations: • FBC: RCC, Hb, HCT, PCV, often also WBC and platelets. • B12.
• Marrow shows hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia. • Cytogenetics as re-
quired to diff erentiate from CML. • Serum erythropoietin. • Raised red cell mass on
51Cr studies and splenomegaly, in the setting of a normal PaO2, is diagnostic.
Treatment: Aim to keep HCT <0.45 to risk of thrombosis. In younger patients at
low risk, this is done by venesection. If higher risk (age >60yrs, previous thrombo-
sis), hydroxycarbamide (=hydroxyurea) is used. -interferon is preferred in women
of childbearing age. Aspirin 75mg daily is also given.
Prognosis: Variable, many remain well for years. Thrombosis and haemorrhage (due
to defective platelets) are the main complications. Transition to myelofi brosis occurs
in ~30% or acute leukaemia in ~5%. Monitor FBC every 3 months.
Essential thrombocythaemia (fi g 8.67) A clonal proliferation of megakaryo-
cytes leads to persistently platelets, often >1000 ≈ 109/L, with abnormal function,
causing bleeding or arterial and venous thrombosis, and microvascular occlu-
sion—headache, atypical chest pain, light-headedness, erythromelalgia. Exclude
other causes of thrombocytosis (see BOX). Treatment: aspirin 75mg OD. Hydroxy-
carbamide in high-risk patients.
Myelofi brosis There is hyperplasia of megakaryocytes which produce platelet-
derived growth factor, leading to intense marrow fi brosis and haematopoiesis in
the spleen and livermassive hepatosplenomegaly. Presentation: Hypermetabolic
symptoms: night sweats, fever, weight loss; abdominal discomfort due to spleno-
megaly; bone marrow failure (Hb, infections, bleeding). Film: Leuko erythroblastic
cells (nucleated red cells, p328); characteristic teardrop RBCS (see fi g 8.68). Hb. Bone
marrow trephine for diagnosis (fi g 8.69). Treatment: Marrow support (see p364).
Allogeneic stem cell transplant may be curative in young people but carries a high
risk of mortality. Prognosis: Median survival 4–5 years.

Myeloma: the chief plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD)
PCDS are due to an abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma or lympho-
plasmacytic cells leading to secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) or an Ig fragment,
causing the dysfunction of many organs (esp kidney).The Ig is seen as a monoclonal
band, or paraprotein, on serum or urine electrophoresis (see later in topic).
Classifi cation Based on Ig product—IgG in ~ ⅔; IgA in ~ ⅓; a very few are IgM or IgD.
Other Ig levels are low (‘immunoparesis’, causing susceptibility to infection). In ~ ⅔,
urine contains Bence Jones proteins, which are free Ig light chains of kappa (κ) or
lambda (λ) type, fi ltered by the kidney.
Incidence 5/100 000. Peak age: 70yrs. :  ≈ 1:1. Afro-Caribbeans:Caucasians ≈ 2:1.
Clinical features • Osteolytic bone lesions cause backache, pathological fractures
and vertebral collapse. Do serum electrophoresis on all >50 with new back pain.
• Hypercalcaemia may be symptomatic (p676). Lesions are due to osteoclast acti-
vation, from signalling by myeloma cells.
• Anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia may result from marrow infi ltra-
tion by plasma cells, leading to symptoms of anaemia, infection, and bleeding.
• Recurrent bacterial infections due to immunoparesis, and also because of neutro-
penia due to the disease and from chemotherapy.
• Renal impairment due to light chain deposition (p314 & p370) is seen in up to 20%
at diagnosis. The light chains have a toxic and infl ammatory eff ect on the proximal
tubule cells, but the damage is mainly caused by precipitation of light chains in the
distal loop of Henle. Deposits may rarely be AL-amyloid (causing nephrotic syn-
drome, see p370). Monoclonal immunoglobulins also disrupt glomeruli.
Tests Bloods: FBC: normocytic normochromic anaemia. Film: rouleaux (p328). Per-
sistently ESR (p372). Urea and creatinine, Ca2+ (in ~40%). Alk phos usually  unless
healing fracture. Bone marrow biopsy: See fi gs 8.70–8.73. Screening test: Serum
and/or urine electrophoresis. 2-microglobulin (prognostic). Imaging: X-rays: lytic
‘punched-out’ lesions, eg pepper-pot skull, vertebral collapse, fractures, or osteopo-
rosis. CT or MRI may be useful to detect lesions not seen on XR. Diagnostic criteria:
See BOX ‘Myeloma diagnosis’.
Treatment Supportive: • Analgesia for bone pain (avoid NSAIDS due to risk of renal
impairment). Give all patients a bisphosphonate (clod ronate, zolendronate, or pa-
midronate), as they reduce fracture rates and bone pain. Local radiotherapy can help
rapidly in focal disease. Orthopaedic procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty)
may be helpful in vertebral collapse. • Anaemia should be corrected with transfu-
sion, and erythropoietin may be used. • Renal failure: rehydrate, and ensure adequate
fl uid intake of 3L/day to prevent further light chain-induced renal impairment. Di-
alysis may be needed in acute kidney injury. • Infections: Treat rapidly with broad-
spectrum antibiotics until culture results are known. Regular IV immunoglobulin
infusions may be needed if recurrent.
Chemotherapy: Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexa-
methasone. In suitably fi t patients this may be followed by autologous stem-cell
transplantation. In those unsuitable for transplantation, induction therapy is typi-
cally continued for 12–18 months, or until serum paraprotein levels have plateaued.
Treatment is then typically held until (inevitably) paraprotein levels start to rise
again, at which point further chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be
considered. NB: lenalidomide is a teratogenic immunomodulator which has multiple
SE, notably neutropenia and thromboembolism: monitor for sepsis and consider as-
pirin or anticoagulation if risk , eg hyperviscosity or other comorbidities.
Prognosis Worse if: >2 osteolytic lesions, 2-microglobulin >5.5mg/L, Hb <11g/L;
albumin <30g/L. Risk stratifi cation increasingly based upon detection of specifi c
cytogenetic abnormalities associated with high risk of progression. Causes of death:
infection, renal failure.

Complications of myeloma
• Hypercalcaemia (p676). This occurs with active disease, eg at presenta-

balance). IV bisphosphonates, eg zolendronate or pamidronate, are useful for
treating hypercalcaemia acutely.
• Spinal cord compression (p466). Occurs in 5% of those with myeloma. Urgent
MRI if suspected. Treatment is with dexamethasone 8–16mg/24h PO and local
radiotherapy.
• Hyperviscosity (p372) causes reduced cognition, disturbed vision, and bleed-
ing. It is treated with plasmapheresis to remove light chains.
• Acute renal injury is treated with rehydration. Urgent dialysis may be needed.

Paraproteinaemia
Paraproteinaemia denotes the presence in the circulation of immunoglobulins pro-
duced by a single clone of plasma cells. The para protein is recognized as a monoclo-
nal band (M band) on serum electrophoresis.9 There are six major categories:
1 Multiple myeloma See p368.
2 Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia This is a lymphoplasmacytoid lympho-
ma producing a monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Hyperviscosity is common (p372),
with CNS and ocular symptoms. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are also
seen. ESR, with IgM paraprotein on serum electrophoresis. : None if asympto-
matic. Chlorambucil, fl udarabine, or combination chemotherapy may be used.
Plasmapheresis9 for hyperviscosity (p372).
3 Primary amyloidosis See following topic.
4 Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signifi cance (MGUS) is common (3%
>70yrs). There is a paraprotein in the serum but no myeloma, 1° amyloid, macro-
globulinaemia, or lymphoma, with no bone lesions, no Bence Jones protein, and
a low concentration of paraprotein, with <10% plasma cells in the marrow. Some
develop myeloma or lymphoma. Refer to a haematologist (?for marrow biopsy).
5 Paraproteinaemia in lymphoma or leukaemia Eg seen in5 % of CLL.
6 Heavy chain disease Neoplastic cells produce free Ig heavy chains.  chain dis-
ease is most important, causing malabsorption from infi ltration of bowel wall (im-
munoproliferative small intestine disease—IPSID). It may progress to lymphoma.
Amyloidosis
This is a group of disorders characterized by extracellular deposits of a protein in
abnormal fi brillar form, resistant to degradation. The following are the systemic
forms of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition is also a feature of Alzheimer’s disease,
type 2 diabetes mellitus, and haemodialysis-related amyloidosis.
AL amyloid (primary amyloidosis) Proliferation of plasma cell clone  Amyloi-
dogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins  Fibrillar light chain protein deposition 
Organ failure  Death. Associations: myeloma (15%); Waldenström’s, lymphoma.
Organs involved:
• Kidneys: glomerular lesions—proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.
• Heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy (looks ‘sparkling’ on echo), arrhythmias, angina.
• Nerves: peripheral and autonomic neuropathy; carpal tunnel syndrome.
• Gut: macroglossia (big tongue), malabsorption/weight, perforation, haemor-
rhage, obstruction, and hepatomegaly.
• Vascular: purpura, especially periorbital—a characteristic feature (fi g 8.74).
: optimize nutrition; PO melphalan + prednisolone extends survival. High-dose IV
melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation may be better.
AA amyloid (secondary amyloidosis) Here amyloid is derived from serum amyloid
A, an acute phase protein, refl ecting chronic infl ammation in rheumatoid arthritis,
UC/Crohn’s, familial Mediterranean fever, and chronic infections—TB, bronchiectasis,
osteomyelitis. It aff ects kidneys, liver, and spleen (fi g 8.75), and may present with
proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatosplenomegaly. Macroglossia is not seen;
cardiac involvement is rare (ventricular hypertrophy and murmurs). : manage the
underlying condition optimally.
Familial amyloidosis (Autosomal dominant, eg from mutations in transthyretin,
a transport protein produced by the liver.) Usually causes a sensory or autonomic
neuropathy ± renal or cardiac involvement. Liver transplant can cure.
Diagnosis: Made with biopsy of aff ected tissue, and positive Congo Red staining
with apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The rectum or
subcutaneous fat are relatively non-invasive sites for biopsy and are +ve in 80%.
Prognosis: Median survival is 1–2 years. Patients with myeloma and amyloidosis
have a shorter survival than those with myeloma alone.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
The ESR is a sensitive but non-specifi c indicator of the presence of disease. It meas-
ures how far RBCS fall through a column of anticoagulated blood in 1h. If certain
proteins cover red cells, these cause RBCS to stick to each other in columns (the same
phenomenon as rouleaux, p328) so they fall faster.
Causes of a raised ESR Any infl ammation (eg infection, rheumatoid arthritis, ma-
lignancy, myocardial infarction), anaemia, and macrocytosis.
Caveats •ESR  with age. The Westergren method is a rough guide to calculate
the upper limit of normal in older patients:
: ESR=age ÷ 2; : ESR=(age + 10) ÷ 2.
•Some conditions lower the ESR, eg poly-
cythaemia (due to red cell concentration),
microcytosis, and sickle-cell anaemia. Even
a slightly raised ESR in these patients should
prompt one to ask: ‘What else is the mat- Fig 8.76 Hyperviscosity syndrome.
ter?’
Management •In those with a slightly raised ESR, the best plan is probably to wait
a month and repeat the test. •If the ESR is markedly raised (>100mm/h), this can
have a 90% predictive value for disease, so such patients should be thoroughly in-
vestigated, even in the presence of non-specifi c symptoms. Take a full history, ex-
amine carefully and consider these tests: FBC, plasma electrophoresis, U&E, PSA, chest
and abdominal imaging, ± biopsy of bone marrow or temporal artery.
Plasma viscosity (PV)
Normal range: 1.50–1.72mPa/s. In many labs, this has replaced the ESR, as it is less
aff ected by anaemia and simpler to automate. PV is aff ected by the concentration
of large plasma proteins and  in the same conditions as the ESR—both PV and ESR
 in chronic infl ammation and are less aff ected by acute changes (unlike CRP, p686).
Hyperviscosity syndrome
Symptoms Lethargy; confusion; cognition; CNS disturbance; chest pain; abdomi nal
pain (and sometimes spontaneous GI or GU bleeding); faints; visual disturbance (eg
vision, amaurosis fugax, retinopathy—eg engorged retinal veins, haemorrhages,
exudates; and a blurred disc as seen in fi g 8.76). The visual symptoms are like ‘looking
through a watery car windscreen’.
Causes of high blood viscosity Very high red cell count (haematocrit >50, eg
polycythaemia vera), white cell count (>100≈109/L, eg leukaemia), or plasma compo-
nents—usually immunoglobulins, in myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
(p370, as IgM is larger and so  viscosity more than the same amount of IgG). Drugs: oral
contraceptives, diuretics, IV IG, erythropoietin, chemotherapy, radio-contrast media.
Treatment Urgent treatment is needed which depends on the cause. Venesec-
tion is done in polycythaemia. Leukapheresis in leukaemias to remove white cells.
Plasmapheresis in myeloma and Waldenström’s: blood is withdrawn via a plasma
exchange machine, the supernatant plasma from this is discarded, and the RBCS
returned to the patient after being resuspended in a suitable medium.

The spleen and splenectomy
The spleen plays a vital immunological role by acting as a reservoir for lympho-
cytes, and in dealing with bacteraemias.
Causes of splenomegaly: (See also p604.) Massive (enlarged to
the RIF): CML, myelofi brosis, malaria (hyperreactive malarial spleno-
megaly), visceral leishmaniasis, ‘tropical splenomegaly’ (idiopathic—
Africa, south-east Asia), and Gaucher’s syndrome. Moderate: • Infection (eg
EBV, endocarditis, TB, malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis). • Portal hyperten-
sion (liver cirrhosis). • Haematological (haemolytic anaemia, leukaemia especial-
ly CML, lymphoma). • Connective tissue disease (RA, SLE). • Others: sarcoidosis,
primary antibody defi ciency (OHCS p198), idiopathic.
When is a mass in the left upper quadrant a spleen: (Main diff erential: en-
larged left kidney.) The spleen: • Is dull to percussion. • Enlarges towards the
RIF. • Moves down on inspiration. • You may feel a medial notch. • ‘You can’t get
above it’ (ie the top margin disappears under the ribs).
Tests: Image the spleen with abdominal USS or CT. Hunt for the cause of en-
largement: look for lymphadenopathy and liver disease, eg: FBC, ESR, LFT ± liver,
marrow, or lymph node biopsy.
Complications: Symptoms of anaemia, infection, or bleeding can occur as a re-
sult of hypersplenism: cells become trapped in the spleen’s reticuloendothelial
system causing pancytopenia. Splenectomy may be required if severe.
Splenectomy: Main indications: splenic trauma, hypersplenism, autoimmune
haemolysis: in ITP (p345), warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (p338), or
congenital haemolytic anaemias. Mobilize early post-splenectomy as transient
platelets predisposes to thrombi. A characteristic blood fi lm is seen following
splenectomy, with Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and target cells
(see p328).
The main problem post-splenectomy is lifelong increased risk from infec-
tion. The spleen contains macrophages which fi lter and phagocytose bacteria.
Post-splenectomy infection is caused most commonly by encapsulated organ-
isms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, and Neisseria men-
ingitidis. Reduce this risk by giving:
1 Immunizations:
• Pneumococcal vaccine (p167), at least 2 weeks pre-op to ensure good re-
sponse, or as soon as possible after emergency splenectomy, eg after trau-
ma. Re-immunize every 5–10yrs. Avoid in pregnancy.
• Haemophilus infl uenzae type b vaccine (Hib, see p391).
• Meningococcal vaccination course, including Men B, Men C, and Men ACWY.
• Annual infl uenza vaccine (p396).
2 Life-long prophylactic oral antibiotics: phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V)
or erythromycin if penicillin allergic.
3 Pendants, bracelets, or patient-held cards to alert medical staff .
4 Advice to seek urgent medical attention if any signs of infection: will require
admission for broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection develops.
5 If travelling abroad, warn of risk of severe malaria and advise meticulous
prophylaxis, with nets, repellent, and medication.
The advice given here also applies to hyposplenic patients, eg in sickle-cell anae-
mia or coeliac disease.

Thrombophilia
Thrombophilia is an inherited or acquired coagulopathy that predisposes to throm-
bosis, usually venous: DVT or PE (venous thromboembolism: VTE). Special precautions
are needed when there is an additional risk factor for thrombosis, eg surgery, preg-
nancy, or enforced rest (see BOX for other risk factors). Only ~50% of patients with
thrombosis and a +ve family history have an identifi able thrombophilia on routine
tests: others may have abnormalities that are as yet unidentifi ed.
Inherited • Activated protein c (APC) resistance/factor V Leiden: Chief cause of in-
herited thrombophilia. Present in ~5% of the population, although most will not de-
velop thrombosis. Usually associated with a single point mutation in factor V (factor
V Leiden), so that this clotting factor is not broken down by APC. Risk of DVT or PE is
raised 5-fold if heterozygous for the mutation (50-fold if homozygous). Thrombotic
risk is increased in pregnancy and those on oestrogens (OHCS p33, p257 & p303).
• Prothrombin gene mutation: Causes high prothrombin levels and thrombosis
due to down-regulation of fi brinolysis, by thrombin-activated fi brinolysis inhibitor.
• Protein C & S defi ciency: These vitamin K-dependent factors act together to
cleave and so neutralize factors V & VIII. Heterozygotes defi cient for either protein
risk thrombosis. Skin necrosis also occurs (esp. if on warfarin). Homozygous defi -
ciency for either protein causes neonatal purpura fulminans—fatal, if untreated.
• Antithrombin defi ciency: Antithrombin is a co-factor of heparin, and inhibits
thrombin. Less common, aff ects 1:500. Heterozygotes’ thrombotic risk is greater
than protein C or S defi ciency by ~4-fold. Homozygosity is incompatible with life.
Acquired Causes: • Antiphospholipid syndrome (APL: p554)—serum antiphospho-
lipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant ± anticardiolipin antibody) predispose to ve-
nous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss. In most it
is a primary disease, but it is also seen in SLE. • Oral contraceptive pills/HRT (relative
risk 2–4; related to both oestrogen and progesterone content/type). • Any cause of
thrombocytosis or polycythaemia may also cause thrombosis (p366).
Which tests? Ask the lab. Do FBC, fi lm, clotting (PT, thrombin time, APTT, fi brinogen)
± APC resistance test, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and assays
for antithrombin and proteins C & S defi ciency (± DNA analysis by PCR for the factor V
Leiden mutation if APC resistance test is +ve, and for prothrombin gene mutation).
These tests should ideally be done when the patient is well, not pregnant, and off
anticoagulation for 1 month.
Who? Test those with: • arterial thrombosis or MI at <50yrs old (eg for APL)
• unprovoked VTE (ie at <40yrs with no risk factors) • VTE with oral contraceptives/
pregnancy • unexplained recurrent VTE • unusual site, eg mesenteric or portal vein
thrombosis • recurrent fetal loss (≥3) • neonatal thrombosis.
Who not? Those already on lifelong anticoagulation, 1st-degree relatives of peo-
ple with a history of DVT/PE or thrombophilia except in special circumstances.
There is often no benefi t to testing (ie no change to management), it is expensive
and may cause signifi cant worry to patients: be sparing in requesting these tests.
Treatment Anticoagulate acute thrombosis (p350). If recurrence occurs with no
other risk factors, consider lifelong anticoagulation. Recurrence whilst on treat-
ment should be treated by increasing treatment intensity (eg target INR to 3–4).
In antithrombin defi ciency, high doses of heparin may be needed; liaise with a hae-
matologist. In protein C or S defi ciency, monitor treatment closely as skin necrosis
may occur with warfarin.
Prevention Lifelong anticoagulation is not needed in absence of VTE, but advise
of risk with the oral contraceptive pill or HRT, and counsel as regards to the best
form of contraception. Warn about other risk factors for VTE. Prophylaxis may be
needed in pregnancy, eg in antiphospholipid syndrome (get expert help: aspirin
and, sometimes, prophylactic heparin are used as warfarin is teratogenic, see OHCS
p33). Prophylactic SC heparin may also be indicated in high-risk situations, eg pre-
surgery.

Immunosuppressive drugs
As well as being used in leukaemias and cancers, immunosuppression is required in
organ and marrow transplants, and plays a role in the treatment of many diseases:
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, autoimmune hepatitis, asthma, SLE, vasculitis, and
IBD, to name a few.
Prednisolone Steroids can be life-saving, but bear in mind:
• Long-term steroids (>3 weeks, or repeated courses) must not be stopped sud-
dently. Risk of Addisonian crisis due to adrenal insuffi ciency, see p836. Plan a
gradual taper over weeks (with the advice of an endocrinologist if needed).
• Certain conditions may be made worse by steroids, eg TB, hypertension, chicken-
pox, osteoporosis, diabetes: here careful monitoring is needed.
• Growth retardation may occur in young patients, and the elderly frequently get
more SE from treatment.
• Interactions: effi cacy is reduced by anti-epileptics (see later in topic) and ri-
fampicin.
• Caution in pregnancy (may cause fetal growth retardation). See BNF for use in
breastfeeding.
Side effects: Multiple and serious (see table 8.11): minimize these by using the
lowest dose possible for the shortest period of time. Prescribe calcium and vi-
tamin D supplements to reduce risk of osteoporosis (p682) or consider bisphos-
phonates. Before starting long-term treatment, explain clearly the potential SE to
patients and ensure they are aware of the following:
• Do not stop steroids suddenly (p836).
• Consult a doctor if unwell;  steroid dose (eg if requiring antibiotics or surgery).
• Carry a steroid card stating dose taken, and the indication.
• Avoid over-the-counter drugs, eg NSAIDS: aspirin and ibuprofen (risk of DU).
• Exercise and smoking cessation help to prevent osteoporosis.
Azathioprine SE: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, marrow suppression (anaemia, lym-
phopenia), nephritis, pancreatitis, transaminitis. Interactions: Mercaptopurine and
azathioprine (which is metabolized to mercaptopurine) are metabolized by xanthine
oxidase (XO). So toxicity results if full dose azathioprine co-administered with XO
inhibitors (eg allopurinol). Monitoring: Local guidelines should be in place to guide;
typically weekly FBC, U&E, creatine, LFT during initation then 1–3-monthly once stable.
Ciclosporin, tacrolimus Calcineurin inhibitors with important roles in reducing
rejection in organ and marrow transplant. The main SE is dose-related nephrotox-
icity: check blood levels.
• Other SE: gum hyperplasia (ciclosporin), tremor, BP (stop if ), oedema, paraesthe-
siae, confusion, seizures, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma, skin cancer—avoid sunbathing.
• Monitor U&E and creatinine every 2 weeks for the fi rst 3 months, then monthly if
dose >2.5mg/kg/d (every 2 months if less than this). Reduce the dose if creati-
nine rises by >30% on two measurements even if the creatinine is still in normal
range. Stop if the abnormality persists. Also monitor LFT.
• Interactions are legion: potentiated by: ketoconazole, diltiazem, verapamil,
the Pill, erythromycin, grapefruit juice. Effi cacy is reduced by: barbiturates,
carbamaz epine, phenytoin, rifampicin. Avoid concurrent nephrotoxics: eg gen-
tamicin. Concurrent NSAIDs augment hepatotoxicity—monitor LFT.
Methotrexate An antimetabolite. Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which is in-
volved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. See p547.
Cyclophosphamide An alkylating agent. SE: marrow suppression (monitor FBC),
nausea, infertility, teratogenic, haemorrhagic cystitis due to an irritative urinary
metabolite. There is a slight risk of later developing bladder cancer or leukaemia.

What is life?
By convention, life is anything which is organic and converts nutrients into prog-
eny. Failure to meet this defi nition means non-living, dead, dying, or perhaps male.
Life is a thing of dynamism, fragility, beauty, danger, and evanescence; gushing
forth from a single source. But here the certainties end: what does it really take
to be alive? Are viruses and prions living? How many branches are there on our
tree? The harder we look, the more complexities we fi nd. The Hillis plot is a circular
phylogenetic tree, and a representation of humanity’s place in nature. We are duly
humbled by this challenge to our imagined self-importance, reminding us that we
do not in reality occupy a privileged position in the hierarchy of the living, just a
unique subunit RNA sequence (fi g 9.2).
Fig 9.2 Tree of life based on subunit RNA sequences sampled from ~3000 species out of the 1.7
million species that are formally named. The image on the right is a close up of the ‘animal’ seg-
ment of the diagram (upper left quadrant) showing ‘You are here’.

Because micro-organisms kill our friends we think of them as bad:
‘I have no philosophy, nor piety, no art of refl ection, no theory of compensa-
tion to meet things so hide ous, so cruel, and so mad, they are just unspeak-
ably horrible and irremediable to me and I stare at them with angry and
almost blighted eyes.’
Henry James, 1915, describing the death of Rupert Brooke from septicaemia.
But this is a mistake. Kill off micro-organisms and the whole show fi zzles out.
Micro-organisms gave us the DNA and organelles needed for reading and digesting
this page. Even killing a single pathogen might be a mistake: Sod’s Law will prob-
ably ensure that something worse will come to inhabit the vacated ecospace. Prod
one part of the system and events ripple out in an unending stream of unintended
consequences, played out under the stars, which themselves are evolving, and
which donate and receive our primordial elements.
Can we win against infectious diseases? No. But winning or losing is the wrong
image: infectious diseases have made us who we are. All we can do is live with
them. To help us do this in ways that are not too destructive we need robust
public health surveillance, sound vector-control policies, political will, quarantine
laws, openness, and cooperation. Most importantly, do not underestimate the
importance of maintaining our infectious cohabitants in their apparent subor-
dinate position. The speed and capacity for learning by ribonucleic malware and
single-celled organisms is amazing. So do not inadvertently teach them. Preserve
your precious warfare tactics. Expose them to antibiotic therapies only in a
stand-off situation from which they cannot return to fi ght again.

Infectious disease: an overview
It is not possible for any ID chapter to be constructed so that it has the right balance
throughout the world. Many of our readers come from communities where malaria is
the primary diff erential, and AIDS-related deaths are common. In contrast, it is chest,
GU, and ENT infections which predominate in the UK; and AIDS is considered only where
there is failure of either the diagnosis or treatment of HIV, which are universally available
and free at the point of care. Many of the diseases in this chapter cause multisystem
pathology. For these infections, it may be helpful to classify by pathogen (table 9.1).
However, infectious agents do not walk in the door and introduce themselves. Detective
work may be necessary based on geography; or exposure: to vectors, animals, and con-
taminated water/food. And so other pages in this chapter have that as their (helpful)
premise. When infection is organ specifi c, you may need to look elsewhere (table 9.2).

Bacterial infection: an overview
Humans and bacteria are symbiotes, with each of us host to ten times as many
bacterial cells as our own human cells. Our gut, skin, and mucosal linings are covered
with bacteria. We rely on this for nutrition, functioning vitamin K, anti-infl ammatory
eff ects, and immune system regulation.
Bacterial disease results from a breach of the measures that limit bacteria to
their ‘normal’ roles: skin commensals moved into the bloodstream by a cannula, an-
tibiotics altering the commensal microfl ora, immune system evasion or dysfunction
allowing organisms to stray beyond their usual boundaries, toxin production. When
treating infections we should therefore remember to look beyond the off ending or-
ganism and consider what factors may have aided pathogenesis: malnutrition, ‘bar-
rier’ breach by cancer/plastic, immunosuppression.

Bacterial glossary
Bacteria: Prokaryotic micro-organism without a membrane-bound nucleus.
Classifi cation of bacteria: By microscopy and culture of infected samples.
Informs antibiotic choice. Includes:
• Gram stain: a staining technique. Bacteria with
thick, exposed peptidoglycan layers will stain
‘Gram positive’ (purple/blue). Bacteria with a
protected peptidoglycan layer will counterstain
pink/red and are ‘Gram negative’ (fi g 9.3).
• Shape: cocci = round; bacilli = rod-shaped;
spiro chaete = spiral.
• Aerobes/anaerobes: some bacteria cannot sur-
vive without oxygen (obligate aerobes), whilst
others cannot grow in its presence (obligate an-
aerobes). Many more can survive in either en-
vironment (facultative anaerobes). Some types
of infection are more likely to involve aerobic
or anaerobic bacteria, eg GI infections are typi-Fig 9.3 (a) Gram-positive versus

Bacteriostatic: Stops replication without killing existing bacteria.
Capsulate bacteria: Bacteria with a thick outer capsule, eg Haemophilus infl uen-

the alternative pathway.
Enterotoxin: Exotoxin that targets the gut, eg Clostridium diffi cile toxin (p411).
Exotoxin: Toxins secreted by bacteria acting at a site distant from bacterial
growth. Production of an exotoxin can determine virulence, eg botulinum, tetanus,
diphtheria, shiga toxins.
Flagella: A tail-like appendage that moves to propel the bacterium, eg Helico-
bacter pylori.

Antibiotics: action and resistance
The antibiotic revolution began in 1928 when a extraordinary series of fortuitous
events (including a cancelled holiday and an unpredictable British summer) led to
Alexander Fleming’s observation that a contaminating Penicillium colony caused
lysis of staphylococci. Mass production and the ‘golden age’ of antibiotics fol-
lowed, with the introduction of a variety of drugs selectively toxic to bacterial, but
not mammalian cells. This is achieved by:
• utilizing a target unique to bacteria, eg cell wall
• selectively targeting bacterial-specifi c components, eg enzymes, ribosomes
• preventing transport of the drug into human cells, eg metronidazole can only be
transported into anaerobic bacteria.
The mechanism of action of diff erent classes of antibiotic is shown in fi g 9.4.

This spectrum of available antibiotics revolutionized clinical practice and led to
the declaration: ‘It is time to close the book on infectious diseases, and declare
the war against pestilence won’ (attributed in urban legend to Dr. William H
Stewart, US Surgeon General, 1965–1969). Such confi dence failed to consider that
the capacity for a prokaryotic micro-organism to develop resistance far outstrips
the human capacity to develop new antibiotic drugs.
Antibiotic resistance can be:
• Intrinsic: due to inherent structural or functional characteristics, eg vancomycin
cannot cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms.
• Acquired: bacteria have been evolving to resist antibacterial agents for billions
of years through mutation and/or the transfer of resistance properties. This evo-
lutionary phenomenon is accelerated by selection pressure from antibiotic use
(including agriculture, aquaculture, and horticulture) which provides a competi-
tive advantage for mutated, resistant strains.
Resistance has emerged for all known antibiotics causing morbidity, mortality,
and a huge cost burden worldwide.1 Misadventure is evident. Quinolones are syn-
thetic, resistance cannot be acquired in nature, and yet it is epidemic.
Which brings us back to Alexander Fleming who, within 2 years of the mass-
production of his ‘miracle-mould’, gave this sage warning in his Nobel lecture of
1945: ‘Mr X has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not
enough to kill the streptococci, but enough to educate them to resist penicillin.
He then infects his wife. Mrs X gets pneumonia and is treated with penicillin. As
the streptococci are now resistant to penicillin the treatment fails. Mrs X dies.
Who is primarily responsible for Mrs X’s death? Why Mr X, whose negligent use
of penicillin changed the nature of the microbe.’

Antibiotics
A guide to antibiotic prescribing
 Give antibiotics immediately in patients with a systemic infl ammatory response
to infection. See ‘Sepsis’, p792.
Start smart:
1 Do not prescribe2 antibiotics in the absence of clinical evidence of bacterial infec-
tion, or for a self-limiting condition. Take time to discuss:
• why an antibiotic is not the best option
• alternative options, eg symptomatic treatment, delayed prescribing
• the views and expectations of the patient
• safety-netting advice: what the patient should do if their condition deteriorates.
2 Take microbiological samples before prescribing,1 especially for:
• hospital in-patients: review your prescription as soon as MC&S result is available
• recurrent or persistent infection
• non-severe infection: consider if your prescription can wait for MC&S results.
3 Follow local guidelines fi rst: best practice is informed by local epidemiology and
sensitivities.
4 Consider benefi t and harm for each individual patient:
• Allergies: clarify the patient’s reaction—the true incidence of penicillin allergy
in patients who report that they are allergic is <10%. In those with a confi rmed
penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with 3rd-generation cephalosporins and car-
bapenems is possible but rare (<1%).
• Dose adjust for renal function and weight: use ideal body weight in extremes of
BMI (or ideal weight plus a % of excess weight—see local guidelines).
• Check for medication interactions.
• In pregnancy and lactation, see p17.
5 Prescribe the shortest eff ective course. Most antibiotics have good oral avail-
ability. Use IV antibiotics only if in line with local or national (sepsis) guidelines.
Then focus:
Review the clinical diagnosis and continuing need for antibiotics at 48h for all in-
patients and all patients prescribed IV antibiotics:
• Stop antibiotics if there is no evidence of infection.
• Switch from IV to oral whenever possible.
• Change to a narrower spectrum antibiotic whenever possible.
• Continue regular clinical review whilst antibiotics are prescribed.
Antimicrobial stewardship
In England between 2010 and 2014, antibiotic prescribing rose by 4% in general
practice, 12% in hospitals, and 32% in other healthcare settings; E. coli resistance
to ciprofl oxacin increased by 18%, to cephalosporins by 28%, and to gentamicin
by 27%. 25 000 people in Europe die every year from antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Each year ~500 000 develop drug-resistant TB. Cost is the only barrier to buying
carbapenems over-the-counter in Egypt, India, and Pakistan.
‘This will be a post-antibiotic era. In terms of new replacement antibiotics, the
pipeline is virtually dry, especially for Gram negative bacteria. The cupboard is
nearly bare. Prospects for turning this situation around look dim.’
Dr M Chan, Director-General of WHO, March 2012.
Antimicrobial stewardship2 is necessary in all healthcare settings:
• monitoring, evaluation, and feedback on antimicrobial prescribing, bench-
marked against up-to-date local and national guidelines
• evaluation of high/low levels of prescribing and prescribing outside of guidelines
• review of patient safety events: avoidable infection, drug reactions, complica-
tions of antibiotic therapy, eg MRSA (p388), C. diffi cile (p259, p411)
• education and decision support systems for all antibiotic prescribers
• antibiotic pack sizes that correspond to appropriate course lengths
• regular review of all antimicrobial policy, treatment, and prophylaxis guidelines.
1 Clinical diagnosis of low-severity community-acquired pneumonia is an exception, see also UTI p296.

Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis
See fi g 9.4. The bacterial cell wall is unique in nature and therefore acts as a selective
target for antibiotics. Antibiotics which act on the cell wall include:
• -lactam antibiotics
• others: glycopeptides, polymyxins.
-lactams: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam
Contain a -lactam ring which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links
in the bacterial cell wall. Resistance occurs when the bacteria (eg staphylococci)
produce a -lactamase enzyme.
Penicillins:
See table 9.3. Include natural penicillins (penicillin G and V) and synthetic penicillins
which are chemically modifi ed to extend their spectrum of activity, eg amoxicillin,
piperacillin.
In an attempt to overcome -lactamase resistance, penicillins have been combined
with -lactamase inhibitors to create -lactam--lactamase inhibitor combinations
eg co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid), Tazocin® (piperacillin+tazobactam).
Staphylococcal resistance is conventionally defi ned by stability to meticillin, an
acid-labile and IV-only equivalent of fl ucloxacillin (see MRSA p388).
Cephalosporins:
See table 9.4. Contain a -lactam ring attached to a six-membered nuclear structure
(fi ve in penicillin), which allows synthetic modifi cation at two sites (one in penicil-
lin). This means that cephalosporins are the largest groups of available antibiotics.
Classifi cation into ‘generations’ is not standardized: as a rough rule, the higher the
generation, the wider the spectrum.
Carbapenems:
See table 9.5. Broadest spectrum of all -lactam antibiotics. Seek expert microbiol-
ogy advice before use.
Monobactam:
Aztreonam is only active against Gram-negative species including Neisseria men-
ingitidis, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Pseudomonas. Given IV/IM. Inhaled preparation
for chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas (cystic fi brosis). Dose adjust for renal function.
SEs: N&V, GI bleed, rash, LFTS, plts, paraesthesia, seizures, bronchospasm.
Non--lactam cell wall inhibitors
See fi g 9.4 and table 9.6. Includes glycopeptides, eg vancomycin, teicoplanin, and
polymyxins, eg colistin.
Inhibitors of protein synthesis
See fi g 9.4 and table 9.7. Includes:
• aminoglycosides
• macrolides
• tetracyclines and derivatives of tetracycline
• others: clindamycin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid.
Inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis
See fi g 9.4 and table 9.8. Includes:
• folate synthesis inhibitors: trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole
• fl uoroquinolones
• others: metronidazole, rifampicin.
Nitrofurantoin is unique. Metabolites interfere with cell growth via ribosomes, DNA,
RNA, and cell wall. Multiple sites of attack means resistance. Concentrates in the
urine (but not if GFR), used in uncomplicated UTI. SES: haemolysis, pulmonary fi brosis,
hepatotoxicity.

Gram-positive bacteria
Gram-positive cocci
Staphylococci:
Staphylococci are skin/nasal commensals in ~80% of adults. They can also cause
infectious disease. This produces a diagnostic challenge: are the detected organisms
causing infection or a contaminating commensal? The answer may lie in the pres-
ence or absence of coagulase, an enzyme which coagulates plasma.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci: eg Staphylococcus epidermidis are less viru-
lent. Pathogenicity is likely only if there is underlying immune system dysfunction or
foreign material (prosthetic valve/joint, IV line, PD catheter, pacemaker).
Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase positive. Presentation:
1 Toxin release causes disease distant from infection. Includes:
• scalded skin syndrome—bullae and desquamation due to epidermolytic toxins
(no mucosal disease, skin loss compared to toxic epidermal necrolysis)
• preformed toxin in food—sudden D&V (p428)
• toxic shock—fever, confusion, rash, diarrhoea, BP, AKI, multiorgan dysfunction.
Tampon associated or occurs with (minor) local infection.
2 Local tissue destruction: impetigo, cellulitis, mastitis, septic arthritis, osteomy-
elitis, abscess, pneumonia, UTI.
3 Haematogenous spread: bacteraemia, endocarditis, ‘metastatic’ seeding.
Diagnosis: positive culture from relevant site of infection. Treatment: Sepsis, see
p792. Drain infected foci, antibiotic (topical/oral/IV) based on illness severity and risk
factors. Consider local epidemiology of resistance. If systemic treatment indicated,
use -lactam whenever possible (may need to cover resistant strains until sensitiv-
ity available). Preformed toxin in food: supportive, antibiotics not usually indicated.
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus: MRSA, VISA, VRSA
Staph. aureus which produces -lactamase, or an altered enzyme responsible
for cell wall formation, will be resistant to -lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cepha-
losporins, carbapenems, see p385). Resistance is usually defi ned by stability to
meticillin, ie meticillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin resistance also
exists and is classifi ed according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit
bacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomy-
cin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA). Resistant staphylococci cause  morbidity
and mortality compared to sensitive strains. Risk factors for colonization include:
antibiotic exposure, hospital stay, surgery, nursing home residence. Treatment of
infection (not colonization): vancomycin (for MRSA), teicoplanin. Oral agents with
activity against MRSA include clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, linezolid.
Prevention: surveillance, barrier precautions, hand-hygiene, decolonization (mupi-
rocin 2%, chlorhexidine, tea tree oil), antimicrobial stewardship. See p384, pp410–11.
Streptococci:
Classifi cation based on Lancefi eld group persists in terminology (fi g 9.5). Includes:
• Streptococcus pyogenes (-haemolytic group A): colonizes throat, skin, anogenital
tract. Range of infection: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas,
cellulitis, pneumonia, peripartum sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis. All canstreptococcal
toxic shock = sudden-onset BP, multiorgan failure. Post-infectious complications
rare: rheumatic fever (p142), glomerulonephritis (p310). Treatment: penicillin.
• Streptococcus agalactiae (-haemolytic group B): neonatal and peurperal infec-
tion, skin, soft tissue. Invasive disease (bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis,
septic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: DM, malignancy, chronic dis-
ease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol.
• Streptococcus milleri: if found in blood culture look for an abscess—mouth, liver,
lung, brain. Treatment: penicillin.
• Streptococcus pneumoniae: pneumonia (pp166–8), otitis media, meningitis, septi-
caemia. Treatment: penicillin. Vaccination: childhood, hyposplenism, >65y (p407).
• Viridans streptococci: commonest cause of oral/dental origin endocarditis (p150).
• Streptococcus bovis: bacteraemiaendocarditis. Look for colon/liver disease.

Enterococci:
Gut commensal. Resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones leads to nosocomial
colonization and infection. Most common is Enterococcus faecalis: if found in blood
culture, assume endocarditis until proven otherwise. Treatment: intrinsic and acquired
resistance including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Seek expert help.
Gram-positive bacilli
Listeria:
Caused by Listeria monocytogenes which lives in soil. Able to multiply at low
temperatures. Found in pâté, raw vegetables/salad, unpasteurized milk/cheese.
Presentation: most asymptomatic, or mild fl u-like illness. In immunosuppressed
(including elderly): gastroenteritis, local infection (abscess, osteomyelitis, septic
arthritis, endocarditis, pneumonia), meningoencephalitis, life-threatening septi-
caemia. Listeria in pregnancy may cause mild disease in mother but transplacental
infectionplacentitis, amnionitis, preterm delivery, neonatal sepsis, intrauterine
death. Diagnosis: culture: blood, placenta, amniotic fl uid, CSF. PCR. Serology is non-
specifi c. Treatment: ampicillin plus gentamicin (synergistic action) for systemic
disease. Also co-trimoxazole (CNS disease), macrolides, tetracycline, rifampicin, van-
comycin, carbopenem. Resistant to cephalosporins which are often 1st-line empiri-
cal treatment for meningitis so remember additional antimicrobial cover if listeria
is a possibility.
Clostridia:
• Clostridium diffi cile, see p259, p411.
• Clostridium perfringens:
• Gastroenteritis, see p430.
• Gas gangrene due to exotoxin production (alpha toxin most common). Previ-
ously Clostridium welchii. Presentation: sudden, severe pain due to myonecro-
sis, tissue crepitus, systemic shock. Most post surgery (GI, biliary), or following
soft-tissue trauma/open fracture. If spontaneous, look for malignancy. Treat-
ment: early recognition, surgical debridement, protein synthesis inhibitors, eg
clindamycin inhibit toxins >penicillins. Hyperbaric O2 unproven in trials (fi g 9.4,
table 9.7).
• Clostridium botulinum, see p436.
• Clostridium tetani, see p436.
Diphtheria:
Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin. Preventable with vaccine. Pres-
entation: tonsillar pseudomembrane with fever, painful dysphagia, cervical lym-
phadenopathy (see OHCS p158). Diagnosis: culture, toxin detection, PCR. Treatment:
antitoxin within 48h. Benzylp enicillin/erythromycin. Airway support.
Actinomycosis:
Due to Actinomyces israelii, a mucous membrane commensal. Presentation: suba-
cute granulomatous/suppurative infection adjacent to mucous membrane. Diag-
nosis: culture. ‘Sulphur’ granules in pus/tissue are pathognomonic. Treatment:
antibiotics covering actinomycetes and concomitant microbes.
Nocardia:
Rare cause of disease. Presentation: tropical skin abscess, lung/brain abscess, dis-
seminated infection if immunosuppressed. Treatment: usually co-trimoxazole.
Anthrax: See p424.

ria. Mild disease presents with fever, macular rash (fi g 9.6) but no signs of shock.
High-grade meningococcaemia (~30% cases) causes pyrexia and septic shock
within 6–12h due to rapidly escalating endotoxin levels: circulatory failure, co-
agulopathy with skin haemorrhage (fi g 9.7), thrombosis of extremities/adrenals,
AKI, ARDS. Meningism may be absent. Complications: amputation, skin necrosis,
pericarditis, arthritis, ocular infection, pneumonia (especially serotypes Y and W),
permanent adrenal insuffi ciency.

Diagnosis: Start treatment immediately if meningitis/meningococcal sepsis is
a possible diagnosis. Do not wait for confi rmation: delay can be deadly. Intra- and
extracellular diplococci on microscopy of CSF/blood/skin lesion. PCR of CSF/blood/
skin lesion. Treatment: urgent antibiotic treatment: benzylpenicillin, ceftriaxone (see
pp822–3). Cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, meropenem also bactericidal. Prevention:
routine infant vaccination against capsular group C in UK. Capsular group B vaccine in
UK infants since 2015: induces bacteriocidal antibodies, no population data, duration
of protection unknown. Quadrivalent ACWY vaccine at age 14 and if high-risk travel.
Additional B, C, ACWY doses if hyposplenism and complement defi ciency. Prophylaxis
of contacts: ciprofl oxacin/ceftriaxone (single dose), or rifampicin 600mg BD for 48h.
Neisseria gonorrhoea: see pp412–3.
Moraxella catarrhalis:
Colonizes upper respiratory tract in children ( in adults). Resembles Neisseria com-
mensal so may be overlooked. Presentation: pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, up to
20% of acute otitis media, sinusitis. Bacteraemia is rare. Diagnosis: culture of sputum,
ear eff usion, sinus aspirate, blood. ‘Hockey puck sign’: colonies can be pushed along
agar surface without disruption. Treatment: macrolide, cephalosporin.

Gram-negative bacilli
Enterobacteriaceae:
Enterobacteriaceae family is large: >50 genera, >170 named species. In the clinical
setting, 3 species make up 80–95% of isolates:
1 Escherichia coli: part of normal colonic fl ora. Pathogenic forms can cause:
Intestinal disease:
Enterotoxigenic: a major cause of traveller’s diarrhoea (pp428–9).
Enterohaemorrhagic: diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis eg O157:H7 (p431).
Enteropathogenic: infants in areas of poor sanitation.
Enteroinvasive: dysentery-like syndrome.
Enteroadherent: traveller’s diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea in children/HIV.
Extra-intestinal disease: usually patient’s own fl ora that is not pathogenic in the
intestine but causes disease elsewhere: UTI (pp296–7); neonatal meningitis; noso-
comial infection: pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis. Treat according to sensitivity:
trimethoprim, ampicillin, cephalosporin, ciprofl oxacin, aminoglycoside.
2 Klebsiella pneumoniae: colonizes skin, nasopharynx, GI tract, hospitalized
patients. Associated with antibiotic exposure, in-dwelling catheters, immuno-
suppression. Causes pneumonia (necrotizing disease and sepsis if immunosup-
pressed). Also UTI, nasopharyngeal infl ammation. Treat according to sensitivity:
aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, carbapenem, quinolone.
3 Proteus mirabilis: gut commensal. Causes UTI (pp296–7). Stone formation due
to urease production: breaks down urea to produce ammonia, struvite stones
(‘infection stones’) then form in the presence of magnesium, calcium, and phos-
phate (pp638–9).
Other Enterobacteriaceae include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia: see enteric fever
(p415), gastroenteritis (pp428–31), plague (p425).
Resistance: widespread antibiotic use has led to the development of highly virulent,
multiple resistant E. coli and Klebsiella species including:
• extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Resistant to
penicillins, cephalosporins, fl uoroquinolones, trimethoprim, tetracycline, with pos-
sible extension to other antibiotic groups
• carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).
Resistance requires antimicrobial stewardship (p384), surveillance, robust infection
control, research into resistance risk and transmission (p383).
Pseudomonas aeruginosa:
Found in environment. Spread by contact/ingestion. Presentation: important cause
of nosocomial infection. Infection if compromised tissue, eg wound, pneumonia
with lung disease or ventilation, UTI with catheterization. Septicaemia if immuno-
suppressed. Treatment: options include ceftazidime/carbapenem, aminoglycoside,
colistin. Combination may be needed. Impermeability of membrane and biofi lm colo-
nization lead to antibiotic resistance. Multidrug-resistance. Seek expert help.
Haemophilus infl uenzae:
Divided into encapsulated, typeable forms (a-f); and unencapsulated, non-typeable
forms. Upper respiratory tract carriage, transmitted by droplets. H. infl uenzae b
(Hib) causes meningitis, epiglottitis, otitis media, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic ar-
thritis, and bacteraemia. Fatal in ~5%. Routine immunization in childhood and sple-
nectomy/hyposplenism (p407). Non-typeable forms cause pneumonia and sinusitis.
Treatment: amoxicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin.
Whooping cough:
Bordetella pertussis. Presentation: catarrhal phase 1–2wk, then paroxysmal cough-
ing. ‘Whoop’ is a breath through partially closed vocal cords, seen mainly in children.
Cough is prolonged (‘100 day cough’). Infants have complications/mortality. Diag-
nosis: PCR nasal/throat swab. Culture sensitivity 10–60%. Treatment: macrolides
infectivity, but may not alter disease course. Routine childhood vaccination. Vac-
cination in pregnancy placental antibody transfer to protect neonate (p407).
Other:
Brucellosis (p424), cholera (p430), melioidosis (p414).

Tuberculosis (TB): presentation
Epidemiology
• 9.6 million new cases/yr of which 37% are unreported/undiagnosed (fi g 9.8).
• 3.3% of new cases, and 20% of previously treated cases are drug resistant (p395).
• Co-infection with HIV in 12% of new cases.
• Leading cause of death worldwide, 1.5 million deaths/yr.
• Eff ective diagnosis and treatment saved 43 million lives between 2000 and 2014.
• UK: ~8000/yr, ~12 per 100 000. 73% born outside UK, 70% in deprived areas, 30% with
pulmonary disease wait >4 months from symptoms to treatment.

Pathophysiology
Caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Active infection occurs when containment by the immune system (T-cells/mac-
rophages) is inadequate. It can arise from primary infection, or re-activation of
previously latent disease. Transmission of TB is via inhalation of aerosol droplets
containing bacterium. This means only pulmonary disease is communicable.
Latent TB is infection without disease due to persistent immune system containment
(ie granuloma formation prevents bacteria growth and spread). Positive skin/blood
testing (p394) shows evidence of infection but the patient is asymptomatic and non-
infectious (normal sputum/CXR). ~2 billion persons worldwide (~⅓ of world’s popula-
tion) are estimated to have latent TB. Lifetime risk of reactivation is 5–10%. Risk
factors for reactivation: new infection (<2y), HIV, organ transplantation, immunosup-
pression (including corticosteroids), silicosis, illicit drug use, malnutrition, high-risk
settings (homeless shelter, prison), low socio-economic status, haemodialysis.

Clinical features of TB
• Systemic features: Low-grade fever, anorexia, weight loss, malaise, night
sweats, clubbing (bronchiectasis), erythema nodosum (p562).
• Pulmonary TB: Cough (in ~50%, >2–3 weeks, dry then productive), pleurisy,
haemoptysis (uncommon, seen with bronchiectasis  not always active disease),
pleural eff usion. An aspergilloma/mycetoma (p177) may form in the cavities.
Presentation varies and may be silent or atypical, especially with immunosup-
pression, eg HIV, post-transplantation.
• Tuberculous lymphadenitis: (Usually) painless enlargement of cervical or su-
praclavicular lymph nodes. Axillary and inguinal node involvement less common.
Coexisting systemic symptoms in 40–50%. Node is typically fi rm to touch and
not acutely infl amed (‘cold abscess’). Skin can adhere to the underlying mass
with risk of rupture and sinus formation. Can occur with or without pulmonary
disease. Investigate with fi ne-needle aspiration, AFB staining, and culture (p394).
• Gastrointestinal TB: Most disease is ileocaecal. Causes colicky abdominal pain
and vomiting. Bowel obstruction can occur due to bowel wall thickening, stric-
ture formation, or infl ammatory adhesions. Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Ca-
seation necrosis and an absence of transmural cracks/fi ssures distinguish from
Crohn’s disease.
• Spinal TB: Local pain and bony tenderness for weeks–months. Slow, insidious
progression. May not present until deformity or neurological symptoms. Look
for bony destruction, vertebral collapse, and soft tissue abscess (see Pott’s ver-
tebra p708).
• Miliary TB: Haematogenous dissemi-
nation leads to the formation of dis-
crete foci (~2mm) of granulomatous
tissue throughout the lung (‘millet’
seed appearance). CXR: fi g 9.9. Dis-
semination is throughout the body
with meningeal involvement in ~25%.
Sputum may be negative for AFB as
spread is haematogenous. Have a low
threshold for LP. Untreated mortality
is assumed to be close to 100%. Do not
delay treatment while test results are
pending.
• CNS TB: Haematogenous spread lead-
ing to foci of infection in brain and Fig 9.9 Miliary TB (nodular opacities).

meningitis. Risk with immune suppression, HIV, aged <3y. Headache, meningism,
confusion, seizures, focal neurological defi cit, and systemic symptoms. Needs LP
and examination of CSF (leucocytosis, raised protein, CSF: plasma glucose <50%,
AFB stain, PCR and culture). Look for TB elsewhere (CXR, etc), test for HIV. CT/
MRI may show hydrocephalus, basal exudates. Tuberculomas are ring-enhancing.
All rapid diagnostic tests (p394) have sensitivity, so treat on suspicion.
• Genitourinary TB: Symptoms may be chronic, intermittent, or silent. Include
dysuria, freque ncy, loin pain, haematuria, sterile pyuria (see p296). Granuloma
may cause fi brosis, strictures, infertility, and genital ulceration.
• Cardiac TB: Usually involves the pericardium: pericarditis, pericardial eff usion,
and/or constrictive pericarditis (p154). Check chest imaging for other TB pathol-
ogy, eg pulmonary disease, mediastinal lymph nodes. Pericardiectomy may be
indicated for persistent constriction despite anti-tuberculous treatment. Myo-
cardial involvement (arrhythmias, heart failure, ventricular aneurysm, or outfl ow
obstruction) is rare.
• Skin: Lupus vulgaris = persistent, progressive, cutaneous TB: red-brown, ‘apple-
jelly’ nodules. Scrofuloderma: skin lesion extended from underlying infection eg
lymph node, bone; causes ulceration and scarring.

Tuberculosis (TB): diagnosis and treatment
Diagnostic tests for TB
Latent TB:
Off er testing3 to close contacts of those with pulmonary or laryngeal TB, those
with immune dysfunction, healthcare workers, and high-risk populations, eg pris-
on, homeless, vulnerable migrants.
• Tuberculin skin testing (TST) = Mantoux test. Intradermal injection of purifi ed
protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin. Size of skin induration is used to determine
positivity depending on vaccination history and immune status (>5mm if risk
factors, >15mm if no risk factors).
• Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAS) diagnose exposure to TB by meas-
uring the release of interferon-gamma from T-cells reacting to TB antigen.
Specifi city compared to TST if history of BCG vaccination.
Neither test can diagnose or exclude active disease (falsely negative in 20–25%
of active disease): clinical evaluation is required.
Immune-suppressed states reduce the sensitivity of both tests.
Active pulmonary TB:
• CXR. Fibronodular/linear opacities in upper lobe (typical), middle or lower lobes
(atypical), cavitation, calcifi cation, miliary disease (see fi g 9.9), eff usion, lym-
phadenopathy.
• Sputum smear. Sputum can be spontaneously produced or induced (with nebu-
lized saline and precautions to prevent transmission). Three specimens are need-
ed including an early-morning sample. It is stained for the presence of acid-fast
bacilli (AFB). All mycobacteria are ‘acid-fast’ including M. tuberculosis. If AFB are
seen, treatment should be commenced and the patient isolated (in hospital only
if clinical indication, or public health reason for admission; or at home).
• Sputum culture. More sensitive than smear testing. Culture takes 1–3 weeks
(liquid media) or 4–8 weeks (solid media). Can assess drug sensitivity.
• Nucleic acid amplifi cation test (NAAT). Direct detection of M. tuberculosis in
sputum by DNA or RNA amplifi cation. Rapid diagnosis (<8hrs). Can also detect
drug resistance (see p395).
Extra-pulmonary TB:
• Investigate for coexisting pulmonary disease.
• Obtain material from aspiration or biopsy (lymph node, pleura, bone, synovium,
GI/GU tract) to enable AFB staining, histological examination (caseating granu-
loma) and/or culture.
• NAAT can be carried out on any sterile body fl uid, eg CSF, pericardial fl uid.
Offer HIV test for all.

Latent TB
Balance the risk of development of active disease with the possible side-eff ects of
treatment. Consider treatment in all at risk of active disease: HIV, transplantation,
chemotherapy, biological agents eg anti-TNF (see p265), diabetes, CKD including di-
alysis, silicosis, bariatric surgery, and recent close contact with pulmonary/laryngeal
TB. Off er HIV, hepatitis B and C testing prior to treatment.
Treat with 3 months of isoniazid (with pyridoxine) and rifampicin OR 6 months of
isoniazid (with pyridoxine).
If concerns about hepatotoxicity then 3 months of isoniazid and rifampicin may be
preferred. In severe liver disease, seek specialist advice. If interactions with rifamy-
cins are a concern (eg HIV, transplant) then 6 months of isoniazid may be preferred.
Active TB
All forms of active TB are statutorily notifi able in UK. This includes both clinical and
culture diagnoses. Notifi cation is via your local public health protection team (www.
gov.uk/health-protection-team).Treatment is given under the care of a specialist TB clini-
cian/service according to table 9.10. Exceptions include:
• active CNS disease (including spinal cord involvement): continuation phase of treat-
ment is extended from 4 to 10 months
• CNS and pericardial disease: use adjunctive high-dose steroids (with weaning and
withdrawal during the intensive treatment period)
• drug-resistant TB.
Adherence is important for treatment to be eff ective and to prevent drug resistance.
Directly observed therapy (DOT) should be considered if: previous treatment for TB,
homelessness, drug/alcohol misuse, prison, psychiatric or cognitive disorder, multi-
drug resistant disease, patient request.
Universal access to diagnosis and treatment of TB is part of social justice. WHO has
developed an ‘End TB’ strategy aiming to reduce TB deaths by 90% by 2030, and TB
incidence by 90% by 2035 (www.who.int/tb/strategy/en).
Drug-resistant TB
NAAT (p394) for drug resistance should be requested for all patients with risk fac-
tors for drug-resistance: previous TB treatment, contact with drug-resistant disease,
birth or residence in a country where ≥5% new cases are drug resistant (fi g 9.10).
Drug resistance may be:
• to any single agent in table 9.10.
• multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid.
• extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, one inject-
able agent (capreomycin, kanamycin or amikacin) and one fl uoroquinolone.
If rifampicin resistance is detected, treat with at least six agents to which the my-
cobacterium is likely to be sensitive. Test for resistance to 2nd-line drugs. Remember
infection control measures. Seek expert advice for all drug-resistant cases.

Infl uenza
Infl uenza is common throughout the world, aff ecting ~5–10% of adults, and 20–30%
of children each year. In most, it is a self-limiting illness. Complications can be life-
threatening in the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic disease. There
are ~4 million cases of severe infl uenza and ~500 000 deaths worldwide/yr.
Seasonal infl uenza
Acute viral infection of lungs and airways. Rapid person-to-person spread by aero-
solized droplets and contact. Infectivity from 1d prior, to ~7d after symptoms. In-
cludes three subtypes of virus: A, B, and C. Type A infl uenza is subdivided according
to combinations of virus surface proteins eg A(H1N1), A(H3N2). Seasonal epidemics
peak during the winter in temperate countries. Acquired immunity is specifi c to
the virus subtype.
Presentation: Incubation: 1–4d. Fever, dry cough, sore throat, coryzal symptoms,
headache, malaise, myalgia, conjunctivitis, eye pain ± photophobia. Complications
include pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic lung disease, croup, otitis media, D&V,
myositis, encephalitis, Reye syndrome (encephalopathy + fatty degenerative liver
failure).
Diagnosis: Clinical: acute onset + cough + fever has positive predictive value >79%.
Testing limited to outbreaks, and public health surveillance. Includes: viral PCR, rapid
antigen testing, viral culture of clinical samples (throat swab, nasal swab, naso-
pharyngeal washings, sputum).
Treatment:
• Uncomplicated infl uenza symptomatic treatment eg paracetamol. Antivirals only
if high risk:
• Chronic disease: lung, heart, kidney, liver, CNS, DM
• Immunosuppression: immunodefi ciency, current or planned or within 6
months of immunosuppressive therapy, CD4 (<200 in adults, <500 if child <5yr)
• Pregnancy • >65yr
• BMI>40 • <6 months old.
• Complicated infl uenza includes lower respiratory tract infection, exacerbation of
any underlying medical condition, all needing hospital admission. Give antiviral4
inhibitors of infl uenza neuraminidase:
1 Oseltamivir:P O or NG. Adult dose: 75mg BD. 5d course. 1st line in UK.
2 Zanamivir: inhaled (10mg BD, 5d course, confi rm technique), nebulized, or IV (res-
piratory disease aff ecting nebulizer delivery, ITU). Used if: oseltamivir resistance
(eg A(H1N1)), poor clinical response to oseltamivir, concerns re GI absorption of
oseltamivir.
Retrospective observational data, and animal studies of oseltamivir and zanamivir
show no evidence of harm in pregnancy. Supportive treatment for all. Extracorpor-
eal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to support gas exchange in severe
acute lung injury due to infl uenza.
Prevention:
• Post-exposure prophylaxis: if high risk (see ‘Treatment’) AND not protected by vac-
cination: oseltamivir PO OD (inhaled zanamivir OD if oseltamivir resistance) for 10d.
• Annual vaccination in UK: all high risk (see ‘Treatment’), children>2yrs, healthcare
workers. See p407.
Pandemic infl uenza
Seasonal infl uenza is subject to antigenic drift: small genetic changes during repli-
cation which can be accounted for in the annual vaccine. Antigenic shift is a major
change in infl uenza A resulting in new haemgglutinin (H) and neuraminidase pro-
teins (N) for which there is no pre-existing immunity in the population. Any non-
human infl uenza viruses which transfer to humans are novel. If they also have, or
develop, capacity for rapid human-to-human transmission a pandemic results.
Based on previous pandemics, up to 50% of the UK population may become in-
fected leading to 20 000–750 000 excess deaths.

Sailing the choppy waters of pandemic infl uenza
Pandemic infl uenza is the stormy sea of clinical medicine. Like sailors, we know
there are deadly challenges to come, but we cannot predict their exact timing
or nature. To prepare a boat for the tempestuous waters ahead, the mast is key;
without it the sails are unsupported and progress will fl ounder. The mast of pan-
demic infl uenza is a tall, vertical spar which produces maximum drive through
the swell, and allows sailors to climb up high to see what the horizon has in store.
When preparing for pandemic infl uenza, we must make for ourselves a spar of
principles and plans fi t for the storm ahead:
• Surveillance, planning, and communication: worldwide infl uenza virological sur-
veillance has been conducted through the WHO for >50yr. It off ers a global alert
mechanism for viruses with pandemic potential and defi nes methodologies for
assessing antiviral susceptibility. Cooperation between international and nation-
al public health bodies is required for an understanding of clinical characteristics
and disease spread. Communication to the individual (public and social media)
is needed with advice about self-isolation, when and how to seek medical help,
personal hygiene.
• Protect: vaccine development and production capacity (stockpiling), adequate
personal protective equipment (apron, gloves, well-fi tting mask), antiviral ad-
ministration according to robust evidence and sensitivity.
• Animals: limiting/eliminating the animal reservoir of virus by culling, restricting
animal movement, vaccination of livestock.
• Research: virus characteristics, disease severity predictors, epidemiological
risk factors, antiviral development, targeting of treatment and vaccination,
increased-spectrum vaccines with longer-lasting immunity, eff ective healthcare
worker protection, evidence-based social distancing measures.
Hide and seek
In 2009, there was justifi able global concern about a ‘swine fl u’ pandemic. Based
on a Cochrane review in 2008, which showed reduced complications with os-
eltamivir, billions were spent stockpiling the drug worldwide.
In fact, the positive conclusion was driven mainly by data from an industry-funded
summary of 10 trials, of which only two had been published.5 Cochrane needed ac-
cess to these missing data. The ensuing fi ght for information was to take 5 years.
The off er of a secret contract, with secret terms, and secrecy about methods, was
declined. These are not acceptable methods for meta-analysis. Inconsistencies be-
gan to arise in conclusions about eff ectiveness. Were people seeing diff erent data,
or was this simply a close call with two sides separated by a very small fence? Either
way, being able to see all the data started to become increasingly important. But
even the largest phase three trial of the drug had never been published. And was
self-reported pneumonia a useful outcome measure? In December 2009, Cochrane
could only declare that paucity of data undermined previous fi ndings.
This battle for data became part of ‘Alltrials’: a campaign for transparency in
clinical trials. ~50% of all clinical trials remain unpublished. The hunt goes on to
fi nd them. You can run your own drug trial, choose what to publish, and watch
how the data become skewed at: www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias.
After half a decade, under ceaseless demand, and with the withholding of data
become increasingly indefensible, the clinical study reports were released. These
are normally used to provide authorities with a detailed trial report. They are not
easy fodder for meta-analysis. Assessing 160 000 pages was uncharted territory
for Cochrane. And the conclusion: oseltamivir shortens symptoms by <1d and hos-
pitalization is not reduced. Other complications were unreliably reported.
The WHO includes oseltamivir on its WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th
edition, 2015) which means it is considered effi cacious, safe, cost-eff ective, and a
minimum requirement for basic healthcare. Does this stand up to independent
scrutiny? The evidence base is certainly tarnished. But a pandemic is not a RCT.
And the threshold of evidence to reverse policy decisions may be diff erent from
the threshold needed to introduce them. If a new pandemic looms, millions more
will be thrown in, for now.

Human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV): diagnosis
HIV is a retrovirus which infects and replicates in human lymphocytes (CD4 + T-cells)
and macrophages. This leads to progressive immune system dysfunction, opportun-
istic infection, and malignancy = Acquired Immunodefi ciency Syndrome (AIDS). The
virus is transmitted via blood, sexual fl uids, and breast milk. Virus subtypes include
HIV1 (global epidemic) and HIV2 ( pathogenic, predominantly West Africa).
Epidemiology
~37 million adults and children are estimated to be living with HIV worldwide (fi g
9.11), with 1.2 million deaths/yr. Africa has most of the disease (~26 million), most
of the mortality (790 000/yr), and ~1% of the world’s wealth.
UK: estimated ~100 000 living with HIV (=1.9/1000) including 5% of men who have sex
with men (MSM). ~17% of those with HIV in UK are unaware of their infection.

Pathophysiology
HIV binds, via its GP120 envelope glycoprotein, to CD4 receptors on helper T cells,
monocytes, and macrophages. These ‘CD4 cells’ migrate to lymphoid tissue where
the virus replicates, producing billions of new virions. These are released, and in turn
infect new CD4 cells. As infection progresses, depletion or impaired function of CD4
cells leads to immune function. HIV is a retrovirus: it encodes reverse transcriptase,
allowing DNA copies to be produced from viral RNA. This is error prone, meaning a
signifi cant mutation rate, which contributes to treatment resistance.
Prevention
Sexual transmission: Consistent and correct use of (male and female) condoms
 transmission by ~90%. Serosorting is the restriction of (unprotected) sex depend-
ing on HIV status. It is unsafe due to inaccuracies in HIV status (which is only as
reliable as a person’s last test) and failure to disclose. It does not consider transfer of
treatment resistance, other STIs, or hepatitis.
Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): The short-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
after potential HIV exposure (sexual or occupational) should be considered an emer-
gency method of HIV prevention. Can be given up to 72h (ideally <24h) after exposure.
Not recommended if exposure is to a person on ART with a confi rmed and sustained
(>6 months) undetectable (<200 copies/mL) viral load. 1st-line PEP6 in UK is Truvada®
(tenofovir/emtricitabine) and raltegravir for 28 days (2015) (refer to local guidelines).
Test for HIV 8–12 weeks after exposure.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): The use of ART in those at high risk of acquiring HIV
including serodiff erent relationships without suppression of viral load, condomless
anal sex in MSM. Trials (PROUD, IPERGAY) show an 86% reduction in HIV incidence. A
large scale trial of PrEP provision (2017–2020) will inform future NHS funding decisions.
Vertical transmission: All pregnant women with HIV should have commenced ART
by 24 weeks’ gestation. Caesarean delivery indicated if viral load >50 copies/mL.
Neonatal PEP is given from birth to 4wks old with formula-feeding.

Presentation
With symptoms of early HIV infection:
• Primary HIV infection is symptomatic in ~80%, typically 2–4 weeks after infec-
tion (= seroconversion illness, acute retroviral syndrome). Maintain a high index of
suspicion. Off er HIV testing to anyone (regardless of risk) presenting with fl u-like
symptoms and an eythematous/maculopapular rash. Consider primary HIV as a
diff erential in any combination of fever, rash, myalgia, pharyngitis, mucosal ulcera-
tion, lymphadenopathy, and headache/aseptic meningitis. Diagnosis of primary HIV
is a unique opportunity to prevent transmission (viral load and genital shedding).
HIV antibody testing may be negative but HIV RNA levels are high—seek expert help
regarding viral load testing (see HIV testing later in topic).
• Persistant generalized lymphadenopathy = swollen/enlarged lymph nodes >1cm
in two or more non-contiguous sites (not inguinal) persisting for >3 months. Due to
follicular hyperplasia caused by HIV infection. Exclude TB, infection, and malignancy.
In the asymptomatic, latent phase of chronic HIV infection:
In the UK there is universal testing in sexual health clinics, antenatal services, drug
dependency programmes, and in patients with TB/hepatitis B/hepatitis C/lymphoma.
Where HIV prevalence is >2/1000 universal testing by GPs and medical admissions
units should be considered. Any request for a HIV test should be met.
With complications of immune system dysfunction: See pp400–1.
HIV testing
The prognosis for patients with HIV in the UK is much better than for many other serious
illness for which doctors routinely test. HIV testing6 should not be viewed diff erently. Any
doctor can consent for a HIV test: explain the benefi ts of testing and detail how results
will be given. Written consent is unnecessary. Arrange follow-up with a local HIV/GUM
service within 2 weeks (preferably <48h) for patients testing positive for the fi rst time.
• ELISA for HIV antibody and antigen (p24): 4th-generation assays test for HIV an-
tibody and p24 antigen. This reduces the ‘window period’ (time of false-negative
testing between infection and the production of measurable antigen/antibody) to
average ~10 days. Diagnosis in UK is confi rmed by a confi rmatory assay.
• Rapid point-of-care testing: Immunoassay kit which gives a rapid result from a
fi nger-prick or mouth swab. Only CE-marked kits should be used. Needs serological
confi rmation.
• Viral load: Quantifi cation of HIV RNA. Used to monitor response to ART. Not diag-
nostic due to possibility of a false-positive result  care if used to test for sympto-
matic primary HIV in the ‘window period’—confi rmation of seroconversion is still
required.
• Nucleic acid testing/viral PCR: Qualitative test for the presence of viral RNA. Used
to test for vertical transmission in neonates as placental transfer of maternal anti-
bodies can aff ect ELISA antibody testing up to 18 months of age.
• CD4 count: Cannot diagnose HIV. Used to monitor immune system function and
disease progression in patients with HIV. <200 cells/microlitre is one of the defi ning
criteria for AIDS.
See www.aidsmap.com for available HIV testing and country-specifi c resources.
Needle-stick injury
Risk of HIV transmission from a single needle-stick exposure from a person with
HIV not on ART is ~1 in 300 (lower than risks of hepatitis B and C transmission).
Prevent:
• Use ‘safer sharps’ (incorporates a mechanism to minimize accidental injury).
• Do not recap unprotected medical sharps.
• When using sharps, ensure there is a disposal container nearby.
Manage:
• Encourage the wound to bleed, ideally under running water (do not suck).
• Wash with soap and running water, do not scrub.
• Seek advice from occupational health/infection control (or A&E outside of work-
ing hours) regarding source testing and post-exposure prophylaxis (p398).

Complications of HIV infection
Complications of HIV can be divided into:
• complications of immune dysfunction (opportunistic infection/malignancy)
• complicating comorbidity
• complications of treatment, ie adverse drug eff ects (see pp402–3).
The diff erential diagnosis for symptoms presenting in a person with HIV is given in
table 9.11. This is not exhaustive. Do not forget your usual diff erentials, the presen-
tation may not relate to the patient’s HIV status.
Opportunistic disease
ART is part of the treatment regimen of all opportunistic infections (see pp402–3).
• Pneumocystis jirovecii: (‘yee-row-vet-zee’) Presentation: progressive SOB on
exertion, malaise, dry cough. Haemoptysis and pleuritic pain rare. Examination:
respiratory rate, often normal breath sounds. Investigation: SpO 2 (compare rest
and exertion). CXR: classically perihilar infi ltrates (fi g 9.12), but may be normal. In-
duced sputum or BAL with staining or nucleic acid amplifi cation. Treatment: IV
co-trimoxazole (convert to oral if favourable response). 21-day course. Steroids in
moderate–severe disease (PO<9.3KPa/SpO<92%). 2nd-line: clindamycin, penta-
a 2 2
midine, atovaquone. Prophylaxis: co-trimoxazole if CD4 <200 cells/microlitre.
• Candidiasis: Oral or oesophageal. Pain in the tongue, dysphagia, odynophagia. Di-
agnosed clinically or endoscopically. Treated with systemic ‘-azole’, eg fl uconazole.
• Cryptococcus neoformans: Commonest systemic fungal infection in HIV (5–10%
pre-ART). Presentation: meningitis: headache, fever, meningism variable. May be
associated skin (molluscum-like papules) and lung disease. Investigation: LP with
manometry. CSF stain (India ink), CSF/blood cryptococcal antigen. Treatment: in-
duction with liposomal amphotericin B (SE: renal tubular damage and AKI). Addition
of fl ucytosine has shown benefi t in patients not on ART (SE: haematological toxic-
ity). Maintenance treatment with fl uconazole. Normalize ICP with repeat LPs/shunt.
• Toxoplasma gondii: Toxoplasma abscesses are commonest cause of intracranial
mass lesions when CD4 <200 cells/microlitre. Presentation: focal neurological signs
± seizures. Headache and vomiting if raised ICP. Investigation: ring-enhancing le-
sions on MRI ( lymphoma) with associated oedema. CSF PCR for T. gondii is spe-
cifi c but only moderately sensitive. Blood serology is not diagnostic as most cases
are a reactivation of previous infection. Treatment: consider in any brain mass
lesion with CD4 <200 cell/microlitre. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid.
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Severe primary or reactivated disease (see p405). Presen-
tation: retinitis (blurred then loss of vision), encephalitis, GI disease (oesophagitis,
colitis), hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, pneumonia. Diagnosis: serial CMV viral
load, retinal lesions (p438), GI ulceration, ‘owl’s eye’ inclusions on biopsy. Treatment:
ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Side-eff ects: rash, diarrhoea, bone myelosuppression.
• Cryptosporidium: Common cause of chronic diarrhoea in HIV pre-ART. Presen-
tation: acute or sub-acute non-bloody, watery diarrhoea. Also cholangitis, pan-
creatitis. Investigation: stool microscopy (multiple samples as oocyst excretion
intermittent), PCR, enzyme immunoassay, direct fl uorescent antibody. Treatment:
supportive, ART.
• Kaposi’s sarcoma: Most common tumour in HIV and AIDS defi ning. Caused by Ka-
posi sarcoma herpes virus (human herpesvirus 8, p405). Presentation: cutaneous
or mucosal lesions: patch, plaque, or nodular. Visceral disease less common. In-
vestigation: histological confi rmation. Treatment: ART. Intralesional retinoids or
vinblastine. Radiotherapy for cosmesis/pain. Chemotherapy (+ART) in advanced
disease.
• Lymphoma: Increased risk of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in HIV. Includes: diff use
large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma. Presentation:
dependent upon area of involvement. Includes lymphadenopathy, cytopenia, CNS
symptoms. Treatment: combined ART and chemotherapy. Rituximab for non-CNS
disease. Whole-brain radiotherapy for CNS disease if excess toxicity with chemo-
therapy.

permission from Oxford University Press.
Complicating comorbidity
• Cardiovascular disease: Increased risk of CVD in HIV. Includes individuals where
risk traditionally lower: younger age, normotensive, no DM, non-obese. Contrib-
uting factors: dyslipidaemia caused by ART, acceleration of pro-atherosclerotic
infl ammatory processes by HIV. Management of CV risk factors although no out-
come data to guide specifi c lipid and BP targets in HIV.
• Bone disease: Increased risk of low bone-mineral density and fragility fractures
in HIV. Contributing factors: side eff ect of ART, increased prevalence of risk fac-
tors, eg poor nutrition, smoking, alcohol, low vitamin D levels. Risk assess and
consider bisphosphonate.
• TB: All patients with TB and HIV need ART (as soon as TB treatment tolerated and
within 2 weeks if CD4 <100 cells/microlitre). Seek expert advice and refer to local
guidelines. Consider Truvada® plus efavirenz as 1st line in UK (serum levels of
integrase inhibitors are decreased by rifampicin). See ART, pp402–3, TB, pp394–5.
• Hepatitis B (HBV): Co-infection requires an ART regimen including antivirals with
anti-HBV activity, eg tenofovir plus emtricitabine (not lamivudine or emtricit-
abine as a single agent due to potential for emergence of HBV resistance).
• Hepatitis C (HCV): Assess all with HIV for HCV treatment. Pegylated interferon effi -
cacy is less with lower CD4 count. Aim for CD4 >500 cells/microlitre with ART fi rst.

HIV: antiretroviral therapy (ART)
 Antiretroviral therapy (ART)7 is recommended for everyone with HIV, regardless
of CD4 count.
Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, 2015
4685 participants (215 sites, 35 countries) with HIV, CD4 >500 cells/microlitre, no
previous ART. Randomized to:
• immediate ART
• deferred ART until CD4 <350 cells/microlitre or AIDS-defi ning illness.
Study was terminated early when an independent interim analysis revealed ben-
efi t to immediate initiation of ART, and recommended that patients on the deferred
group start ART. Immediate initiation of ART reduced the risk of AIDS, serious
non-AIDS events, or death by 57% (CI 38–70%) at 3 years.
Aims of ART To reduce the HIV viral load to a level undetectable by standard labora-
tory techniques leading to immunological recovery, reduced clinical progression, and
reduced mortality. These aims should be met with the least possible side-eff ects.
Mechanism of action (See fi g 9.13.)
• CCR5 antagonists inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell by blocking the CCR5
co-receptor.
• Nucleos(t)ide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, NNR-
TIs) inhibit reverse transcriptase and the conversion of viral RNA into DNA.
• Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit integrase and prevent HIV DNA
integrating into the nucleus.
• Protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit protease, an enzyme involved in the maturation
of virus particles.
• Pharmacokinetic enhancers/boosters increase the eff ectiveness of antiretroviral
drugs allowing lower doses eg cobicistat, ritonavir.

1 Counselling: HIV transmission and sexual health, benefi ts of therapy (not cure),
adherence (life long), resistance, side-eff ects of treatment, necessary monitor-
ing, disclosure to partner/family/friends, partner testing.
2 Screen for infections and malignancy (pp400–1). Includes TB, hepatitis B&C. Treat
or off er prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole if CD4 <200 cells/microlitre. For latent TB
see p395. Aim to start ART within 2 weeks of initiation of antimicrobial treatment
for opportunistic or serious infection (seek expert advice if drug interactions or
intracerebral disease).
3 Baseline tests: CD4, viral load, FBC, LFT, electrolytes, creatinine, pregnancy test,
viral genotype for drug resistance.
4 Review usual medications for possible drug interactions. Advise the patient to
check for drug interactions with any new medication.

What to start
Use local guidelines. Get expert help.
For a treatment-naive patient consider two nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-
hibitors (=’NRTI backbone’) plus one of:
• ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor
• non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
• integrase inhibitor.
1st line drugs commonly used in the UK include:
• NRTI backbone: Tenofovir and emtricitabine (combination tablet=Truvada®),
abacavir and lamivudine (combination tablet=Kivexa®). Side-eff ects: GI distur-
bance, anorexia, pancreatitis, hepatic dysfunction (severe lactic acidosis with
hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis reported, caution with hepatitis B/C), bone-
mineral density. Avoid abacavir if high risk of CVD. Avoid tenofovir if eGFR <30.
• Protease inhibitors: Atazanavir, darunavir. Side-eff ects: hyperglycaemia, insulin
resistance (mainly 1st-generation drugs), dyslipidaemia, jaundice, and hepatitis.
• NNTRI: Rilpivirine (give with food, interaction with proton pump inhibitors), efa-
virenz (CNS toxicity, association with suicidality  care in depression/anxiety,
adverse lipid profi le). Other side-eff ects: rash, GI disturbance.
• Integrase inhibitor: Dolutegravir, elvitegravir, raltegravir. Side-eff ects: rash, GI
disturbance, insomnia.
Monitor: adherence (see BOX ‘Adherence’), adverse eff ects (LFTs, glucose), virologi-
cal response (viral load). CD4 counts guide prophylaxis of opportunistic infection
(values may not correlate with virological response, use viral load preferentially).
Adherence
Adherence to ART is associated with drug resistance, disease progression, and
death. Adherence support should be integral to ART provision.
Assess: Ask about adherence in a non-judgemental way. Do not blame. Explain the
reasoning behind your questions. Is non-adherence due to practical problems or
healthcare beliefs? Be ready to address both. What help would your patient like?
Intervene: Normalize the situation—doubts and concerns about ART are common.
Find time for discussion/information. Address concerns. Simplify the dosage regi-
men, off er a multicompartment medication system. Link the taking of medication
to a regular daily activity. Discuss side-eff ects: what are the risks/benefi ts to
changing dose or ART regimen?
Resource-limited settings
In many resource-limited settings, universal access to ART remains an objective
yet to be achieved. ~50% of those in need of treatment for HIV do not receive
it. Interim prioritization of those with symptomatic HIV or CD4 count <350 cells/
microlitre may be appropriate as these patients are at high risk of mortality and
have most short-term benefi t from ART.
Equality in the treatment of HIV requires:
• Eff ective, acceptable, and reliable methods to reduce HIV transmission, including
treatment as prevention.
• Rapid, accurate, and low-cost diagnosis and monitoring.
• Standardization and simplifi cation of ART regimens.
• Evidence-based ART to prevent the use of sub-standard protocols which compro-
mise treatment and lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains.
• Reduced ART costs and/or eff ective allocation of resources.
An HIV vaccine?
Vaccines are the most eff ective way to prevent infectious disease. They can also
be therapeutic, clearing a virus after infection. HIV vaccines to date have failed to
induce an immune response suffi cient to confer protection. Research is ongoing
into neutralizing HIV antibodies, peptides, genes, viral vectors, physiological ‘boost-
ers’, and mechanisms to counter the mutational evolution of HIV. See www.hvtn.org

Herpes viruses
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) (human herpesvirus 1 and 2)
Includes HSV1 and HSV2. HSV1 infection in ⅔ of world’s population (~3.7 billion <50yrs),
and HSV2 in ~11% (~400 million). Viruses multiply in epithelial cells of mucosal surface
producing vesicles or ulcers. Lifelong latent infection when virus enters sensory neu-
rons at infection site. Can then reactivate, replicate, and infect surrounding tissue.
Disseminated infection if impaired T-cell immunity: pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis.
Presentation: Primary infection: subclinical or sensory nerve (tingling) prodrome,
then vesicles, shallow ulcers. Systemic symptoms possible: fever, malaise, lymphad-
enopathy. Heals 8–12d. Reactivation: usually severe unless immunosuppressed.
Anatomy of infection:
• Herpes labialis: cold sore lesion at lip border, predominantly HSV1.
• Genital herpes: predominantly HSV2 (see p412).
• Gingivostomatitis: fever, sore throat followed by tender oropharyngeal vesicles.
• Keratoconjunctivitis: corneal dendritic ulcers. Avoid steroids. See OHCS p416.
• Herpetic whitlow: painful vesicles on distal phalanx due to inoculation through a
break in the skin.
• Herpes encephalitis: most common treatable viral encephalitis. Transfer of virus
from peripheral site to brain via neuronal transmission. Prodrome: fever, malaise,
headache, nausea. Then encephalopathy: general/focal signs of cerebral dysfunc-
tion including psychiatric symptoms, seizure, focal neurology (temporal involve-
ment in ~60%), memory loss. Predominantly HSV1 in immunocompetent patients.
• Secondary infection: eg HSV infection of eczematous skin—eczema herpeticum.
Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis. Confi rmation required in encephalitis, keratoconjunc-
tivits, or immunosuppression: viral PCR of CSF, swab, or vesicle scraping. Also culture,
immunofl uorescence, serology.
Treatment: Aciclovir: symptoms and viral shedding, will not prevent latent infec-
tion. Give empirical IV aciclovir as soon as HSV encephalitis is suspected, mortality
~70% in untreated disease (see p824).
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) (human herpesvirus 3)
Primary infection transmitted by respiratory droplets. Incubation 14–21d. Invades
respiratory mucosa, replicates in lymph nodes. Disseminates via mononuclear cells
to infect skin epithelial cells. Leads to virus containing vesicles = chicken pox. Virus
then remains dormant in sensory nerve roots. Reactivation is dermatomal = shingles.
Presentation:
• Chicken pox: prodrome 1–2d: fever, malaise,
headache, abdominal pain. Then rash (fi g 9.14):
pruritic, erythematous maculesvesicles, crust
in ~48h. Infectious 1–2d pre-, to 5d post-rash
development (lesions scabbed). Complications
 in immunosuppression: encephalitis (cerebel-
lar ataxia), VZV pneumonia, transverse myelitis,
pericarditis, purpura fulminans/DIC.
• Shingles: painful, hyperaesthetic area, then Fig 9.14 Chicken pox (VZV).

bution. Disseminated infection if immunosup-
pressed. Infectious until scabs appear. Chicken pox risk in non-immune contacts.
Complications: post-herpetic neuralgia, Ramsay Hunt syndrome (p501).
Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis unless immunosuppressed: viral PCR, culture, immuno-
fl uorescence.
Treatment: Oral aciclovir/valaciclovir for uncomplicated chicken pox/shingles in
adults, aim to give within 48h of rash. IV aciclovir if pregnant, immunosuppressed,
severe/disseminated disease (including ocular).
Prevention: Vaccination: not routine in children in UK, given at aged 70 to prevent
shingles reactivation. VZV immunoglobulin if non-immune exposure in immunosup-
pression, pregnancy, neonates.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (human herpesvirus 4)
Virus targets circulating B lymphocytes (lifelong latent infection) and squamous epi-
thelial cells of oropharynx.
Presentation: Usually asymptomatic infection in childhood. Infectious mononucleosis
in ~50% of primary infection in adults: sore throat, fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy
(esp. posterior triangle of neck), palatal petechiae, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaun-
dice. Malaise is prominent. Resolution of symptoms usually within 2 weeks. Chronic
active infection and recurrence are rare. Oncogenicity: see BOX ‘Oncogenic viruses’.
Diagnosis:
• Blood fi lm: lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei) also occur
in other viral infection (CMV, HIV, par vovirus, dengue), toxoplasmosis, typhus, leukae-
mia, lymphoma,drug reactions, lead poisoning.
• Heterophile antibody tests (eg Monospot® , Paul-Bunnell) detect non-EBV heterophile
antibodies which are present in ~85% of infectious mononucleosis sera. False posi-
tive: pregnancy, autoimmune disease, lymphoma/leukaemia.
• Serology: IgM to EBV viral capsid antigen in acute infection. IgG if past infection.
• Reverse transcriptase viral PCR.
Treatment: Supportive. Seek expert help if severe disease/immunosuppression:
observational data on the use of antivirals and steroids.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (human herpesvirus 5)
50–100% of adults are seropositive depending on socioeconomic and sexual risk.
Latent infection: periodic, asymptomatic (but infectious) viral shedding in bodily fl u-
ids including blood transfusion, transplantation (CMV+ve donor to CMVΩve recipient).
Presentation: Asymptomatic in most. Symptoms mimic infectious mononucleosis
(see earlier in topic) or hepatitis. Severe disease in immunosuppressed (post-trans-
plantation, HIV): oesophagitis, gastritis, colitis, retinitis (p438), pneumonitis, hepati-
tis. Infection in pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormality.
Diagnosis: Primary infection in immunocompetent: IgM. Immunosuppressed: quan-
titative nucleic acid amplifi cation testing (QNAT) in blood greater than a defi ned
threshold, or rising titre. Invasive disease: tissue QNAT, histopathology.
Treatment: Given in severe infection/immunosuppression. Ganciclovir, valganci-
clovir (oral bioavailability). Foscarnet and cidofovir: nephrotoxicity limit use. Pre-
emptive treatment in transplant patients based on QNAT results. Risk/benefi t for
antivirals/immunoglobulin in pregnancy remains unclear. Use CMVΩve, irradiated
blood for transfusion if immunosuppressed and at risk: transplant, HIV, leukaemia.
Other herpes viruses
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6): Roseola infantum, febrile illness without rash.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8): Oncogenic (see BOX ‘Oncogenic viruses’), Castleman’s
disease.
Oncogenic viruses
~12% of human cancers are caused by viruses, >80% of these occur in low- and
middle-income countries (table 9.12).
Common traits of oncoviruses:
• Virus is necessary but not suffi cient to cause cancer.
• Cancers appear in context of chronic infection, taking years-decades to appear.
• Immune system has variable role: cancers are associated with both immunosup-
pression and chronic infl ammation.

Immunization
Passive immunity uses pre-formed antibody to protect against infection. It of-
fers immediate but short-lived protection. Natural passive immunity occurs in the
placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus; acquired passive immunity
includes treatment with immunoglobulin eg hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, varicella-
zoster.
Active immunity follows exposure to an antigen, which generates an adaptive im-
mune response. Natural active immunity occurs following infection. Acquired active
immunity is provided by vaccination. Routine vaccinations in the UK are shown in
table 9.13. Additional vaccines are off ered to specifi c vulnerable groups (table 9.14).
Immunosuppression is a contraindication to live vaccines due to the risk of dis-
seminated disease. Includes immunodefi ciency, immunosuppressive treatment, HIV.
Inactivated vaccines can be given but the antibody response may be less: aim to
give >2wks prior to immunosuppressive therapy when possible (or vaccinate whilst
on treatment and considered repeat re-immunization when/if treatment complete).

Fungi
Worldwide  in fungal infection with new pathogenicity, virulence, and new infec-
tive mechanisms. Incidence data limited by failures in recognition and diagnosis.
Divided into superfi cial/cutaneous and systemic/invasive.
Superfi cial/cutaneous mycoses
• Dermatophytosis: Dermatophyte fungi digest keratin. Cause infection of skin and
keratinized structures, eg hair, nails. Presentation: Scale and pruritus. Skin lesion
may be annular with central healing, eg ring worm, tinea corporis. Tinea pedis af-
fects up to 15% of healthy population: skin erosions and blisters in toe web spaces,
dry scale on soles. Fungal nail disease = onychomycosis/tinea unguium: discoloura-
tion, nail thickening. Tinea capitis: scalp scaling, alopecia.
• Superfi cial candidiasis: Usually Candida albicans
(fi g 9.17), a commensal in mouth, vagina, and GI tract.
Risk factors: immunosuppression, antibiotic treat-
ment. Presentation: Oropharyngeal: white patches
on erythematous background (plaque type); sore, in-
fl amed areas (erythematous type). GU: soreness, white
patches/discharge (fi g 9.18). Skin: usually in
folds/in-Fig 9.17 Candida albicans.
terdigital (fi g 9.19). Courtesy of P-Y Guillaume.
• Malassezia: Commensals of greasy skin. Presentation: Pityriasis versicolor: scaly
hypo/hyperpigmented rash with scaling (fi g 9.20). Seborrhoeic dermatitis: scaling
of face, scalp (dandruff ), anterior chest. Malassezia folliculitis: itchy, follicular rash
on back and shoulders ( acne).
Diagnosis: Clinical, microscopy of skin scrapings. Treatment: All superfi cial mycos-
es: topical ‘-azole’ antifungal or terbinafi ne 1–4wk. Also topical nystatin and ampho-
tericin in superfi cial candidiasis. Tinea capitis: griseofulvin, terbinafi ne, itraconazole.
Nail infection requires systemic treatment (terbinafi ne, itraconazole) confi rm diag-
nosis, and caution re side-eff ects including hepatotoxicity.
Systemic/invasive mycoses
• Invasive candidiasis: Typically occurs in immunocompr omised, comorbidity, or
ITU settings. Genetic susceptibility likely contributes. Estimated 250 000/yr with
50 000 deaths. Candidaemia in ~7/1000 ICU patients. Presentation: Risk factors for
invasive fungal disease (see p409), febrile with no microbiological evidence of infec-
tion, new murmur, muscle tenderness, skin nodules. Diagnosis: (Repeated) blood/
tissue culture. PCR. Candida in respiratory secretions alone is insuffi cient. Treat-
ment: Remove all possible catheters. Echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin,
micafungin), fl uconazole, amphotericin (liposomal for renal toxicity). Consider
fl uconazole prophylaxis if risk factors for invasive disease (p403). Consider em-
pirical treatment if persistent fever, unresponsive to other therapy (discuss with
microbiologist, choice depends on local epidemiology, comorbidity).
• Cryptococcus: See HIV p400. Causes meningitis, pneumonia. Presentation: Usu-
ally immunosuppression, eg HIV, sarcoid, Hodgkin’s, haematological malignancy,
post-transplant. History may be long, non-specifi c. Headache, confusion, ataxia,
focal neurological signs, fever, cough, pleuritic pain, SOB. Diagnosis: Indian ink CSF
stain, culture blood/CSF/BAL, antigen testing in blood/CSF. Treatment: Amphotericin
+ fl ucytosine, fl uconazole.
• Histoplasmosis: Worldwide distribution of Histoplasma,  in soil contaminated
with bird/bat faeces. Illness depends on host immunity, estimated ~1%. Presenta-
tion: Flu-like symptoms, fever, malaise, cough, headache, myalgia, pneumonia, lung
nodules/cavitation, pericarditis, mediastinal fi brosis/granuloma ( sarcoid, TB).
Diagnosis: Serology, antigen testing. Treatment: Moderate-severe lung disease or
any CNS involvement: amphotericin, itraconazole.
• Blastomycosis: Blastomyces in decomposing matter, mainly USA/Canada. Pres-
entation: Fever, cough, night sweats, ARDS. risk of extra-pulmonary disease with
immunosuppression: skin, bone, GU, CNS. Diagnosis: Culture, antigen detection
(cross-reacts with histoplasmosis). Treatment: Amphotericin, itraconazole.

1 Any patient with risk factors (see table 9.15).
2 Any systemically unwell patient who fails to respond to antibiotic therapy.
3 Any persistently febrile patient with no microbiological evidence of infection.
Table 9.15 Risk factors associated with invasive fungal infection.
Risk factor Includes
Infection HIV, CMV, TB, colonization/inadequate treatment of superfi cial
fungal disease, broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior fungal infection.
Malignancy Neutropenia, mucositis, haematological malignancy.
Critical illness Mortality prediction score (eg APACHE), prolonged ITU admis-
sion, prolonged ventilation, severe trauma/pancreatitis.
Catheter Central venous catheter, urinary catheter, dialysis access, TPN.
Transplantation Immunosuppressant medication, recent rejection, graft-versus-
host disease.
Genetic Hereditary chronic granulomatous disease, abnormalities in
tumour necrosis factor/interleukins/cytokines.
Surgical Major surgery, GI perforation, anastomotic leak, length of
transplant operation, delayed closure.
Other comorbidity Any disease managed with immunosuppressive therapy, burns.
Data source: Ramana KV et al. Invasive fungal infections. Am J Infectious Diseases and Microbiology
2013, 1(4);64–69.
Investigations:
• Blood culture: three samples, diff erent sites, same sitting, aim total 40–60mL blood.
• Microscopy+immunohistochemistry/fl uorescence depending on site/risk.
• Other: antigen/antibody testing for general (eg mannan, galactomannan) and
specifi c (eg cryptococcal) fungi; fungal metabolites; PCR: for typing/confi rmation.
Seek expert advice on empirical treatment, agent depends on local epidemiology.
Facts of life for ‘budding’ mycologists
To the uninitiated, fungi are like bacteria, but their chitin cell walls and their knack
of mitosis puts them in their own kingdom. They are larger than bacteria (eg 8μm
across), and mostly reproduce by budding of germ tubes (fi g 9.21), not by fi ssion.
Yeasts occur as single cells or as clusters. Hyphae often occur in a mass of cells
(called moulds). A hyphal cell with cross-walls is called a mycelium. Some yeasts
are dimorphic: single cells at 37°C but forming structures called mycelia, contain-
ing fruiting bodies (hyphae), at room temperature.

Healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infection
Healthcare-associated, or nosocomial, infections include diseases which occur:
• As a direct result of treatment or contact in a hospital or healthcare setting.
• As a result of healthcare delivered in the community.
• Outside a healthcare setting but are brought in by patients, staff , or visitors and
transmitted to others.
7–25% of hospital admissions are complicated by a nosocomial infection resulting in
morbidity, mortality, and cost. The causal microbe may be benign in normal circum-
stances, but is able to cause disease when the patient:
1 has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg antibiotic-resistant organisms,
Clostridium diffi cile colitis)
2 is unwell/immunosuppressed (opportunistic infection)
3 has compromised barriers (indwelling catheter/line, ventilation, surgery).
Healthcare-associated infection
Catheter-associated UTI:
A catheter is inserted in ~20% of hospitalized patients. UTI is the most common
infection acquired as a result of healthcare, accounting for 19% of all healthcare-
associated infection. ~50% of UTIS are associated with a urethral catheter. Risk of
infection is related to method of catheter insertion, duration of catheter, quality of
catheter care, and patient susceptibility.
To reduce risk, only catheterize if necessary: Is there obstruction? Do you need
precise urine output monitoring? Remove as soon as possible. See UTI pp296–7.
Infections associated with the use of intravascular access devices:
Includes peripheral, central venous, and arterial catheters: tunnelled and non-
tunnelled. >60% of bloodstream infections are associated with intravascular de-
vices. Risk is higher with central catheters. Infection can result from introduc-
tion of microbes during insertion, access (eg when giving IV antibiotics), or from
microbes elsewhere in the body seeding to the foreign material. Organisms include
Staphylococcus epidermidis (p388), Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin-
resistant forms  MRSA see p388), Candida species (p408), and enterococci (p389).
Ensure that vascular access devices are used only when clinically indicated.
Switch to oral treatment (fl uid, medication, nutrition) as soon as clinically ap-
propriate. Treatment includes removal/exchange of the device whenever possible.
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP):
VAP aff ects up to 20% of patients admitted to intensive care units. Occurs as
the endotracheal tube interferes with protective upper airway refl exes and fa-
cilitates microaspiration. Risks  with non-invasive ventilation. In critical illness,
the oropharynx becomes contaminated with GramΩve bacteria due to antibiotic
exposure, altered host defences, and changes in mucosal adherence. Access to
the airway occurs via folds in the endotracheal cuff and the bacterial biofi lm is
then propelled to the distal airways. Organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(p391), Enterobacteriaceae (p391), and Staphylococcus aureus (p388).
Clinical diagnosis has sensitivity and specifi city. Suspect if new/persistent in-
fi ltrates on CXR plus two or more of: purulent sputum, leucocytosis (>12≈109/L),
leucopenia (<4≈109/L), temperature >38.3°C.
Prevent by reducing colonization (mouthwash, silver-coated endotracheal tubes),
nurse at 45° to  aspiration risk, wean off ventilator as soon as possible..
Surgical site infection:
Aff ects 5% of patients undergoing surgical procedures, contributes to >⅓ of post-
operative deaths. Common organisms include Staphylococcus aureus (p388),
Streptococcus pyogenes (p388), and Enterobacteriaceae when surgery involves
entry to hollow viscera (p391). Prevention methods include hand hygiene, strict
asepsis, MRSA screening and decolonization, hair removal, peri-operative normo-
thermia, minimally disturbed low adherence/transparent dressings.

Clostridium diffi cile
Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus and most common healthcare-associated patho-
gen. Part of colonic fl ora in 2–5% of healthy adults, and 20–40% of hospitalized
adults. Disease occurs when it converts to a vegetative (growth) state with pro-
duction of enterotoxins A and B, causing colitis. Typically happens when inhibition
by competing colonic fl ora is lost due to antibiotic exposure.
Presentation: Watery diarrhoea, mildfulminant colitis (pseudomembranes on
endoscopy=‘pseudomembranous colitis’), ileus, toxic megacolon. Consider in all
diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use, especially if marked neutrophilia.
Diagnosis: Immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (common antigen) de-
tects all strains of C. diffi cile. Detection of toxin (toxin immunoassay, toxin gene
nucleic acid amplifi cation) distinguishes infection from carriage.
Management: SIGHT: Suspect, Isolate within 2h, Gloves and aprons, Hand wash
with soap, Test immediately.
• Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO.
• Severe (WCC >15≈109/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5oC): vancomycin PO
(injection preparation can be given orally and is cheaper than capsules) or fidax-
omicin (cost).
• Non-responders: high-dose vancomycin+IV metronidazole, fidaxomicin, IV immu-
noglubulin (no RCT data).
• Recurrence: (weaning) vancomycin, fi daxomicin, faecal transplantation.
Management of healthcare-associated infection
Identify: Screening (eg hospital admissions for MRSA) allows isolation and decoloni-
zation before harm. Be alert to new infections.
Protect: Isolate multi-antibiotic-resistant microbes (eg MRSA), highly transmissi-
ble infections (eg norovirus), and high-risk groups including reverse barrier nurs-
ing (avoids transmission to, rather than from, patients, eg neutropenia). Patients
with high-risk infections may need negative-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially
infected air leaving the room), or in severe immunosuppression, positive-pressure
rooms (to prevent potentially infected air entering the room). When many patients
have the same nosocomial infection (eg norovirus) they may be barrier nursed to-
gether in dedicated bays.
Treat: Refer to local guidelines, seek expert help. Initial antibiotic choice may diff er
for healthcare-associated infection.
Prevent: Modify risk factors, eg nutrition, post-operative incentive spirometry to
reduce pneumonia risk. Use/convert to narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever pos-
sible. Remove catheters, intravascular access devices, and wean off ventilators as
soon as clinically appropriate. Take measures to  person-to-person transmission:
1 Hand hygiene. Wash hands before and
after each patient contact (fi g 9.22).
Alcohol-based gels are helpful but soap is
needed to kill C. diffi cile spores.
2 Personal attire. In the UK there is a
bare-below-the-elbows policy. Long hair
should be tied back. In areas where infec-
tion risk is particularly high (theatre, ICU),
staff change into scrubs on arrival. Fig 9.22 Areas commonly missed when

Sexually transmitted infection (STI)
STIS6 are common with increasing rates of diagnosis: ~≈2 for Chlamydia trachoma-
tis, N. gonorrhoeae, genital herpes, and syphilis since 2006. Prevalence highest in
young adults (<25yr) and MSM. For HIV see pp398–403. For hepatitis B and C see p278.
Taking a sexual history
• Symptoms: : urethral discharge, dysuria, genital skin problems, testicular pain/
swelling, peri-anal or anal symptoms in MSM. : unusual vaginal discharge, vulval
skin problems, abdominal pain, dyspareunia, unusual vaginal bleeding (post-coital,
intermenstrual, consider referral for urgent colposcopy).
• Exposure: Sexual contacts within last 3 months including sex of partner(s), type
of contact (oral, vaginal, anal), contraceptive method (properly used?), type and
duration of relationship, symptoms in partner(s), risk factors for HIV/hepatitis in
partner(s), whether partner(s) can be contacted. STI history in all. Ask men wheth-
er they have ever had sex with another man.
• Other: Last menstrual period, menstrual pattern, date of last cervical cytology
(smear). Current contraceptive, diffi culties with use/supply. Current/recent anti-
microbial therapy. HPV vaccine history. There may be disclosure of non-consensual
sex, or intimate partner violence. Do not be afraid to ask for help: ‘Everything you
tell me today is confi dential unless you tell me something that worries me about
your safety, at which point I may need to discuss this with another professional
in order to keep you safe.’
Examination
: retract foreskin, inspect urethral meatus for discharge, scrotal contents/tender-
ness/swelling (stand patient up). : vulval examination (lithotomy), speculum of
vagina/cervix, bimanual examination for adnexal tenderness, abdomen/pelvis for
masses. In all: genitoanal area, protoscopy if anal symptoms, inguinal lymph nodes,
oral mucosa if orogenital sex. Use a chaperone and document their name.
Urethritis/vaginal discharge See table 9.16.
Genital warts Caused by human papilloma virus (HPV). See p406.
Genital ulcer(s)
• Genital herpes: HSV. Presentation: fl u-like prodrome, then vesicles/papules around
genitals, anus, throat. These burst, forming painful shallow ulcers. Also urethral
discharge, dysuria, urinary retention, proctitis. Diagnosis: PCR. Treatment: analge-
sia, topical lidocaine. Antivirals within 5d: aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir.
• Syphilis: Treponema pallidum. Presentation:

less ulcer (chancre). Central slough, defi ned rolled edge. Highly infectious.
2 Secondary: dissemination ~4–10wks after chancre. Rash (maculopapular in 50–
75%, on palms/soles in 11–70%), mucous patches, condyloma lata (raised, pale
plaques, often fl exural), fever, headache, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, hepatitis.
3 Tertiary: 20–40yr after infection. Neurosyphilis: aseptic meningitis, focal neu-
rological defi cits, seizures, psychiatric symptoms, Argyll Robertson pupil (p72),
tabes dorsalis (arefl exia, extensor plantar refl ex, dorsal column defi cits, Char-
cot joints). Gummatous syphilis: destructive granulomata in skin, mucus mem-
branes, bones, viscera. Cardiovascular: aortitis, aortic regurgitation/aneurysm.
Diagnosis: PCR. Serology: non-specifi c (RPR, VDRL) sensitive in early infection then de-
cline; specifi c (T. pallidum as antigen, eg TPHA, TPPA) reacts in early infection and per-
sists. Treatment: parenteral benzylpenicillin (eg benzathine penicillin IM), duration
depends on stage. Procaine benzylpenicillin boosted with probenicid in CSF disease.
• Lymphogranuloma venerum: Chlamydia trachomatis. Presentation: mostly MSM
in UK. Painless papule/ulcerlymphadenopathy, fever, arthritis, pneumonitis. Direct
transmission to rectal mucosa causes haemorrhagic proctitis: pain, rectal bleed-
ing/discharge, tenesmus. Diagnosis: PCR. Treatment: doxycycline.

Enteric fever: typhoid and paratyphoid
~20 million cases and 200 000 deaths per year worldwide, ~500/yr in UK mostly im-
ported from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Caused by related, Gram-negative
strains of ‘typhoidal’ Salmonella spp:
• Typhoid (~75–90%): Salmonella typhi.
• Paratyphoid (~10–25%, less severe): Salmonella paratyphi serotype A>B>C.
The bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa. Dissemination occurs without a pri-
mary diarrhoeal response. This distinguishes ‘typhoidal’ from ‘non-typhoidal’ se-
rovars of Salmonella which cause D&V (p428). Transmission is faecal–oral from
contaminated water/food. Incubation 6–30d (most 10–20d). ~10 000 organisms are
required to cause illness. Can be asymptomatic (but shed organism).
Symptoms: Fatigue, headache, anorexia. Marked fever, ‘stepwise’ (rising through
each day with progressive peaks) in <20%. Abdominal pain, relative bradycardia
(Faget’s sign), cough, constipation. Rose spots in ~25% (salmon-coloured, 1–4cm,
blanching, due to bacterial emboli to dermis). Diarrhoea (‘pea-soup’) and hepato-
splenomegaly in 2nd week. Progressive toxicity and complicated disease in up to
10%: intestinal haemorrhage/perforation, myocarditis, hepatitis, pneumonia, DIC,
CNS involvement (delirium, meningism, encephalitis, cerebellar signs, fi ts, coma),
eye complications (corneal ulcer, uveitis, neuritis, thrombosis).
Diagnosis: Isolation of S. typhi from: blood (take multiple cultures of 10–15mL in
fi rst 10d to  sensitivity), bone marrow, intestinal secretions, or stool (sensitivity
after 1st week). Serology has  sensitivity and specifi city, not suffi cient as sole
diagnostic tool (Widal test is Ωve in ~30% of culture-proven cases). LFT. PCR (not
routine).
Treatment: Azithromycin ± IV ceftriaxone. >70% imported from Asia are resistant
to fl uoroquinolones. Fever takes median 5–7d to respond due to intracellular niche
of organism. Antipyretics, fl uid management, nutrition. CNS disease: dexametha-
sone 3mg/kg IV then 1mg/kg/6h for 8 doses (limited data).
Vaccine: Ty21a (oral, live, CI: immunosuppression, pregnancy) or Vi (IM, capsular
vaccine). ~50–80% eff ective for ~3yr. Limited/no protection against paratyphoid.

Malaria: diagnosis
Epidemiology
• 3.2 billion people at risk in 95 countries = half the world’s population (fi g 9.23).
• 214 million/cases per year with 438 000 deaths.
• Sub-Saharan Africa: 88% of malaria cases, 90% of deaths (most age <5yr).
• Most common tropical disease imported into UK, ~2000 cases/yr.
• ~20% fever in travellers from Africa presenting to UK hospitals is due to malaria.
• Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent parasite in Africa and responsible
for most malaria deaths worldwide (=~75% of malaria presenting in UK).
• Plasmodium vivax is the dominant parasite outside of sub-Saharan Africa.
• Preventable and treatable: incidence  by 37% and deaths  by 60% since 2000.
Malaria parasites
Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium. >100 species exist of which 5
cause human disease (see table 9.19). Transmission occurs through the bite of an
infected Anopheles mosquito. Only female mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium as only
females require a blood meal for egg development. Transmission in the absence of
a mosquito is rare: vertical (congenital transfer from mother to child), transfusion,
organ transplantation, needle-sharing.

The life cycle of malaria is de- Plasmodium
pendent on both humans and sporozoites
mosquitoes (fi g 9.27). Sporozo-
ites are transferred to a human
host when an infected mosquito 1st vector Next human

ed, merozoites can be released

releases merozoites which enter
RBCs (‘what a fantastic niche!’). In the RBC, merozoites form larger trophozoites and
erthrocytic schizonts (poor prognostic indicator if seen on blood fi lm). The rupture of
erthrocytic schizonts produces the clinical manifestations of malaria.
Clinical features
Consider in anyone with a fever who has previously visited a malarial area (fi g 9.23),
regardless of prophylaxis.
Presentation: P. falciparum has a minimum incubation of 6 days and most com-
monly occurs within 3 months of return from an endemic area. Take a careful travel
history: country, area of travel, date of return. Do not forget to ask about stopovers.
Symptoms are non-specifi c: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, diarrhoea, cough. Fe-
ver patterns are described but only occur if rupture of infected RBCs is synchronized:
alternate day for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale (‘tertian’); every 3rd day for P.
malariae (‘quartan’). Most patients have no specifi c fever pattern.
Examination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable. If diagnosis is delayed or severe dis-
ease then may present with jaundice, confusion, seizures.
Diagnosis
Immediate blood testing is mandatory in UK:
• Microscopy of thick and thin blood smear. Sensitive and specifi c in experienced
hands.
• Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of parasite antigen. Used for initial screen if
expert microscopy is unavailable, eg out-of-hours. Used in addition to (not instead
of) blood fi lm.
Results should be available within 4h. If malaria is suspected but blood fi lm is nega-
tive: repeat at 12–24h and after further 24h. Malaria is unlikely if three expert serial
blood fi lms are negative.  dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis/encephalitis, HIV,
viral haemorrhagic fever. Care in pregnancy: thick fi lms can be negative despite
parasites in the placenta. Seek expert help.
If P. falciparum (or P. knowlesi) estimated % parasitized red cells should be given:
• >2% =  chance of severe disease (indication for parenteral treatment see pp418–9).
• >10% = severe disease.
Other: FBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), creatinine and urine output (AKI), clotting
(DIC), glucose (hypoglycaemia), ABG/lactate (acidosis), urinalysis (haemoglobinuria).
Malaria is notifi able to public health: www.gov.uk/health-protection-team
Errors to avoid
• Failure to consider diagnosis • Delay in blood fi lm/RDT
• Inadequate travel history • No serial blood fi lm if fi rst test negative
• Belief prophylaxis prevents all malaria • Inadequate treatment (pp418–9)
• Belief presents with a fever pattern • Inappropriate treatment (pp418–9)
• Non-specifi c symptoms not recognized • Failure to anticipate/treat complications.

Malaria: treatment
Falciparum malaria
Risk of deterioration  admit to hospital. Treatment10 depends upon whether the
disease is uncomplicated, or severe. Features of severe disease are:
• Impaired consciousness/seizures (consider LP) • Hb <80g/L
• AKI (oliguria <0.4mL/kg/h, creatinine>265μmol/L) • Spontaneous bleeding/DIC
• Shock (BP <90/60) = ‘Algid malaria’ • Acidosis (pH <7.3)
• Hypoglycaemia (<2.2mmol/L) • Haemoglobinuria
• Pulmonary oedema/ARDS • Parasitaemia >10%.
Remember other poor prognostic indicators: peripheral blood schizonts (see p417),
elevated serum lactate, age.
Uncomplicated falciparum malaria:
Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) achieve rapid clearance of parasites by
combined action at diff erent stages of the parasite cycle (p417):
1 Artemether-lumefantrine:4 tablets at 0, 4, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60h.
1st line in UK (including pregnant >13wks), take with high-fat food to  absorption.
2 Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine: 4 tablets OD for 3d (if weight >60kg).
Take >3h before and after food to prevent excessive peak levels. Possible QTC 
avoid in arrhythmia.
Options if ACT not available:
• Atovaquone-proguanil: 4 tablets OD for 3 days. Parasite clearance ~66% after 3d,
GI side-eff ects in ~25%.
• Oral quinine sulphate 600mg TDS for 5–7d plus doxycycline 200mg OD (or clinda-
mycin 450mg TDS if pregnant) for 7d. Parasite monitoring required. Can cause ‘cin-
chonism’: nausea, deafness, ringing in ears.
Resistance to ACT is emerging in Asia.
Failure rates with antifolate drugs mean Fansidar® is no longer used.
Chloroquine is not used in the treatment of falciparum malaria.
Severe P. falciparum malaria
Give urgent parenteral treatment. Artesunate is treatment of choice.
Meta-analysis shows reduction in mortality of 39% (CI: 25–50%) compared to
quinine, preventing 94 deaths for every 1000 adults treated.11 IV artesunate is
stocked by many infectious disease units in the UK. It can be obtained from
tropical disease centres in London (020 3456 7890) and Liverpool (0151 706 2000).
Artesunate regimen (adult): 2.4mg/kg IV at 0h, 12h, 24h and then daily for up
to 5d. Converted to a full course of ACT (see uncomplicated falciparum earlier in
topic) when able to tolerate oral medication. Side-eff ects: delayed haemolysis
7–21d post-treatment (usually self-limiting)—check Hb 14d post treatment.
If artesunate is not available immediately, treatment should be started with
quinine. It is safe to overlap/combine with artensuate when it is available.
Quinine regimen (adult): Loading dose 20mg/kg over 4h. Then 10mg/kg every
8h for next 48h or until patient can swallow (dose every 12h if patient has renal
failure or hepatic dysfunction or if IV needed >48h). Convert to 600mg PO TDS to
total quinine course 5–7d. Give with 7d oral doxycycline (clarithromycin in children/
pregnant). Side-eff ects: cinchonism (see earlier in topic), hyperinsulinaemia.
Manage in a high dependency setting. Capillary permeability so vulnerable to pul-
monary oedema if over-fi lled. Lactate levels may refl ect intravascular obstruction
rather than circulating hypovolaemia. Monitor: blood glucose every 4h (2h if quinine
infusion), Hb, clotting, electrolytes, creatinine. Daily parasite counts are suffi cient NB:
will fl uctuate with the life cycle of the parasite (see p417) and an increase in fi rst 36h
of treatment may not indicate treatment failure. Given the rapid action of artesu-
nate, exchange transfusion is no longer considered to off er any additional benefi t.
Pregnancy: Little evidence on use/safety of artesunate. On balance of risk (preg-
nancy loss, pulmonary oedema, maternal mortality), artesunate should be given.

Non-falciparum malaria
P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi:
• If mixed infection with falciparum, treat as falciparum.
• If severe/complicated non-falciparum disease, treat as severe falciparum.
• If uncomplicated disease, treat with ACT as uncomplicated falciparum.
Chloroquine can be used for non-falciparum disease. Dosing in adult: 620mg base at
0h, 310mg base at 6–8h, 310mg base on day 2 and 3. But:
• do not use if P. falciparum cannot be excluded
• be aware that ACT may work more quickly on both fever and parasite count
• chloroquine resistance exists in P. vivax (Papua New Guinea, Indonesia).
In addition to other treatment, P. vivax and P. ovale require eradication of liver
hypnozoites with primaquine:
• P. vivax: adult 30mg (0.5mg/kg) daily for 14d.
• P. ovale: adult 15mg (0.25mg/kg) daily for 14d.
Risk of haemolysis with primaquine in G6PD defi ciency so screen prior to use. Seek
expert advice for dosing/monitoring patients with G6PD defi ciency, and in pregnancy.
Malaria prevention
Vector control for all people at risk of malaria. Includes:
• Source reduction by destruction of mosquito breeding sites (ie standing water).
• Long-lasting insecticidal nets. These should be provided free of charge and with
equity of access. Nets last for ~3y, a lifespan of 5y could save ~$3.8bn. Insecticidal
resistance is an increasing concern, should dual agents be used?
• Indoor residual spraying, eff ective for 3–6 months when >80% of houses included.
• Sterile male mosquito release. Estimated to initially require 20 males/human to
be protected  ~64 billion sterile mosquitoes worldwide.
• Genetic modifi cation to develop mosquitoes that are not susceptible to malaria
(and other) parasites. Requires modifi cation that does not  fertility or will not
disperse in vector population. Requires acceptability, infrastructure, and money.
Chemoprophylaxis is the use of antimalarial drugs to prevent clinical disease. In
high-transmission areas it is recommended for pregnant women (given at antena-
tal visits) and infants (given with routine vaccination).
Travellers from the UK to malaria areas should be given:
1 Bite prevention advice: insect repellents with 20–50% DEET (for all >2 months
old including pregnant and breast-feeding). Apply after sunscreen with SPF
>30 as DEET may  sunscreen effi cacy.

Malaria eradication is the permanent reduction of the incidence of malaria
meaning that intervention is no longer required. It is dependent upon the social,
demographic, and economic status of a country, the available healthcare system,
and investment. It requires diagnosis and treatment to achieve parasitologic (as
opposed to clinical) cure in order to eliminate asymptomatic transmission.

Mosquito-borne disease
Mosquito-borne diseases12 are transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with
a virus, bacteria, or parasite. The mosquito acts as the disease vector. Mosquitoes
are arthropods (see table 9.21). Mosquito-borne diseases can therefore also be de-
scribed as vector-borne or arthropod-borne disease. When a virus is transmitted by
an arthropod it is termed an arbovirus (ARthropod-BOrne VIRUS).
Malaria See pp416–9.
Dengue
Most important arbovirus in humans. Dengue viruses (Flaviviruses DENV 1–4) are
transmitted by day-biting Aedes mosquito. 120 countries (fi g 9.28). Symptoms in 100
million/yr. UK: ~500 imported cases/yr.

Presentation: Incubation 3–14d. Fever (up to 40°C), N&V, headache, retro-orbital
pain, myalgia, arthralgia, +ve tourniquet test (infl ate BP cuff to midway between sys-
tolic and diastolic for 5 min≥10 petechiae/inch2). Warning signs/critical phase
may occur 3–7d into illness and needs hospital admission: abdominal pain, persistent
vomiting, fl uid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, haematocrit + plt.
Severe disease: shock (includes postural BP drop >20mmHg), respiratory distress,
severe bleeding, organ involvement (transaminases >1000, GCS, other organ failure).
Diagnosis: PCR for virus/ELISA antigen3 during viraemia (~1st 5d of fever). Serology
(IgM, IgG) after 5d. Also plt, WCC, transaminitis. (: Chikungunya, Zika.) Treatment:
Supportive: prompt but careful fl uid balance due to potential for plasma leak. IV
crystalloid, to maintain eff ective circulation, only in severe disease. 20mL/kg over
15–30min if hypotensive shock. Monitor clinically and via haematocrit. Reduce IV
fl uid as soon as stable. Beware: plasma leak maintains haemocrit unless bleeding.
Consider transfusion if haematocrit without clinical improvement. Avoid NSAIDs.
Chikungunya
Arbovirus (Alphavirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Widespread: Asia, Africa,
Europe, and Americas. Name derives from Kimakonde language meaning ‘to become
contorted’ due to arthralgia. Blood-borne and vertical transmission possible, but
rare. Presentation: Incubation 1–12d. Fever. Polyarthralgia: bilateral, symmetrical,
can be severe, persistent. Headache, myalgia, N&V, maculopapular rash. Diagnosis:3
Viral culture/PCR (~1st 8d), serology. Treatment: Supportive. Analgesia.
Yellow fever
Arbovirus (Flavivirus) spread by Aedes mosquitoes in Africa, South America. Pres-
entation: Incubation ~3–6d. Viraemia ~3d with fever, headache, myalgia, anorexia,
N&V, relative bradycardia (: enteric fever p415). ~15% have remission followed
by severe symptoms ~48h later: epigastric pain, jaundice, AKI, cardiac instability,
bleeding. Mortality 5%-30%. Diagnosis: Clinical and travel history. Virus/PCR in 1st
3d.3 Serology: cross reacts with other fl aviviruses, IgM can persist after vaccination.
Treatment: Supportive. Live vaccine, eff ective for life (certifi cate for 10yr).

in ~80%. Mild illness in ~20%: fever, conjunctivitis, myalgia, rash. Severe acute
illness and Guillian–Barré are rare. Zika and birth defects: Geographical and tem-
poral relationship between infection and microcephaly. Zika detected in amniotic
fl uid is evidence of placental transfer. Specifi c fetal syndrome: microcephaly, in-
tracranial calcifi cation, eye pathology, redundant scalp skin. Small, uncontrolled
studies show fetal abnormalities in up to 30% of pregnant women infected with
Zika.13 Absolute and relative risks unknown (2016). Diagnosis: PCR of viral DNA in
blood/body fl uid. Treatment: Vector control, avoid non-essential travel in preg-
nancy, condoms to prevent sexual transmission. Vaccine trials ongoing (2016).
Lymphatic fi lariasis (elephantiasis)
>40 million aff ected and disfi gured. >1 billion at risk (80% in
sub-Saharan Africa). Filarial parasites (nematodes) trans-
mitted via mosquitoes which bite infected hosts and ingest
microfi laria. These mature in the mosquito with infective
larvae transferring to new hosts during feeding. Adult
worms form nests in lymphatic vessels causing damage and
lymphoedema. Transmission prevented by an annual dose
of two drugs—5.63 billion treatments delivered by WHO since

The global advance of vector-borne disease?
Since 1990, fi ve species of Aedes mosquito have become established in Europe.
The adaptation of mosquitoes to a temperate environment, combined with fu-
ture climate forecasts has led to models14 that predict the UK will be suitable for:
• Plasmodium falciparum transmission by 2030–2080
• Plasmodium vivax transmission by 2030
• Chikungunya transmission in London by 2041
• Dengue transmission after 2100.
Of course, modelling is not simple. Socioeconomic development, urbanization,
land-use change, migration, and globalization all come into play. Surveillance of
mosquitoes at sea-ports, airports, and used-tyre companies remains uninteresting
to date. But consider a time when a visit to South-East England off ers an oppor-
tunity to explore the historical gems of our wonderful capital, and simultaneously
becomes a pertinent question in your diagnostic sieve....

Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis)
Tick-borne multisystem disease caused by the spirochaete Bor-
relia burgdorferi (or related Borrelia spp). ~All cases limited to
northern hemisphere (mainly Europe and US). ~2000–3000 cases/
yr in UK. Risk of infection from tick bite is 3–12% in Europe. Pres-
entation: ≤75% remember the tick bite. Peak infection with
48–72h of attachment. Disease stages:
• Early localized (3–30d after bite): erythema migrans (fi g 9.31),

• Late disseminated (months–yr): acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans = focal infl am-
mation then atrophic skin; Lyme arthritis.
Diagnosis: Clinical: erythema migrans with known exposure or evidence of infection.
Borrelia culture (sensitivity: 40–70% for erythema migrans, <20% for CSF), PCR.4 Two-
tier serology due to false-positive reaction with other spirochaete infection: enzyme
immunoassay/immunofl uorescence + immunoblot. Sensitivity  due to slow serocon-
version: IgM 1–2wks (and may persist), IgG 4–6wks and background positivity 3–15%.
Treatment: Erythema migrans: doxycycline 100mg BD PO for 10–21d (CI <8y, pregnant).
Alternatives: amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, azithromycin. Neuroborreliosis: cef-
triaxone or IV benzylpenicillin or doxycycline for 10–30d. Arthritis/carditis: doxycyline
or amoxicillin or ceftriaxone for 14–30d.15 Prevention: Keep limbs covered; use insect re-
pellent (DEET); inspect skin and remove ticks (use tweezers, hold close to head/mouth).
Rickettsial disease
Rickettsiae are obligate, intracellular coccobacillary forms lying between bacteria
and viruses. Mammals and arthropods are natural hosts. Risk with rural activities
eg camping, hiking, hunting. Divided into:
• Spotted fevers: eg Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Americas); rickettsialpox (
chicken-pox).
• Typhus: scrub typhus in Asia-Pacifi c regions; endemic (fl ea-borne) typhus in tropi-
cal areas; epidemic (louse-borne) typhus in homeless populations, eg refugees.
• Other emerging illnesses: eg ehrlichia, anaplasma.
Presentation: Incubation ~1–2wks. Fever, headache, malaise, rash (maculopapular,
vesicular or petechial), N&V, myalgia. Check for local lymphadenopathy and an eschar
at the site of the bite (scrub typhus). Wide variation in severity depending on aeti-
ology. Fulminant, life-threatening infection possible with Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, louse-borne typhus, scrub typhus. Diagnosis: Clinical: fever + rash + travel to
an endemic area. Serology, culture/PCR of blood/skin biopsy. Treatment: Antibiotics
in severe cases: doxycycline, azithromycin, chloramphenicol.

Zoonoses
Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis)
Gram-positive, aerobic bacillus found in soil worldwide. Humans exposed via infect-
ed livestock or animal products, eg hide, wool, tusks. Infection via inhalation, inges-
tion, contamination of broken skin (includes IV drug use). Bacteria secrete exotoxins:
oedema toxin and lethal toxin. Presentation:
• Cutaneous (~95%): itchy papulevesiclenecrotic eschar. Oedema may be strik-
ing. Regional lymphadenopathy, malaise.
• Inhalation: fever, cough, myalgia, SOB, pleural eff usion (haemorrhagic mediastini-
tis), stridor, death.
• GI (rare): fever, abdominal pain, ascites, mucosal ulcers, GI perforation.
Diagnosis: Vesicular fl uid culture (care, do not disseminate), blood culture, anti-
body ELISA, PCR. (NB: not pneumonic so sputum cultures are Ωve). Treatment: Qui-
nolone/doxycycline. Two agents if systemic disease, eg ciprofl oxacin+clindamycin or
linezolid (then narrow according to sensitivity). Consider anti-anthrax monoclonal
antibody/immunoglobulin as adjunct in inhalational disease.
Bartonella
• B. henselae (cat-scratch disease): from infected cat fl eas. Low-grade fever, re-
gional lymphadenopathy. Encephalitis rare. Skin lesions mimic Kaposi’s sarcoma.
• B. quintana (trench fever): from human body louse. Fever, headache, bone pain.
• B. bacilliformis (bartonellosis): from infected sandfl ies in Andes mountains. Oroya
fever = fever, headache, myalgia, haemolysis. Later nodularvascular skin lesions.
Diagnosis: Clinical, blood culture (fastiduous  needs prolonged culture), serology.
Treatment: Cat-scratch disease often self-limiting. Azithromycin, aminoglycoside.
Brucellosis
Most common zoonosis worldwide: 500 000 cases/yr. Gram Ωve infection of cattle,
swine, goats, sheep, dogs. Human infection via ingestion of infected meat/unpas-
teurized milk/cheese; or through inhalational/mucosal contact with animal body fl u-
ids (eg farmers, slaughterhouse workers, meat packers, hunters). Risk in countries
without animal health programmes. Presentation: Acute (<1 month), sub-acute (1–6
months), or chronic (>6 months). Non-specifi c: fever, anorexia, sweats, weight loss,
malaise ( TB). Localized infection: septic arthritis, spondylitis, meningitis, endo-
carditis, orchitis, abscess. Diagnosis: Culture with prolonged incubation due to slow
doubling time.17 Serology (four assays performed by Public Health England Brucella
Reference Unit 0151 529 4900). Treatment: Doxycycline, rifampicin, aminoglycoside,
ceftriaxone, co-trimoxazole. Needs prolonged course as intracellular with slow dou-
bling time. Relapse usually due to inadequate dose/duration/adherence.
Coxiella burnetii (Q fever)
Q fever is derived from the label ‘query’ fever attributed to an unexplained disease in
Australian abattoir workers. C. burnetii is now recognized as the pathogenic agent.
Sheep, goats, cattle are main sources of infection (also cats, dogs, rabbits, ducks,
ticks). Occurs worldwide. Spores can survive in soil, animal products, and water
for months–yr. Transmitted by contact, inhalation of dust, or consumption of raw
milk products. Presentation: Incubation 3–30d. ~50% asymptomatic. Non-specifi c
symptoms: fever (1–3wks), nausea, fatigue, headache. Pneumonia in 1–2%: typical or
atypical, may have rapid progression. Also splenomegaly, granulomatous hepatitis,
aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, osteomyelitis. Endocarditis is the most common
form of chronic disease. Diagnosis: Coxiella cannot be cultured using routine lab
methods.17 PCR is rapid. Serology can take 2–6wks to become positive and detects
variation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coat. Phase II LPS appears before phase I LPS
 acute infection = IgM/IgG to phase II LPS, chronic infection = IgG to phase I LPS. Se-
rology on paired sera 2–4wks apart provides best diagnostic evidence. Treatment:
Doxycycline. Also rifampicin, chloramphenicol, fl uoroquinolone, macrolide. Hydroxy-
chloroquine alkalinizes the phagosomes in which the bacteria resides and may 

Leptospirosis (Weil’s disease)
Pathogenic leptospire spirochaetes belonging to the subgroup Leptospira interro-
gans. >250 pathogenic serovars. Chronic renal infection of carrier animals: rodent,
cattle, pigs. Spread by water/soil/food contaminated by infected animal urine. Pres-
entation: Incubation ~7d (2–30d). 1st (acute/septicaemic) phase: fever, non-specifi c
fl u-like symptoms. Mild/subclinical in ~90%. Followed by recovery or 2nd (immune/
leptospiruric) phase: conjunctival suff usion, myalgia (CK), jaundice, meningitis, uvei-
tis, AKI, pulmonary haemorrhage, ARDS, myo/pericarditis. (Weil’s disease described in
1886: fever, jaundice splenomegaly, renal failure, CNS symptoms. Term now applied to
all severe disease.) Diagnosis: In UK18 via National Leptospirosis Service (https://www.
gov.uk/guidance/leptospira-reference-unit-services). Culture (blood/CSF) +ve during 1st phase.
Serology. PCR. Treatment: Doxycycline, penicillin. Confl icting evidence of benefi t for
steroids in severe disease.
Yersinia pestis (plague)
Gram Ωve, obligate intracellular pathogen transmitted by small animals and their fl eas
by bite, direct contact, inhalation or ingestion (rare). ~300 cases/yr worldwide. Presen-
tation: Incubation: 3–7d. Flu-like symptoms, then one of three disease forms:
1 Bubonic: most common form. Yersinia pestis enters at bite and travels via lym-
phatics. Infl amed, painful lymph node is termed ’bubo’ and can suppurate.
2 Septic aemic: direct spread without ‘bubo’, or advanced stage after ‘bubo’.
3 Pneumonic: lung disease. Most virulent, least common. Usually from advanced bu-
bonic form but can then transmit via droplets to other humans without fl eas/animals.
Diagnosis: Culture bubo fl uid, blood, sputum. Rapid antigen testing available.
Treatment: Reduces mortality from 60% to <15%: streptomycin, tetracycline.12
Toxoplasmosis
Fig 9.34 Oocysts in cat faeces can
stay in the soil for months, where
rats eat them. The rats get infected,
and, under the direction of Toxoplas-
ma in the amygdala, the rats lose
their fear of cats, and so get eaten in
turn. So the parasite ensure success
by facilitating a jump from interme-
diate to defi nitive host. How does
the parasite overwhelm the innate
fear of cats? By causing a sexual
attraction to normally aversive cat
odour through limbic activity.

Caused by protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. Found worldwide. Life cycle (fi g 9.34).
Infection is lifelong (~⅓ of population). HIV may cause reactivation (p400).
Presentation: Asymptomatic in ~90%. Self-limiting cervical lymphadenopathy, low-
grade fever if normal immune system. Disseminated disease if immunosuppressed:
cerebral abscess, encephalitis, choroidoretinitis, myocarditis, myositis, pneumoni-
tis, hepatitis. Congenital infection: pregnancy loss, neurocognitive defi cit, retinal
damage. Diagnosis: In UK via Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory (0179 228 5058).
Serology: IgG=previous exposure (high avidity IgG suggests infection >3–5 months
ago, used in pregnancy); IgM=acute infection, false +ve or chronic infection with per-
sistent IgM; IgA in cord serum=congenital infection. PCR: blood/CSF/urine/amniotic
fl uid/aqueous/vitreous humour. Treatment: If eye disease, immunosuppressed or
neonate: pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + folinic acid. Corticosteroids for eye infl am-
mation. Spiramycin reduces vertical transmission. Prophylaxis: co-trimoxazole (see
HIV, p400).

Diff erentiating features are given in table 9.23.
Table 9.23 Diff erentiation between VHF

Marburg Incubation typically 5–9d. Clinically identical disease course to Ebola. Ebola/
Marburg suggested by liver tenderness.
Lassa ~80% mild/asymptomatic. Haemorrhage in ~20%. Variable mortality in dif-
ferent epidemics 25–80%. Exudative pharyngitis. Convalescent hearing loss.
Observational data shows response to ribavarin if given in fi rst 6d.
CCHF Tick-borne. Sudden onset prodrome. Haemorrhagic stage common, develops
rapidly, but usually short-lived 2–3d. Ribavarin used in treatment (evidence).
Risk assessment for VHF in UK
Assess for possible transmission and fever.
• Transmission: 1 Travel to endemic area (rural for Lassa fever; caves/primates/ante-
lopes/bats for Ebola/Marburg; tick/animal slaughter for CCHF). 2 Travel to known
outbreak (http://www.promedmail.org). 3 Contact with infected specimen.
• Fever: >37.5°C in the past 24h.
If possible transmission and fever consider ‘high possibility’ (≠high probability), iso-
late, PPE (see BOX ‘Equipment’). Inform local infectious disease team and contact the
Imported Fever Service (0844 778 8990) for VHF investigation. Bruising, bleeding,
and uncontrolled D&V also warrant isolation and discussion if relevant contact history.
Ebola and sacrifi ce
This page is dedicated to Dr Sam Brisbane, director of the emergency depart-
ment in Monrovia, Liberia. Caring, light-hearted, intense, profane. In 2013, he ex-
pressed his greatest worry: an epidemic of VHF. A well-founded fear which would
ultimately prove prophetic, in a hospital with a shortage of personnel, rationing of
gloves, and limited soap. Universal precautions? Unaff ordable, and not even close.
He was also a coff ee farmer. But not for him a deserved retirement to his planta-
tion, surrounded by photographs of 8 children, 6 adopted children, and grand-
children to match. Unprotected, despite a lucky fedora and a gallows sense of
humour, he contracted Ebola in 2014 at the age of 74 whilst manning the front line
of the world’s deadliest VHF epidemic to date. During his illness he told his doctors,
‘When we fi nd ourselves in the middle of the sea and there are rough waves, we
should not give up. We should fi ght on to the end’. A truly sagacious man whose
life and doctoring transcends Western perspectives. We can never replicate your
courage, because we will never know your fear. It is fi ttingly, the stuff of legend.

Gastroenteritis: an overview
Gastroenteritis = diarrhoea (± vomiting) due to enteric infection with viruses, bac-
teria, or parasites.
Diarrhoea can be defi ned as:
• acute diarrhoea: ≥3 episodes partially formed or watery stool/day for <14d
• dysentery: infectious gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhoea
• persistent diarrhoea: acutely starting diarrhoea lasting >14d
• traveller’s diarrhoea: starting during, or shortly after, foreign travel
• food poisoning: disease (infection or toxin) caused by consumption of food/water.
 Food poisoning is notifi able in the UK (www.gov.uk/health-protection-team).
Gastroenteritis can be classifi ed according to infectious aetiology (table 9.24) or
predominant clinical presentation (table 9.25, also see p259).

Traveller’s diarrhoea
Diarrhoea aff ects 20–60% of travellers.20,21 High-risk areas: South Asia, Central and
South America, Africa. Major cause = enterotoxigenic E. coli.
Prevention: Boil water, cook thoroughly, peel fruit and vegetables. Avoid ice, sal-
ads, shellfi sh. Drink with a straw. Hand washing with soap may  risk.
Presentation: Most diarrhoea is during fi rst week of travel. Symptoms are often
unreliable indicators of aetiology but the following may be indicative:
• Enterotoxigenic E. coli: watery diarrhoea preceded by cramps and nausea.
• Giardia lamblia: upper GI symptoms, eg bloating, belching.
• Campylobacter jejuni and Shigella: colitic symptoms, urgency, cramps.
Duration of diarrhoea: most <1wk, 10%>1wk, 5% >2wks, 1%>30d.
Treatment:
• Oral rehydration. Clear fl uid or oral rehydration salts. Home-made oral rehy-
dration recipe: 6 level teaspoons of sugar + half level teaspoon salt in 1L clean,
drinking water.
• Antimotility agents, eg loperamide, bismuth subsalicylates. Avoid if severe pain
or bloody diarrhoea as may indicate invasive colitis.
• Antibiotics: usually not indicated. Considered if rapid cessation of diarrhoea
needed and/or limited access to sanitation/healthcare. Reduce diarrhoea from
~3 to ~1.5 days. Choice depends on allergy, comorbidity, concomitant medica-
tion, and destination of travel: ciprofl oxacin 500mg BD for 3d (care quinolone
resistance, eg SE Asia), rifaximin 200mg TDS for 3d, azithromycin 1g single dose
or 500mg OD for 3d.
Prophylaxis: Not recommended as severe disease and long-term sequelae rare,
risk of C. diffi cile. Consider in immunosuppressed (transplant, HIV, chemotherapy),
GI pathology (IBD, ileostomy, short-bowel), risk with dehydration (sickle cell, CKD).
Care with interactions with usual medications.
• Ciprofl oxacin 500mg OD (80–100% protection).
• Norfl oxacin 400mg OD (75–95% protection).
• Rifaximin 200mg every 12–24h (72–77% protection).
• Bismuth subsalicylate 2 tablets QDS (62–65% protection, 1st line in US).
Persistent diarrhoea: Investigate if >14d or dysentery: FBC, U&E, LFT, infl amma-
tory markers, stool microscopy for ova/cysts/parasites (historically 3 samples but
may not actually improve diagnostic yield, time intensive), molecular testing for
(pre-defi ned) microbes.  of persistent diarrhoea = Giardia (most common diag-
nosis, send PCR), Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella. Post-infectious irritable bowel
syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion (in up to 30%).
Do not forget: malaria, HIV.

Gastroenteritis: specifi c infections
Diarrhoea without blood
Norovirus: Single-stranded RNA virus. Highly infectious. Transmission by contact
with infected people, environment, food (~10%). Most common cause of infectious GI
disease, ~600 000 cases in England/yr. Presentation: 12–48h after exposure, lasting
24–72h: acute-onset vomiting, watery diarrhoea, cramps, nausea. Virus shed in stool
even if asymptomatic. Numerous genotypes and unknown longevity of immunity 
repeat infection occurs. Diagnosis: clinical, stool sample reverse transcriptase PCR.
Treatment: supportive, anti-motility agents, usually self-limiting.
Rotavirus: Double-stranded RNA virus. Wheel-like appearance on EM  ‘rota’. Com-
monest cause of gastroenteritis in children (~50%). Most infected by 5y. Presenta-
tion: incubation ~2d. Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3–8d, fever, abdominal pain.
Diagnosis: clinical, antigen in stool. Treatment: supportive. Routine vaccination in UK
(p407). Virus shed in stool post vaccine  careful hygiene if immunosuppressed and
changing nappies. Live vaccine  delay vaccination if in utero biological agents with
active transfer across placenta (eg infl iximab, adalimumab).
Enterotoxigenic E. coli: Gram Ωve anaerobe. Disease due to heat-stable or heat-
labile toxin which stimulates Na+, Cl- and water effl ux into gut lumen. ~20% of all
infective diarrhoea, ~80% of traveller’s diarrhoea. Presentation: incubation 1–3d.
Watery diarrhoea, cramps. Lasts ~3–4d. Diagnosis: clinical, identifi cation of toxin
from stool culture. Treatment: supportive. See Traveller’s diarrhoea p429.
Clostridium perfringens (type A): Gram +ve, anaerobe. Produces enterotoxin.
Spores survive cooking and germinate during unrefrigerated storage. 2–30 out-
breaks/yr in UK. Presentation: sudden-onset diarrhoea, cramps, usually lasts <24h.
Diagnosis: stool toxin, quantifi cation of faecal bacteria. Treatment: supportive.
-toxin of C. perfringens type C can cause a necrotizing enteritis with fulminant dis-
ease, pain, bloody diarrhoea, septic shock. -toxin is sensitive to trypsin proteolysis
so  risk with trypsin inhibition by sweet potatoes, ascaris infection  occurs in New
Guinea (’pigbel’), central/south America, south-east Asia, China.
Cholera: Vibrio cholerae is a Gram Ωve, aerobic, ‘comma-shaped’ fl agellated motile
vibrati ng/swarming rod. Found in faecally contaminated water. Serovars O1 and O139
cause disease. ~190 000 cases in 2014 (fi g 9.36). Last indigenous case in UK in 1893. Pres-
entation: incubation 2h–5d. ~75% asymptomatic but shed bacteria. Profuse (1L/h)
diarrhoea (‘rice-water’ stool), vomiting, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, circulatory
collapse, death. Diagnosis: Clinical: death due to dehydration from watery diarrhoea
age >5y, or any watery diarrhoea age >5y during known epidemic. Identifi cation of
serovars 01 or 0139 in stool. Rapid dipstick testing available but culture confi rmation
recommended. Treatment: oral rehydration salts (WHO/UNICEF ORS sachet) will
treat12 up to 80%. Needs safe water. Adults may need 1L/hr initially: off er 100mL/5
min. NG if vomiting. IV fl uids if severely dehydrated: Ringer’s lactate or 0.9% saline
plus ORS (beware  K+) up to 200mL/kg in fi rst 24h. Antibiotics in severe dehydration
to  diarrhoea: doxycycline (single dose 300mg) or tetracycline (3d course) guided
by local susceptibility (azithromycin in children/pregnancy). Zinc shortens illness
in child ren (10–20mg/24h). Prevention: cholera loves fi lth: clean water (and clean
politics) abolishes it. Oral cholera vaccines (56–94% effi cacy in adults) dependent on
logistics, cost, production capacity. Antibiotic prophylaxis breeds resistance.

On the mode of communication of cholera
In 1854, at 40 Broad St, London, a child became ill
with diarrhoea, dying on 2 September. Her mother
rinsed her soiled nappies into the house drains
where faulty brickwork allowed mixing with the
water supply of the Broad St pump (fi g 9.37). From
this confl uence sprung the discipline of Public
Health. The ensuing deaths from cholera clustered
around the Broad St pump, as detailed by the lo-
cal doctor, Dr John Snow. He used his now famous
Voronoi diagram showing the deaths within a ‘line
of nearest pump’ to motiva te the parish vestry:
‘In consequence of what I said, the handle of the
pump was removed the following day’, so inaugu-

1 Knowledge of the microscopic cause of disease is not required for public health
measures to succeed (Vibrio cholerae was identifi ed by Robert Kock in 1883).
2 Even the most parochial are capable of life-saving action when assisted by a
doctor in command of the facts.
3 Infl uential friends help. Snow remained largely unknown until the 1930s when
On the Mode of Communication of Cholera was republished by Wade Hampton
Frost, fi rst professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins School.
4 Randomization (Broad St pump versus an alternative water supply) is king.
Diarrhoea with blood (dysentery)
Shigella (sonnei, fl exneri, dysenteriae, boydii): Gram Ωve anaerobe. Presentation:
watery or bloody diarrhoea, pain, tenesmus, fever 1–2d after exposure. Lasts ~5–7d. 
in MSM. Complications: bacteraemia, reactive arthritis (~2% of fl exneri), HUS (Shiga-
toxin-producing dysenteriae, p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immuno-
assay. Treatment: supportive. Nutrition: green bananas (short-chain fatty acids
in colon), zinc if age <6y, vitamin A. Antibiotics if systemically unwell, immunosup-
pressed. Guided by local sensitivities (ciprofl oxacin, azithromycin). Avoid antidiar-
rhoeal agents: risk of toxic dilatation.
Enterohaemorrhagic/Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), eg O157:H7: Gram Ωve
anaerobe. Produces veratoxins which are ‘Shiga-like’ due to similarity with Shigella
dysenteriae. Presentation: incubation 3–8d. Diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis. HUS in
up to 10% (p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay for Shiga-toxin.
Treatment: Supportive. Do not give antibiotics:  risk of HUS.
Campylobacter: Gram Ωve, spiral-shaped rod. Presentation: incubation 1–10d (usu-
ally 2–5d). Bloody diarrhoea, pain, fever, headache. Complications: bacteraemia,
hepatitis, pancreatitis, miscarriage, reactive arthritis, Guillain–Barré. Diagnosis:
stool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay. Treatment: supportive. Antibiotics only in
invasive cases, refer to local sensitivities (macrolide, doxycycline, quinolone).
Salmonella enterocolitis (non-typhoidal): Gram Ωve, anaerobic, motile bacilli. Pres-
entation: diarrhoea, cramps, fever, usually within 12–36h of exposure. Invasive infec-
tion (<10%) can cause bacteraemia/sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis.
Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR. Treatment: supportive. Meta-analysis shows no evi-
dence of benefi t for antibiotics in healthy people. Consider in severe/extra-intestinal
disease according to local sensitivities (quinolone, macrolide).
Yersinia enterocolitica: Gram Ωve rod. Presentation: incubation 4–7d. Diarrhoea,
fever, pain (may mimic appendicitis), vomiting. May last 1–3wk. Also erythema
nodosum, reactive arthritis (~1 month after diarrhoea). Diagnosis: stool culture,
agglutination titres. Treatment: antibiotics in severe disease depending on local sen-
sitivities (aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, quinolone).

Gastrointestinal parasites
Giardiasis
Giardia lamblia (fi g 9.38) is a fl agellate protozoan. Faecal–oral
spread from infected drinking water/food/fomites. Presentation:
Asymptomatic in the majority. Incubation 1–3wks. Diarrhoea,
fl atulence, bloating, pain, malabsorption. Duration of symptoms
typically ~2–6wks. Most common diagnosis if persistent travel-
ler’s diarrhoea (p429). Diagnosis: Stool microscopy for cysts and
troph ozoites. Intermittent shedding so multiple samples (3) may

Amoebiasis
© Prof. S Upton; Kansas Univ.
Protozoan Entamoeba histolytica (fi g 9.40) ~10% world’s
population, mortality ~100 000/yr. Faecal–oral spread. B.oil water to destroy cysts.
Presentation:
• Asymptomatic passage of cysts in ~90% (‘luminal amoebiasis’).
• Intestinal amoebiasis: dysentery (often insidious onset/relapsing), pain, colitis, ap-
pendicitis, toxic megacolon. Amoeboma = infl ammatory abdominal mass, usually
caecal/RIF ± obstruction.
• Extra-intestinal (invasive) disease. Amoebic liver abscess in ~1%. Single mass con-
taining ‘anchovy-sauce’ pus. High swinging fever, RUQ pain/tenderness. LFT normal
or  (cholestatic). 50% have no history of amoebic dysentery. Also peritonitis (rup-
ture of colonic abscess), pleuropulmonary abscess, cutaneous/genital lesions.
Fig 9.40 The lifecycle of Entamoeba histolytica is in two stages: cysts and trophozoites. Cysts
(10–15μm across) typically contain four nuclei (upper right image). During excystation in the
gut lumen, nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division, giving rise to eight trophozoites.
Tropho zoites (10–50μm across) contain one nucleus with a central karyosome (lower right image).
Trophozoites inhabit the caecum and colon. Re-encystation of the trophozoites occurs in the colon,
and excretion of cysts in faeces perpetuates the lifecycle.

sample. Enzyme immunoassay: antigen detection as adjunct to microscopy, antibody
detection in extra-intestinal disease. PCR can distinguish E. histolytica from morpho-
logically identical but non-invasive E. dispar. Treatment: Metronidazole/tinidazole
for amoebic dysentery and invasive disease. Diloxanide furoate: luminal agent, 10d

Caused by blood-fl ukes (trematode worms) of the genus Schistosoma (table 9.27).
258 million people in 78 countries required treatment in 2014. The life cycle is shown
in fi g 9.44. Disease develops after contact with contaminated freshwater (swim-
ming, washing). Symptoms are due to an immune complex response to the migrating
parasite (Katayama syndrome), or deposition of parasite eggs in body tissues.
Presentation: ~50% asymptomatic or non-specifi c symptoms. Clinical syndromes:
• Larval penetration: pruritic papular rash (‘swimmer’s itch’).
• Migration of schistosomules: Katayama syndrome 2–8wks after exposure: fever,
urticaria, diarrhoea,cough,wheeze, hepatos plenomegaly, eosinophilia.
• Host response to egg deposition:
• Intestinal disease: pain, diarrhoea, blood in stool, (granulomatous) hepatomeg-
aly, splenomegaly. Heavy chronic infection can cause bowel perforation, hyper-
plasia, polyposis, liver fi brosis, portal hypertensionvarices.
• Urogenital disease: haematuria, dysuria, ureteric fi brosishydronephrosis, CKD,
bladder fi brosis/cancer, genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, vulval
nodules, haemospermia, prostatitis.
• Lung disease: pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale.
• CNS disease: rare, acute lower limb paraplegia, transverse (‘traveller’s’) myelitis.
Diagnosis: Ova in urine (S. haematobium) or faeces (all other species) is specifi c,
but sensitivity <50% if light infection. Serology for egg antigen becomes +ve once
mature fl ukes lay eggs  will be Ωve in Katayama fever. Bowel/bladder histology.
Chronic S. haematobium: bladder calcifi cation on AXR, renal obstruction, hydrone-
phrosis ± thick bladder wall on USS. Treatment: two doses of praziquantel 20mg/
kg PO separated by 4h. Steroids for Katayama fever. If eosinophils >3months after

Echinococcosis (hydatid disease)
Zoonotic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Clinically impor-
tant disease forms in humans are:
• Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease, hydatosis): E. granulosus. Found world-
wide. Usual host is dog. Also goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels, yaks.
• Alveolar echinococcosis: E. multilocularis. Found in northern hemisphere. Usual
hosts are foxes and rodents.
Human ingest parasite eggs via food/water contaminated by animal faeces, or by
handing animals which are infected with the tapeworm. Disease is due to the devel-
opment of cyst-like larvae in viscera, usually liver/lungs. Presentation: Slow grow-
ing cysts may be asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms and signs depends on
location:
• Liver: abdominal pain, nausea, hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, PUO.
• Lung:: dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis.
• CNS: space-occupying signs.
• Bone: an interesting osteolytic cause of knee pain, cord compression.
• Silent disease in breast, kidney, adrenals, bladder, heart, psoas.
Diagnosis: USS/CT/MRI: avascular fl uid-fi lled cysts ± calcifi cation ( benign cyst, TB,
mycoses, abscess, neoplasm). Serology. Positive echinococcal antigen. Treatment:
Get help (including surgical). Depends on cyst type, location, size, and complications.
Prolonged treatment (months/years) with albendazole. PAIR: Puncture, Aspirate,
Inject (hypertonic saline/chemicals), Reaspirate. Beware spillage of cyst contents:
praziquantel can be given peri-operatively.
Fasciola hepatica (common liver fl uke)
Parasitic infection. ~2 million infected worldwide. Highest rates of infection in Bolivia
and Peru. Infective larvae develop in aquatic snail hosts. Humans infected via con-
taminated water, waterplants eg watercress, or by eating the undercooked liver of
another host animal eg sheep, goat. Disease caused by migration of parasite to bile
ducts. Presentation: Acute phase with migration from intestine through liver (2–4
months): abdominal pain, nausea, fever, urticarial rash, eosinophilia. Chronic phase
with egg production in the bile ducts: cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, cirrho-
sis. Diagnosis: Serology in acute and chronic phase. Ova in stool/bile aspirate only
in chronic phase. Treatment: Triclabendazole as a single dose. Treat all suspected
cases in endemic areas.
Other liver fl ukes: opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis
Opisthorchis and clonorchis are liver fl ukes acquired by eating contaminated fi sh,
mainly in south-east Asia. Adult worms lodge in the small bile ducts and gallbladder.
Presentation: Abdominal pain, GI disturbance, cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholangio-
carcinoma. Diagnosis: Ova in stool. Treatment: Praziquantel.

Neurological disease
Botulism
Neuroparalytic infection caused by neurotoxin from anaerobic, spore-forming
Clostridium botulinum (rarely C. butyricum, C. barattii). Food-borne due to toxin
production in food (botulus is Latin for sausage), or wound botulism due to spore
germination in wound (includes IV drug use). Toxin blocks release of acetylc holine
at neuromuscular junction causing fl accid paralysis. Presentation: Incubation up
to 8d (usually 12–36h). Afebrile, descending, fl accid paralysis: diplopia,ptosis,dysar-
thria, dysphagia, progressive paralysis of limbs, respiratory failure. Autonomic signs:

swab) for later confi rmation by culture/PCR. In UK contact GI Bacteria Reference Unit
(020 8327 7887). Treatment: Get help. Admit to ITU. Botulinum antitoxin (from Public
Health England, Colindale 020 8200 4400), benzylpenicillin, metronidazole.
Tetanus
Caused by anaerobic Clostridium
tetani spores universally present in
soil. Enters body via a breach in skin.
Produces a neurotoxin (tetanospas-
min) which disseminates via blood/
lymphatics and interferes with neu-
rotransmitter release causing unop-
posed muscle contraction and spasm
(tetanus = ‘to stretch’). ~6 cases/yr Fig 9.45 Spasm causing opisthotonus (arching of

of spasm: diazepam/lorazepam/midazolam (may need high doses IV), IV magnesium
sulphate, baclofen (intra-thecal administration needed for penetration of blood–
brain barrier  only with ICU ventilatory support), dantrolene, botulinum toxin-A.23
Vaccination: Routine in UK (p407). Prophylaxis following injury: TIG if heavy contami-
nation. If vaccination history unknown/incomplete: TIG plus dose of vaccine in a dif-
ferent site. Precautionary travel booster if >10y since last dose.
Poliomyelitis
A highly infectious picornavirus, transmitted via faeco–oral route or contaminated
food/water. Replicates in intestine. Invades nervous system with destruction of an-
terior horn cells/brain stemirreversible paralysis. Incidence by 99% since forma-
tion of Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. 74 cases in 2015. Remains endemic
in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2016).12 Presentation: Incubation 7–10d. Flu-like pro-
drome in ~25%. Pre-paralytic stage: fever, HR, headache, vomiting, neck stiff ness,
tremor, limb pain. ~1 in 200 progress to paralytic stage: LMN/bulbar signs ± respira-
tory failure. No sensory signs. Post-polio syndrome in ~40% of survivors (up to 40y
later): new progressive muscle weakness, myalgia, fatigue.
Diagnosis: Viral culture of stool (most sensitive, 2 samples >24h apart), pharyn-
geal swabs, blood, CSF. PCR can diff erentiate wild-type from vaccine. Paired serol-
ogy. Treatment: None. Vaccination: Salk (inactivated, IM) or Sabin (live, oral). In
previously endemic areas 200 million volunteers have vaccinated 3 billion children,
preventing 1.5 million deaths in the last 20y.

Rabies
Rhabdovirus transmitted through saliva or CNS tissue, usually from the bite of an
infected mammal, eg bat (in UK), dog (95% of transmissions to humans), cat, fox.
Disease is fatal once symptoms appear. Worldwide distribution. ~50 000 deaths/yr,
most in Africa/Asia. Presentation: Incubation ~9–90d. Prodrome: headache, ma-
laise, odd behaviour, agitation, fever, paraesthesia at bite/wound site. Progresses
to one of two disease forms:
• ‘Furious rabies’: hyperactivity and terror (hydrophobia, aerophobia)
• ‘Paralytic rabies’: fl accid paralysis in the bitten limbcomadeath.
Diagnosis: Clinical: potential exposure + signs of myelitis/encephalitis (non-pro-
gressive disease and disease >3wk are negative indicators). Viral PCR (saliva, brain,
nerve tissue) or CSF antibodies may off er later (post-mortem) confi rmation. Treat-
ment: If bitten, or lick to broken skin, wash (>15min) with soap and seek urgent
help. Post-exposure prophylaxis: vaccination ± rabies immunoglobulin. Experimental
treatments: ribavirin, interferon alfa, ketamine. Preventable and elimination feasible
with pre-exposure vaccination of all at risk. Vaccination of dogs can  human cases.
Japanese encephalitis virus
Flavivirus spread by mosquitoes. Endemic transmission (~3 billion at risk) and com-
mon cause of viral encephalitis in Asia and west Pacifi c. Severe disease is rare (1 in
250) but leads to neurological or psychiatric sequelae in up to 50%, mortality up to
30%. Presentation: Incubation 5–15d. Most asymptomatic, or mild fever and head-
ache only. Severe disease: high fever, headache, meningism, altered mental status,
coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, death. Diagnosis: Clinical in endemic area. Serum/
CSF serology, PCR.7 Treatment: Supportive. Vaccination.
West Nile virus
Mosquito-borne fl avivirus with transmission in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and Americas. Presentation: Incubation 2–14d. Asymptomatic in ~80%.
West Nile fever in ~20%: fever, headache, N&V, lymphadenopathy. Neuroinvasive in
~1%: encephalitis, meningitis, fl accid paralysis, mortality ~10%. Diagnosis: Serum/
CSF IgM, viral PCR. Treatment: Supportive. Vaccine awaited (2016).
Neurocysticercosis
Most common helminthic disease of the CNS and most frequent cause of preventable
epilepsy (~50% of epilepsy in endemic areas, fi g 9.46). Caused by pork tapeworm
Taenia solium. Consumption of infected pork leads to intestinal infection (taeniasis)
and the shedding of T. solium eggs in stool. Invasive disease occurs when the shed
eggs are ingested via faeco–oral transmission. Neurocysticercosis is due to larval
cysts infecting the CNS. Presentation: Determined by site and number of lesions
(cysticerci) within the brain/spinal cord. Epilepsy in 70%. Focal neurology in ~20%:
motor/sensory loss, lan-
guage disturbance, invol-
untary movements. Also
headache, visual loss,
meningitis, hydrocepha-
lus, cognitive impairment.
Diagnosis: CT/MRI imaging
plus serology. Treatment:
Seizure control (evidence
on drug choice, length of
treatment or prophylaxis).

Filarial infection
Onchocerciasis (‘river blindness’)
Caused by fi larial worm, Onchocerca volvulus. Transmitted by the bite of infected
black fl ies which breed in fast-fl owing rivers and streams. Second most com-
mon infectious cause of blindness worldwide: predominantly sub-Saharan Africa,
Brazil, Venezuela, Yemen. Presentation: A nodule forms at the site of the bite
where larvae mature to adult worms. The female adult can release up to 1000
microfi lariae/day causing:
• skin disease: altered pigmenta tion, lichenifi cation, loss of elasticity, poor healing
• eye disease: keratitis, uveitis, cataract, fi xed pupil, fundal degeneration, optic
neuritis/atrophy, visual impairment/loss (fi g 9.51)
• impaired lymphatic function: lymphadenopathy, elephantiasis.
Diagnosis: Visualization of microfi laria in eye or on skin snip biopsy: a fi ne shav-
ing of clean skin is incubated in 0.9% saline to allow microfi lariae to emerge for
microscopic identifi cation. Serology. Treatment: Ivermectin 150mcg/kg, one dose
every 3–12 months (depending on likely re-exposure). CI if coexisting Loa-Loa due
to risk of fatal encephalitic reaction. Or 6wk doxycycline. No vaccine available.

Loiasis (African eye-worm)
Caused by parasitic worm Loa loa. Transmitted via bite of deerfl ies (=mangrove/
mango fl ies) which breed in rainforests of west and central Africa. Presenta-
tion: Recurrent pruritic lesions due to angioedema (‘Calabar swellings’), myalgia,
arthralgia. The adult worm can migrate through subcutaneous (fi g 9.52) and sub-
conjunctival (fi g 9.53) tissue: ‘Something’s wiggling in my eye, doctor’. This eerie
eye trip causes intense conjunctivitis, which heals if left alone. (Don’t treat until
transmigration in the eye is over: on detecting your therapy the worm tends to
panic.) Also causes glomerulonephritis, and encephalitis. Diagnosis : Microfi lar-
iae on blood smear, serology, PCR. Eosinophilia. Treatment: Diethylcarbamazine
(DEC) kills both microfi lariae and adult worms. Risk of encephalopathy is related
to microfi larial load: albendazole can be used to  microfi larial load prior to DEC
(response may be slow).

Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO)
This chapter gives guidance on hundreds of pyrexia-causing infections; but what
should you do if your patient has a fever that you cannot explain? Pyrexia of un-
known origin (PUO)24 has a diff erential of >200 diseases. 15–30% of these patients will
eventually be given an infective diagnosis (depending on your corner of the globe).
~20% will remain undiagnosed, but in most of these the fever will resolve within 4wks.
Diagnostic criteria
Pyrexia >3wks with no identifi ed cause after evaluation in hospital for 3d or ≥3
out-patient visits.
Fever may also be undiagnosed in specifi c subgroups despite appropriate evaluation
for 3d, including negative cultures at ≥ 2 days:
• Nosocomial PUO: Patient hospitalized for >48h with no infection at admission.
• Immunodefi cient PUO: Pyrexia in patient with <500 neutrophils/microlitre.
• HIV PUO: Pyrexia in HIV infection lasting 3d as an in-patient or >4wks as an outpatient.
History
Most PUO are due to common diseases with atypical presentation. Consider all de-
tails as potentially relevant. Include: travel (p414), diet, animal contact, changes in
medication, recreational drug use, obstetric/sexual history, family history (table 9.30).
Examination
Confi rm fever. Pattern of fever is rarely helpful (contrary to the textbooks, most ma-
laria has no specifi c pattern). Do not forget: mouth, genitals, skin, thyroid, lymphatic
system, eyes including retina, temporal arteries (table 9.30).
Investigation
Extent of investigation depends on immune status and how well the patient is.
• Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP, ESR, electrophoresis, LDH, CK, ANA, ANCA, rheumatoid fac-
tor, HIV test, malaria smear, interferon-gamma release assay for TB (p394).
• Microscopy and culture: Blood ≈3, urine, sputum (including AFB), stool, CSF.
• Imaging: CXR, abdominal/pelvic USS, venous Doppler. Consider: CT(PA), MRI, echo (TOE).
Fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) highlights areas of glucose uptake including tu-
mour and infl ammation. It may aid/direct diagnosis in up to 50% of PUO.
• Other: Hepatitis serology, CMV, EBV, autoimmune screen, cryoglobulins, toxoplasmo-
sis, brucellosis, Coxiella, lymph node biopsy, endoscopy, temporal artery biopsy.

Eliciting the weird and the wonderful
Listen to your patient You have two cultures to master: the host and the patho-
gen. Prolonged immersion in both may be needed.
Ask Do not expect to fi nd apposite questions such as these in any other textbook:
1 ‘Have you delivered any septic babies in the last year?’ Impress and cure
your obstetrician friends who tell you that ‘I’m so depressed about not being
able to shake off this fl u’, and who have forgotten about transfer of brucellosis
from baby to obstetrician.
2 ‘Are your carp well at present?’ Mycobacte rium marinum skin infection.
3 ‘Could that be a Hyalomma tick bite from when you rode your ostrich in
last week’s race?’ Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.
4 ‘Who has been licking your face recently?’ Pasteurella multocida.
5 ‘Has your dog been on holiday this year?’ Monkeypox from prairie dogs.
6 ‘Has your pet hedgehog lost weight?’ Salmonella.
7 ‘Did you develop your headache after you adopted your pet magpie?’ Zo-
onotic transmission of Cryptococcus neoformans causing meningitis.
8 ‘Did you have a stray pig living under your house when the monsoon
started?’ Pigs + standing water + mosquitoes = Japanese encephalitis.
9 ‘Did you sample the local frog paella?’ Angiostrongyliasis causing eosino-
philic meningitis.
10 ‘Did your goat miscarry last year?’ Coxiella burnetii.
11 ‘Did your depressed pig develop a purple snout?’ Erysipelothrix rhusi-
opathiae endocarditis via swine erysipelas.
12 ‘Can I see your pet lobster: he may be the cause of your bad hand?’ Lob-
sterman’s hand, an erysipeloid infection from Erysipelothrix. Pet lobsters have
a grand pedigree. Gérard de Nerval used to take his
pet lobster for walks, on a blue silk lead, beside the
Seine (fi g 9.60). A lobster, he said, is, ‘serious-minded
and quiet, doesn’t scratch or bark like a dog, and
knows all of the secrets of the deep’. His lobster’s
mission was to combat the Philistinism chaining us
all to mediocrity.
Ask also, ‘Where have you been?’ Though you will not be

well?’ (Gérard de Nerval).
end’. It may be a question of amnesic stopovers. Or
perhaps your patient is an airport baggage-handler, bitten by a hitch-hiking mos-
quito. And even when there has been no travel to the tropics, global warming is
ensuring that the tropics are travelling to us. To the fi rst writers of medical books,
Paradise was just beyond the Far East, and the world was a disc surrounded by
oceans of blue water. But the world moves on, tarnished, tawdry, and trashed; and
Paradise appears to be evolving with ever more serpents in the garden, beguiling
us with ambiguous answers to our great questions.
Don’t give up If the culture is negative, tests may need repeating. Perhaps the
organism is ‘fastidious’ in its nutritional requirement or requires a longer incuba-
tion? Even if culture is achieved, it may be that the organism grown is fl ora not
pathogen. If culture fails, look for antibodies or antigen. PCR is increasingly used

tricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then
with artifi cial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for
mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, -
or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.’

I think, therefore I am
It is the brain, more than any other organ, that marks Homo sapiens apart from
other animals. Our ability to be self-aware, to think, and to reason has formed
the basis of scientifi c inquiry and philosophical speculation for millennia, as we
attempt to rationalize and defi ne this cognitive capability. What is the mind?
Less tangible than other aspects of our being, throughout time humans have
looked to explanations from philosophy, folklore, religion, and now science. The
concept of the sense of self and being that defi nes us a¬¬—whether it be called
the ego, nous, or the soul—remains intriguing yet elusive to explain. Aristotle
held that the psyche (Greek: ψυχή=soul) was not separate to its housing body,
as one could not exist without the other. This view was directly contradicted by
the 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes. He proposed the theory of
‘mind–body dualism’ in which the mind, located in the pineal gland, is an entirely
separate entity to the material being, and controls the avatar of the physical
body like a puppeteer.
These confl icting viewpoints well illustrate the spectrum of neurological disease
and its blurred boundaries with psychiatry and psychology. Jean Martin Charcot
(1825–1893), often credited as the father of neurology, appeared to be more inter-
ested in this crossover than neuronal dysfunction: he spent two decades of his
career studying hysteria in Paris, initially attributing symptoms of crying, fainting,
and temporary blindness to an organic, inherited cause, before revising his view
in later life to conclude that this was a psychological disease. His controversial
work in this fi eld inspired his student Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytical theories,
and illustrated the very real power of the conscious, or sub-conscious, to produce
physical symptoms, a phenomenon familiar to all physicians. Perhaps refl ecting
our frustration with this challenging area as much as his limited success, we re-
member Charcot for his more tangible outputs, for example, in giving the inau-
gural description of, among other things, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, and of course
his eponymous misshapen joint resulting from proprioceptive loss.
However, both Aristotle and Charcot would have surely agreed with Descartes’
proposition of ‘cogito ergo sum’: I think, therefore I am. Whether mind and brain
are dual or one, they are inextricably linked and the very nature of awareness
proves its existence.

Where is the lesion?
This is an important fi rst question to ask and depends on recognizing characteristic
patterns of cognitive, cranial nerve, motor, and sensory defi cits. Locating a focal le-
sion can be aided by features such as asymmetry (eg one pupil dilated, one upgoing
plantar response) or a spinal level (eff ects may be symmetrical below the lesion).
Note that sometimes there is no single lesion, rather, a general insult causing a
falsely localizing sign, eg abducens nerve palsy in ICP. Other generalized causes of
specifi c local eff ects are: trauma,encephalitis, anoxia,poisoning,or post-ictal states.
Patterns of loss Are crucial in locating the lesion (see BOX ‘From fi ndings to neu-
roanatomy’):
Upper motor neuron (UMN): Patterns of weakness are caused by damage anywhere
along the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tracts: pathways that carry motor information
from the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex up to the synapse with anterior horn
cells in the spinal cord (via the internal capsule, brainstem, and cord).1 •UMN weakness
aff ects groups rather than individual muscles, typically in a ‘pyramidal’ pattern: in
the arm, extensors are predominantly aff ected; in the leg the opposite is true and
the fl exors are the weaker muscle group. •Spasticity develops in the stronger muscle
groups (arm fl exors and leg extensors). It manifests as tone that is velocity-de-
pendent, ie the faster you move the patient’s muscle, the greater the resistance, until
it fi nally gives way (like a ‘clasp-knife’).2 •Muscle wasting is less prominent. • There is
hyperrefl exia: refl exes are brisk. • Plantars are upgoing (+ve Babinski sign) ± clonus
(elicited by rapidly dorsi fl exing the foot; ≤3 rhythmic, downward beats of the foot are
normal). •Loss of skilled fi ne fi nger move ments may be greater than expected from
the overall grade of weakness (see BOX ‘Muscle weakness grading’). UMN lesions can
mimic LMN lesions in the fi rst few hours before spasticity and hyperrefl exia develop.
Lower motor neuron (LMN): Lesions are caused by damage anywhere from the ante-
rior horn cells distally, including the nerve roots, plexuses, and peripheral nerves. The
pattern of weakness corresponds to the muscles supplied by the involved neurons.
•Aff ected muscles show wasting ± fasciculation (spontaneous involuntary twitching).
•There is hypotonia/fl accidity: the limb feels soft and fl oppy, providing little resistance
to passive stretch. •Refl exes are reduced or absent; the plantars r emain fl exor. The
chief diff erential for LMN weakness is a primary muscle disease (p510)—but here there
is symmetrical loss, refl exes are normal or lost late, and there is no sensory component.
Mixed LMN and UMN signs: Can occur, eg in MND, B12, taboparesis (see p466).
Sensory defi cits: It is important to test individual modalities and remember the
quirks of our normal wiring: correctly interpreted, the distribution of sensory loss
and the modality involved (pain, T°, touch, vibration, joint-position sense) will help
refi ne and increase your confi dence in localizing the lesion (see BOX ‘From fi ndings
to neuroanatomy’). Pain and T° sensations travel along small fi bres in peripheral
nerves and the anterolateral (spinothalamic) tracts in the cord and brainstem
(p516), whereas joint-position and vibration sense travel in large fi bres in peripheral
nerves and the large dorsal columns of the cord.
Muscle weakness grading (MRC classifi cation)
• Grade 0 No muscle contraction • Grade 3 Active movement against gravity
• Grade 1 Flicker of contraction • Grade 4 Active movement against resistance
• Grade 2 Some active movement • Grade 5 Normal power (allowing for age)
Grade 4 covers a big range: 4Ω, 4, and 4+ denote movement against slight, moder-
ate, and stronger resistance; avoid fudging descriptions—‘streng th 4/5 through-
out’ suggests a mild quadriparesis or myopathy. It is better to document ‘poor
eff ort’ and the maximum grade for each muscle tested. Distribution of weakness
tells us more than grade of weakness (grade does help document improvement).
1 Most of the fi bres of the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tract decussate at the medullary pyramids, hence the
name and the contralateral nature of symptoms. Extrapyramidal denotes damage to the basal ganglia and
presents as parkinsonism (see p468, 494).
2 Whereas with rigidity,  tone is not velocity-dependent but constant throughout passive movement.

From fi ndings to neuroanatomy: localizing the lesions
Cortical lesions may cause a particularly localized problem with hand or foot
movements, with normal or even tone—but refl exes more proximally in the arm
or leg will point to this being an UMN rather than LMN lesion. Sensory loss may be
confi ned to discriminative functions, eg stereognosis and two-point discrimina-
tion (p499). Internal capsule (p470) and corticospinal tract lesions cause con-
tralateral hemiparesis (UMN signs). There is generalized contralateral sensory loss.
A cranial nerve palsy (III–XII) contralateral to a hemiple gia implicates the brain-
stem on the side of the cranial nerve palsy. Lateral brainstem lesions show both
dissociated and crossed sensory loss with pain and T° loss on the side of the face
ipsilateral to the lesion, and contralateral arm and leg sensory loss. Cord lesions
causing paraparesis (both legs) or quadriparesis/tetra plegia (all limbs) are sug-
gested by fi nding a motor and refl ex level (power is unaff ected above the lesion,
with LMN signs at the level of the lesion, and UMN signs below the lesion). A sensory
level is the hallmark (albeit a rather unreliable one)—ie decreased sensation below
the level of the lesion with normal sensation above. Hemi- cord lesions cause a
Brown-Séquard picture (p696): dorsal column loss on the side of the lesion and
contralateral spinothalamic loss. Dissociated sensory loss may occur, eg in cervi-
cal cord lesions—loss of fi ne touch and proprioception without loss of pain and
temperature (or vice versa, eg syringomyelia, p516; or cord tumours). Peripheral
neuropathies: (p502.) Most cause distal weakness, eg foot-drop; weak hand (note:
although Guillain–Barré syndrome typically presents as distal weakness that as-
cends over time, some atypical forms of Guillain–Barré syndrome may present
with proximal weakness due to nerve root involvement). Sensory loss is typically
worse distally (may involve all sensory modalities or be selective, depending on
nerve fi bre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs
with trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p503); invol vement of several nerves
(mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg in DM or vasculitis. Sensory loss from indi-
vidual nerve lesions will follow anatomical territories (dermatomes, p454), which
are usually more sharply defi ned than those of root lesions.
Also ask
What is the lesion? Are the cells diseased, dysfunctional, disconnected (after a
stroke), or under- or overexcited (migraine; epilepsy)? Is there loss of a specifi c type
of nerve cell, as in MND or subacute com bined degeneration of the cord (B12, p334).
Arteriopaths get strokes, tropical travellers get wormy lesions.
Why? Is there a systemic disease causing the neurology? Eg atrial fi brillation
allowing an embolus to form, which then lodges in the patient’s dominant hemi-
sphere, causing an infarct that presents with dysphasia. Do a full systems ex-
amination and always beware the irregularly irregular pulse.

Drugs and the nervous system
The brain is a gland that secretes both thoughts and molecules: both products are
modulated by neurotransmitter systems. Some target sites for drugs:
1 Precursor of the transmitter (eg levodopa).
2 Interference with the storage of transmitter in vesicles within the pre-synaptic
neuron (eg tetrabenazine).
3 Binding to the post-synaptic receptor site (eg bromocriptine).
4 Binding to the receptor-modulating site (eg benzodiazepines).
5 Interference with the breakdown of neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft
(eg acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; monoamine oxidase inhibitors—MAOIS).
6 Reduce reuptake of transmitter from synaptic cleft into pre-synaptic cell (eg
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors—SSRIS, eg fl uoxetine; or serotonin and
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors—SNRIS, eg mirtazapine).
7 Binding to pre-synaptic autoreceptors (eg pindolol, a -blocker with partial 5HT au-
toreceptor antagonist eff ects, can be used to augment antidepr essant therapy).
Important neurotransmitters (and some associated drugs) are listed in table 10.1.
Storms on the sea of neurotransmission
The complex and subtle mixture of chemicals that bathes our hundreds of trillions
of synapses has been likened to a ‘sea’ of neurotransmitters. If so, it is surely a
seascape of exquisite beauty, no matter how disturbed cognition may become by
the storms that whip the waves on the surface. A well-chosen prescription may
off er a lifeboat from such storms, but before prescribing any drug that modu-
lates neurotransmission, consider that you are about to release a blunt and poorly
understood force into a delicate environment. • The drug (or a metabolite) must
be able to pass through the blood–brain barrier to have an eff ect. •The conse-
quences of any sedative eff ects may be severe. • There will be short- and long-
term SEs (eg tardive dyskinesia with neuroleptic drugs). • Most drugs aff ect many
neuro transmitters, increasing therapeutic scope (and uncertainty) eg risperidone
(blocks D2, 5HT2, 1 and 2 receptors). • Metabolites of drugs may have equal or more
important pharmacological eff ects resulting in clinically important interactions
with drugs aff ecting eg hepatic metabolism. • One neurotrans mitter may have
many eff ects, eg dopaminergic neurons go awry in Parkinson’s disease, schizo-
phrenia, and addiction to drugs and gambling, by aff ecting motor control, motiva-
tion, eff ort, reward, analgesia, stress, learning, attention, and cognition.

Cerebral blood supply
Knowledge of the anatomy of the blood supply of the brain helps diagnosis and
management of cerebrovascular disease (pp470–8). Always try to identify the area
of brain that correlates with a patient’s symptoms and identify the aff ected artery.
Internal carotid arteries Supply the majority of blood to the anterior two-thirds of
the cerebral hemispheres and the basal ganglia (via the lenticulos triate arteries). At
worst, internal carotid artery occlusion causes fatal total i nfarction of these areas.
More often, the picture is like middle cerebral artery occlusion (see later in topic).
The circle of Willis (fi g 10.2) An anastomotic ring at the base of the brain fed by the
three arteries that supply the brain with blood: the internal carotids (anteriorly) and
the basilar artery (posteriorly, formed by the joining of the vertebral arteries, which
supply the brainstem). This arrangement may compensate for the eff ects of occlusion
of a feeder vessel by allowing supply from unaff ected vessels; however, the anatomy of
the circle of Willis is variable and in many people it does not provide much protection.
Cerebral arteries Three pairs of arteries leave the circle of Willis to supply the
cerebral hemispheres: the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (fi gs 10.2,
10.3). The anterior and middle cerebrals are branches of the internal carotid arteries;
in 80%, the basilar artery divides into the two posterior cerebral arteries. Ischaemia
from occlusion of any one of them may be lessened by retrograde supply from lep-
tomeningeal vessels.
Anterior cerebral artery: (fi g 10.2) Supplies the frontal and medial part of the
cerebrum. Occlusion may cause a weak, numb contralateral leg ± similar, if milder,
arm symptoms. The face is spared. Bilateral infarction is a rare cause of paraplegia
and an even rarer cause of akinetic mutism.
Middle cerebral artery: (fi g 10.2) Supplies the lateral part of each hemisphere. Oc-
clusion may cause contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss (esp. face and arm),
contralateral homonymous hemianopia due to involvement of the optic radiation,
cognitive change including dysphasia with dominant hemisphere lesions, and visuo-
spatial disturbance (eg cannot dress; gets lost) with non-dominant lesions.
Posterior cerebral artery: (fi gs 10.2, 10.4) Supplies the occipital lobe. Occlusion
gives contralateral homon ymous hemianopia (often with macula sparing).
Vertebrobasilar circulation Supplies the cerebellum, brainstem, occipital lobes;
occlusion causes signs relating to any or all three: hemianopia; cortical blindness;
diplopia; vertigo; nystagmus; ataxia; dysarthria; dysphasia; hemi- or quadriplegia;
unilat eral or bilateral sensory symptoms; hiccups; coma. Infarctions of the brain stem
can produce various syndromes, eg lateral medullary syndrome, in which occlusion
of one vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebe llar artery causes infarction of
the lateral medulla and the inferior cerebellar surface ( vertigo, vomiting, dysphagia,
nystagmus, ipsilateral ataxia, soft palate paralysis, ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome, and
a crossed pattern sensory loss—analgesia to pin-prick on ipsilateral face and contra-
lateral trunk and limbs). Locked-in syndrome is caused by damage to the ventral pons
due to pontine artery occlusion. Patients are unable to move, but retain full cognition
and awareness, communicating by blinking, electronic boards, or special computers.
Right-to-die legislation may be invoked...as one suff erer blinked: ‘My life is dull, miser-
able, demeaning, undignifi ed, and intolerable.’ Locked-in syndrome is diff erent from
other right-to-die conditions because patients need someone to do the act for them.
Subclavian steal syndrome: Subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the origin of
the vertebral artery may cause blood to be stolen by retrograde fl ow down this
vertebral artery down into the arm, causing brainstem ischaemia typically after use
of the arm. Suspect if the BP in each arm diff ers by >20mmHg.

Thomas Willis
Thomas Willis (1621–1675) is one of those happy Oxford heroes who hold a bogus
DM degree, awarded in 1646 for his Royalist sympathies while at Christ Church,
the most loyally royal college in the University. He had a busy life inventing
terms such as ‘neurology’ and ‘refl ex’. Not only has his name been given to his
famous circle, but he was the fi rst to describe myasthenia gravis, whooping
cough, and the sweet taste of diabetic urine. He was the fi rst person (few have
followed him) to know the course of the spinal accessory nerve. He is unusual
among Oxford neurologists in that he developed the practice of giving his lunch
away to the poor. He also espoused iatrochemistry: a theory of medicine ac-
cording to which all morbid conditions of the body can be explained by distur-
bances in the fermentations and eff ervescences of its humours.

Testing peripheral nerves
While there is some anatomical variation between individuals in ascribing particular
nerve roots to muscles, tables 10.2–10.4 represent a reasonable compromise. Der-
matomes and sensory nerve roots are shown in fi gs 10.5-10.9, pp454-5.
Remember to test proximal muscle power: ask the patient to sit from lying, to pull
you towards him/herself, and to rise from squatting (if reasonably fi t).
Observe walking—easy to forget, even if the complaint is of diffi culty walking!
Don’t be caught out by weakness secondary to musculoskeletal pathology—the
traditional neurological examination relies on the musculoskeletal system being
intact. Ruptured tendons and fractures may mimic focal neurological lesions (espe-
cially in patients who can’t give a clear history).

Headache
Every day, thousands of people visit the doctor complaining of headache. Tension
headaches are the most common, but beware the disabling and treatable (migraine,
cluster headache), and the sinister (space-occupying lesions, meningitis, subarach-
noid haemorrhage). A good history is the key. Ask about:
Onset Rapid onset headaches are concerning; the key diagnosis to rule out here
is •subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH, p478), sudden-onset, ‘worst ever’ headache,
often occipital, stiff neck, focal signs, consciousness. Other diff erentials include:
•Meningitis (p822): fever, photophobia, stiff neck, purpuric rash, coma. May be
associated with neck stiff ness (≈ meningeal irritation). Do an LP, start antibiotics.
•Encephalitis (p824): fever, odd behaviour, fi ts, or reduced consciousness. Do an
urgent CT head and LP to look for signs of infection. •Post-coital headache.
Subacute/gradual onset headaches: •Venous sinus thrombosis (p480): subacute
headache, papilloedema. •Sinusitis: dull, constant ache over frontal or maxillary si-
nuses, with tenderness ± postnasal drip. Pain is worse on bending over. Ethmoid or
sphenoid sinus pain is felt deep in the midline at the root of the nose. Common with
coryza (p406). The pain lasts ~1–2 wks. CT can confi rm diagnosis but is rarely needed.
•Tropical illness: eg malaria: travel history, fl u-like illness (p416); typhus (p415). •In-
tracranial hypotension: CSF leakage, eg iatrogenic after LP or epidural anaesthesia.
Suspect if headaches worse on standing;. treat with epidural blood patch over leak,
if conservative management with IV fl uids and caff eine fails.
Character Tight band? Think tension headache (the usual cause of bilateral, non-
pulsatile headache ± scalp muscle tenderness). Throbbing/pulsatile/lateralizing?
Think migraine (p458).
Frequency Headaches that recur tend to be benign: • Migraine: p458. • Cluster
headache: (see BOX ‘Cluster headache’) • Trigeminal neuralgia: (see BOX ‘Trigemi-
nal neuralgia’) • Recurrent (Moll aret’s) meningitis: suspect if fever/meningism
with each headache. Send CSF for herpes simplex PCR (HSV2). Is there access to
subarachnoid spaces via a skull fracture, or a recurring cause of aseptic meningitis
(SLE, eg abducens nerve palsy, Behçet’s, sarcoid)?
Duration Chronic, progressive headaches can indicate  ICP. Typically worse on
waking, lying, bending forward, or coughing. Also: vomiting, papilloedema, sei-
zures, false localizing signs, or odd behaviour. Do imaging to exclude a space-
occupying lesion, and consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. LP is
contraindicated until after imaging.
Associated features Eye pain ± reduced vision: Think acute glaucoma. Typically
elderly, long-sighted people. Constant pain develops rapidly around one eye, radiat-
ing to the forehead with markedly reduced vision, visual haloes, and a red, congested
eye (p561). Seek expert help at once. If delay in treatment of >1h is likely, give eye
drops (eg 0.5% timolol maleate ± 2% pilocarpine) and acetazolamide 500mg PO. Jaw
claudication tender with thickened, pulseless temporal arteries: Giant cell arteritis:
(p556) Subacute-onset headache with ESR >40mm/h. Exclude in all >50yrs old with a
headache that has lasted a few weeks: prompt diagnosis and steroids avoid blindness.
Precipitating causes Head trauma: Commonly causes localized pain but can be
more generalized. It lasts ~2wks; often resistant to analgesia. Do CT to exclude
subdural or extradural haemorrhage if drowsiness ± lucid interval, or focal signs
(p482). Also ask about: Analgesia, sex, food (eg chocolate, cheese, coff ee).
Red fl ags See p780.
Drug history Exclude medication overuse (analgesic rebound) headache: Culprits
are mixed analgesics (paracetamol + codeine/opiates), ergotamine, and triptans. This
is a common reason for episodic headache becoming chronic daily headache. Anal-
gesia must be withdrawn—aspirin or naproxen may mollify the rebound headache.
A preventive may help once off other drugs (eg tricyclics, valproate, g abapentin;
p504). Limit use of over-the-counter analgesia (no more than 6d per month).
Social history Ask about stress or recent life events; may not explain the pathol-
ogy, but will help you appreciate the context in which symptoms are experienced.

Cluster headache
Cluster headache may be the most disabling of the primary headache disorders.
The cause (unknown : ≥5:1; onset at any age; comm oner in smokers).
Symptoms Rapid-onset of excruciating pain around one eye that may become
watery and bloodshot with lid swelling, lacrimation, facial fl ushing, rhinorrhoea,
miosis ± ptosis (20% of attacks). Pain is strictly unilateral and almost always af-
fects the same side. It lasts 15–180min, occurs once or twice a day, and is often
nocturnal. Clusters last 4–12wks and are followed by pain-free periods of months
or even 1–2yrs before the next cluster. Sometimes it is chronic, not episodic.
Treatment Acute attack: ‘Keep calm ... carry oxygen’: give 100% O2 for ~15min via
non-rebreathable mask (not if COPD); sumatriptan SC 6mg at onset (or zolmitriptan
nasal spray 5mg).
Preventives Avoid triggers: Eg alcohol. Medication: Consider: corticosteroids
(short term only; many SE); verapamil 360mg, lithium 900mg (monitor carefully).
Trigeminal neuralgia
Symptoms: Paroxysms of intense, stabbing pain, lasting seconds, in the trigemi-
nal nerve distribution. It is unilateral, typically aff ecting mandibular or maxillary
div isions. The face screws up with pain (hence tic douloureux). Triggers: Wash-
ing aff ect ed area, shaving, eating, talking, dental prostheses. Typical patient: 
>50yrs old; in Asians : ≈ 2:1. Secondary causes: Compress ion of the trigemi-
nal root by anomalous or aneurysmal intracranial vessels or a tumour, chronic
meningeal infl am mation, MS, zoster, skull base malformation (eg Chiari). MRI: Is
necessary to exclude secondary causes (~14% of cases). : Carba mazepine (start
at 100mg/12h PO; max 400mg/6h; lamotrigine; phenytoin 200–400mg/24h PO; or
gabapentin (p504). If drugs fail, surgery may be necessary. This may be directed
at the peripheral nerve, the trigeminal ganglion, or the nerve root. Microvascular
decompression: Anomalous vessels are separated from the trigem inal root. Ste-
reotactic gamma knife surgery can work, but length of pain relief and the time to
treatment response are limiting factors. Facial pain : p65.

Migraine
15% of us suff er from migraines, (:  3:1); the economic costs extend to £billions/yr.
Symptoms Classically: •Visual or other aura (see below) lasting 15–30min followed
within 1h by unilateral, throbbing headache. Or: •Isolated aura with no headache;
•Epi sodic severe headaches without aura, often premenstrual, usually unilateral, with
nausea, vomiting ± photophobia/phono phobia (‘common migraine’). There may be
allodynia—all stimuli produce pain: ‘I can’t brush my hair, wear earrings or glasses,
or shave, it’s so painf ul.’ Prodrome: Precedes headache by hours/days: yawning, crav-
ings, mood/sleep change. Aura: • Visual: chaotic distorting, ‘melting’ and jumbling of
lines, dots, or zigzags, scotomata or hemianopia; • Somatosensory: paraesthesiae
spreading from fi ngers to face; • Motor: dysarthria and ataxia (basilar migraine),
ophthalmoplegia, or hemiparesis; • Speech: (8% of auras) dysphasia or paraphasia.
Partial triggers Seen in 50%: CHOCOLATE or: chocolate, hangovers, orgasms,
cheese/caff eine, oral contraceptives, lie-ins, alcohol, travel, or exercise.
Associations Obesity, family history.
Diagnosis Clinical, based on the history. Diagnostic criteria if no aura: ≥5 head-
aches lasting 4–72h + nausea/vomiting (or photo/phonophobia) + any 2 of: • Unilateral
• Pulsating • Impairs (or worsened by) routine activity.
Diff erentials Cluster or tension headache, cervical spondylosis, BP, intracranial pa-
thology, sinusitis/otitis media, dental caries. TIAS may mimic migraine aura.
Management Avoid identifi ed triggers and ensure analgesic rebound headache
is not complicating matters (p456). Prophylactic treatment: Can achieve ~50%
in attack frequency in most patients; consider after risks and benefi ts discussion.
1st line: Propranolol 40–120mg/12h or topiramate 25–50mg/12h (teratogenic, can in-
terfere with Pill effi cacy). Amitriptyline 10–75mg nocte can be used, though this is
off -licence. Patients may be on previously-recommended prophylactic agents (eg
valproate, pizotifen, pregabalin or ACE-i): if achieving good control then continue
as required. 12-weekly botulinum toxin type A injections are a last resort in chronic
migraine . Treatment during an attack: NICE recommends an oral triptan (or nasal
in 12–17y) combined with either an NSAID or paracetamol.1 Monotherapy with any of
the above (or aspirin 900mg) can also be considered. Anti-emetics may help even in
the abscence of nausea and vomiting. Triptans are CI if IHD, coronary spasm, uncon-
trolled  BP, recent lithium, SSRIS, or ergot use. Rare SE: arrhythmias or angina ± MI,
even if no pre-existing risk. Non-pharmacological therapies: Warm or cold packs to
the head, or rebreathing into paper bag (PaCO2) may help abort attacks. Butterbur
extracts or ribofl avin supplementation may have a role. NICE recommend 10 sessions
of acupuncture over 5–8 weeks if both topiramate and propranolol are unsuitable or
ineff ective. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation may help.
Considerations in females Incidence of migraine (especially with aura) + ischae-
mic stroke is increased by use of a combined OCP. Use progesterone-only or non-
hormonal contraception in migraine + aura, though a low dose combined OCP can
be used in those without aura. Further risk: • Smoking • Age >35yrs • BP • Obesity
(body mass index >30) • Diabetes mellitus • Hyperlipidaemia • Family history of arte-
riopathy <45yrs. Warn patients to stop OCP at once if they develop aura or worsen-
ing migraine; see OHCS p301. Perimenstrual migraine: If uncontrolled with standard
treatment and the onset of headache is predictable then consider frovatriptan
2.5mg BD or zolmitriptan 2.5mg BD/TDS on the days migraine is expected. Pregnancy:
Migraine often improves; if not, get help—worsening headaches in pregnancy are
associated with a greater risk of pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular complications.
Off er paracetamol 1st line. Triptans and NSAIDs can be used but discuss risks and
benefi ts with patients fi rst. Don’t use aspirin if breastfeeding. Anti-emetic: cyclizine
or promethazine. Prophylaxis: seek specialist advice.

What is going on in migraine?
Despite the high prevalence of migraines, the underlying pathophysiology is
poorly understood. The previously favoured theory of dilatation of cerebral and
meningeal arteries has been largely disproven, so what is the cause? • MRI dur-
ing attacks shows episodic cerebral oedema, dilatation of intrac erebral vessels,
and  water diff usion not respecting vascular territories, so the primary event
may be neurological. • PET suggests migraine is a subcortical disorder aff ecting
the modulation of sensory processing • Magneto-encephalographic (MEG) stud-
ies have shown resting (interictal) hyperexcitability at least in the visual cortex,
suggesting a failure of inhibitory circuits. • Hormones play a role: the incidence of
migraine in both pre-pubertal and post-menopausal women is equal to men, yet
increases to 3:1 during reproductive years, with 50% of females reporting syn-
chrony of migraines with the menstrual cycle. • Elevated levels of 5-HT metabo-
lites in the urine of patients during migraine attacks was fi rst reported in 1972,
and while its exact signifi cance is controversial, the effi cacy of triptans (5HT1B/1D
agonists) support its role in migraine. • Triptans also inhibit release of substance P
and pro-infl ammatory neuropeptides, blocking transmission from the trigeminal
nerve and implicating trigeminal nerve dysfunction.
The bigger picture
Vincent Van Gogh suf-
fered from ‘sick headaches’,
widely believed to have been
migraines. Could his swirl-
ing, cascading starry night
(fi g 10.10) be a visual aura?
Just as with the fragile
mental health of Van Gogh,
migraine often co-exists
with other chronic condi-
tions—and the combined
negative impact on physi-
cal and mental health is
immense. Don’t treat each
disease in isolation. Rather, Fig 10.10 ‘The Starry Night’ Vincent Van Gogh 1889
attempt to restore a good World History Archive/Ann Ronan Collection / Age
relationship with the self— Fotostock
and the recovery of the pur-
pose of life through dialogue. This is the hardest but the most rewarding task,
and may save some ears.

Blackouts
Causes of collapse ± loss of consciousness (LOC) are many; take a careful history (BOX).
Vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope Occurs due to refl ex bradycardia ± pe-
ripheral vasodilation provoked by emotion, pain, or standing too long (it cannot
occur when lying down). Onset is over seconds (not instantaneous), and is often pre-
ceded by pre-syncopal symptoms, eg nausea, pallor, sweating, and narrowing of vis-
ual fi elds. Brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion,
but there is no tonic/clonic sequence. Urinary incontinence is uncommon, and there
is no tongue-biting. Unconsciousness usually lasts for ~2min and recovery is rapid.
Situation syncope Symptoms as for vasovagal syncope but with a clear precipi-
tant: cough syncope occurs after a paroxysm of coughing; effort syncope is brought
on by exercise; there is usually a cardiac cause, eg aortic stenosis, HCM; micturition
syncope happens during or after urination: mostly men, at night.
Carotid sinus syncope Hypersensitive baroreceptors cause excessive refl ex brady-
cardia ± vasodilation on minimal stimulation (eg head-turning, shaving).
Epilepsy (p490) Features suggestive of this diagnosis include: attacks when asleep
or lying down; aura; identifi able triggers (eg TV); altered breathing; cyanosis; typical
tonic–clonic movements; incontinence of urine; tongue-biting; prolonged post-ictal
drowsiness, confusion, amnesia, and transient focal paralysis (Todd’s palsy).
Stokes–Adams attacks Transient arrhythmias (eg bradycardia due to complete
heart block) cause cardiac output and LOC. The patient falls to the ground (often
with no warning except palpitations; injuries are common), and is pale, with a slow
or absent pulse. Recovery is in seconds: the patient fl ushes, the pulse speeds up, and
consciousness is regained. As with vasovagal syncope, anoxic clonic jerks may occur
in prolonged LOC. Attacks may happen several times a day and in any posture.
Other causes Hypoglycaemia: (p214) Tremor, hunger, and perspiration herald light-
headedness or LOC; rare in non-diabetics. Orthostatic hypotension: Unsteadiness or
LOC on standing from lying in those with inadequate vasomotor refl exes: the elderly;
autonomic neuropathy (p505); antihypertensive medication; overdiuresis; multisys-
tem atrophy (MSA; p494). Anxiety: Hyperventilation, tremor, sweating, tachycardia,
paraesthesiae, light-headedness, and no LOC suggest a panic attack. Drop attacks:
Sudden fall to the ground without LOC. Mostly benign and due to leg weakness but
may also be caused by hydrocephalus, cataplexy, or narcolepsy. Factitious black-
outs: Pseudoseizures, Münchausen’s (p706).
Examination Cardiovascular, neurological. Measure BP lying and standing.
Investigation All with recurrent syncope (or falls) need cardiac assessment—ur-
gently if associated with palpitations, arrhythmias, 3rd-degree AV block, or pro-
longed QT interval (p711). ECG ± 24h ECG (arrhythmia, long QT, eg Romano–Ward, p96);
U&E, FBC, Mg2+, Ca2+, glucose; tilt-table test;3 EEG, sleep EEG; echocardiogram; CT/MRI
brain; ABG if practical (PaCO2 in attacks suggests hyperventilation as the cause).
While the cause is being elucidated, advise against driving (see p158).
3 Patient is subject to continuous ECG and BP monitoring while strapped to a table and moved rapidly from
resting horizontal position to vertical. Induction of symptoms with inappropriate BP drop >30mmHg or
bradycardia suggests neurally mediated syncope. Consider pacing.

Blackout history
It is vital to establish exactly what patients mean by ‘blackout’: loss of
consciousness?—a fall to the ground without loss of consciousness?—vertigo or
visual disturbance? Talk to the patient and witnesses and let them tell you as
much as possible without prompting or leading. Ask:
• Does the patient lose awareness?
• Does the patient injure themselves?
• Does the patient move? Are they stiff or fl oppy? (A tonic phase preceding clonic
jerking points towards epilepsy.)
• Is there incontinence? (More common in epilepsy, but can occur with syncope.)
• Does their complexion change? (Pale/cyanosis suggests epilepsy; very pale/
white suggests syncope or arrhythmia.)
• Does the patient bite the side of their tongue? (Suggests epilepsy.)
• Are there associated symptoms eg palpitations, sweats, pallor, chest pain, dysp-
noea (see fi g 10.11)?
• How long does the attack last?
Before the attack:
• Is there any warning?—Eg typical epileptic aura or cardiac pre-syncope.
• In what circumstances do attacks occur? (If watching TV, consider epilepsy).
• Can the patient prevent attacks?
After the attack:
• How much does the patient remember about the attack?
• Is there muscle ache? (Suggests a tonic–clonic seizure.)
• Is the patient confused or sleepy? (Suggests epilepsy.)
Background to attacks:
• When did they start?
• Are they getting more frequent?
• Is anyone else in the family getting them? Sudden arrhythmic death may leave
no evidence at postmortem, or there may be hereditary cardiomyopathy (refer
those with a relative who has had a sudden unexplained death <40yrs old).

with an implantable defi brillator (see p132).

Vertigo and dizziness
Is this vertigo? Complaints of ‘dizzy spells’ are very common and are used by
patients to describe many diff erent sensations. True vertigo is a hallucination of
movement, often rotatory, of the patient or their surroundings. In practice, simple
‘spinning’ is rare—the fl oor may tilt, sink, or rise. The key to diagnosis is to fi nd out ex-
actly what the patient means by ‘dizzy:’ if this is not vertigo or if atypical symptoms
are present consider other causes, eg if there is loss of awareness, think of epilepsy
or syncope; if there is faintness, lightheadedness, or palpitations, think of anaemia,
dysrhythmia, anxiety, or hypotension.
Associated symptoms: Diffi culty walking or standing (may fall suddenly to the
ground), relief on lying or sitting still (vertigo is almost always worsened by move-
ment); nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating. Associated hearing loss or tinnitus implies
labyrinth or VIIIth nerve involvement.
Causes
Benign positional vertigo: Occurs on head movement due to disruption of debris in the
semicircular canal of the ears (canalolithiasis). Fatiguable nystagmus on performing
the Hallpike manoeuvre is diagnostic; Epley manoeuvres clear the debris (OHCS p555).
Acute labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis): Abrupt onset of severe vertigo, nausea,
vomiting ± prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe
vertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3–4wks. : reassure. Sedate.
Ménière’s disease: Increased pressure in the endolymphatic system of the inner ear
causes recurrent attacks of vertigo lasting >20min, fl uctuating (or permanent) sen-
sorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (with a sense of aural fullness ± falling to one
side). : bed rest and reassurance in acute attacks. An antihistamine (eg cinnarizine)
is useful if prolonged, or buccal prochlorperazine if severe, for up to 7d.
Ototoxicity: Amino glycosides, loop diuretics, or cisplatin can cause deafness ± vertigo.
Acoustic neuroma: (fi gs 10.12, 10.13) Doubly misnamed: it is a Schwannoma (not
neuroma) arising from the vestibular (not auditory) nerve. They account for 80%
of cerebellopontine angle tumours and often present with unilateral hearing loss,
with vertigo occurring later. Growth rate is slow (usually 1–2 mm/year) and can be
predicted by serial MRIs. With progression, ipsilateral Vth , VIth , IXth , and Xth nerves
may be aff ected (also ipsilateral cerebellar signs). Signs of  ICP occur late, indicating
a large tumour. Commoner in  and neurofi bromatosis (esp. NF2, p514).
Traumatic damage: If trauma aff ects the petrous temporal bone or the cerebello-
pontine angle then the auditory nerve may be damaged, causing vertigo, deafness,
and/or tinnitus.
Herpes zoster: Herpetic eruption of the external auditory meatus; facial palsy ± deaf-
ness, tinnitus, and vertigo (Ramsay Hunt syndrome, see p501).
Others: Vertiginous epilepsy; MS; stroke/TIA; migraine; motion sickness; alcohol in-
toxication.

Hearing loss
Whisper test A simple but eff ective crude assessment of hearing: whisper numbers
in one ear while blocking the other. Ask your patient to repeat the number. Make sure
that failure is not from misunderstanding.
Tuning fork tests Rinne: Hold a vibrating tuning fork (512Hz or 256Hz) on the mas-
toid to test bone conduction (BC). When the sound is no longer audible move it in
front of the ear with the prongs perpendicular to the auditory canal to test air con-
duction (AC). If there is no conductive defi cit (ie in normal hearing or sensorineural
hearing loss), AC is better than BC and the patient will be able to hear the note again.
This is a ‘Rinne positive’ result. If BC is better than AC (Rinne negative), this indicates
conductive deafness >20dB. A false-negative may occur in severe sensorineural hear-
ing loss (SNHL) as the contralateral cochlea picks up the sound by bone conduction.
Weber: With the vibrating tuning fork on the vertex or forehead, ask the patient
which ear the sound is louder in. Sound localizes to the aff ected ear with conductive
loss (>10dB loss), to the contralateral ear in SNHL, and to the midline if both ears are
normal (or if bilateral SNHL).
Conductive deafness Causes: Wax (remove, eg by syringing with warm water af-
ter softening with olive oil drops), otosclerosis, otitis media, or glue ear (OHCS p546).
Chronic sensorineural deafness Often due to accumulated environmental noise
toxicity, presbyacusis, or inherited disorders. Presbyacusis: Loss of acuity for high-
frequency sounds starts before 30yrs old. We do not usually notice it until hearing
of speech is aff ected. Hearing is most aff ected in the presence of background noise.
Hearing aids are the usual treatment.
Sudden sensorineural deafness Get an ENT opinion today (steroids may cure)!
Causes: Noise exposure; gentamicin/other toxin; mumps; acoustic neuroma; MS;
stroke; vasculitis; TB. Tests: ESR, FBC, LFT, pANCA, viral titres and TB (see BOX ‘Diagnostic
tests for TB’, p394); evoked response audiometry; CXR; MRI; lymph node and naso-
pharyngeal biopsy for culture.
Tinnitus
This ringing or buzzing in the ears is common, and may cause depression or insomnia.
Investigate unilateral tinnitus fully to exclude an acoustic neuroma (p462).
Causes Inner ear damage and hearing loss (leading to auditory cortex hyper-excit-
ability), wax, excess noise, head injury, otitis media, post-stapedectomy, Ménière’s,
anaemia (if pulsatile then think of carotid artery stenosis or dissection, AV fi stulae,
and glomus jugulare tumours). Drugs: Aspirin (reversible), loop diur etics, aminogly-
cosides. Mean age at onset: 40–50yrs. :≈1:1.
Management Exclude serious causes. Psychological support is very important:
reassure that tinnitus does not mean madness or serious disease and that it often
improves in time. Cognitive therapy helps, as do ‘tinnitus coping training’ and pa-
tient support groups. Drugs are disappointing: anticonvulsants (eg carbamazepine)
are not of benefi t; misoprostol appears to help (small-scale trials only); hypnotics
at night may be of some benefi t. Avoid tranquillizers, particularly if depressed (use
tricyclic antidepr essants here). If Ménière’s disease is the cause, betahistine helps
only a few. Masking may give relief: white noise (like an off -tuned radio) is given
via a noise generator worn like a post-aural hearing aid. Hearing aids may help by
amplifying desirable sounds. Cochlear nerve section is a drastic option that can
relieve disabling tinnitus in 25% but at the expense of deafness.

Bittersweet symphony
German composer Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827) began to lose his hearing
from his early 30s—fi rst high-frequency sounds were lost, associated with debili-
tating tinnitus: ‘My ears sing and buzz continually, day and night. I can truly say
that I am living a wretched life...in my profession it is a frightful state.’ However,
despite becoming profoundly deaf by the age of 44, he continued to compose and
perform throughout his auditory decline. As deafness crept into the ears of the
French composer, Gabriel Fauré (1845–1924), he composed less, but only after los-
ing his hearing did he manage to overcome his previous fear of writing a string
quartert, telling his wife ‘This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made fa-
mous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrifi ed of it’. They are
not the only masters of their fi eld to overcome auditory impairment; so did cardi-
ologist Helen Taussig (see p92).

Acute bilateral leg weakness
It is crucial to establish a diagnosis quickly to avoid permanent disability. Look for
specifi c patterns (see later in topic) and ask these questions to help elicit the diagnosis:
1 Where is the lesion? • Are the legs fl accid or spastic? (ie LMN or UMN?) • Is there
sensory loss?A sensory level usually means spinal cord disease. • Is there loss of
bowel or bladder control? (Lesion more likely to be in the conus medullaris or
cauda equina.)
2 What is the lesion? • Was onset sudden or rapidly progressive? This is an emer-
gency; it suggests cord compression so get urgent help (see next paragraph). • Are
there any signs of infection (eg tender spine, T°, WCC, ESR, CRP: extradural abscess)?
Cord compression (See also p528.) Symptoms: Bilateral leg weakness (arm weak-
ness—often less severe—suggests a cervical cord lesion, see p508) a sensory level ±
preceding back pain (see p542). Bladder (and anal) sphincter involvement is late and
manifests as hesitancy, frequency, and, later, as painless retention. Signs: Look for
a motor, refl ex, and sensory level, with normal fi ndings above the level of the lesion,
LMN signs at the level (especially in cervical lesions), and UMN signs below the level
(but remember tone and refl exes are usually reduced in acute cord compression;
OHCS p756). Causes: Secondary malignancy (breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney)
in the spine is commonest. Rarer: infection (epidural abscess), cervical disc prolapse,
haematoma (warfarin), intrinsic cord tumour, atlanto–axial subluxation, myeloma.
 : Transverse myelitis, MS, carcinomatous meningitis, cord vasculitis (PAN, syphilis),
spinal artery thrombosis or aneurysm, trauma, Guillain–Barré syndrome (p702). In-
vestigations: Do not delay imaging at any cost. Spinal x-rays are unreliable; MRI is
the defi nitive modality. Biopsy or surgical exploration may be needed to identify the
nature of any mass. Do a CXR (primary lung malignancy, lung secondaries, TB). Bloods:
FBC, ESR, B12, syphilis serology, U&E, LFT, PSA, serum electrophoresis. Treatment: Give
urgent dexamethasone in malignancy (p528) while considering more specifi c thera-
py, eg radiotherapy or chemotherapy ± decompressive laminectomy; which is most
appropriate depends on tumour type, quality of life, and likely prognosis. Epidural
abscesses must be surgically decompressed and antibiotics given.
Cauda equina and conus medullaris lesions The big diff erence between these
lesions and those high up in the cord is that leg weakness is fl accid and arefl exic,
not spastic and hyperrefl exic. Causes: As above, plus congenital lumbar disc disease
and lumbosacral nerve lesions. Signs: Conus medullaris lesions feature mixed UMN/
LMN signs, leg weakness, early urinary retention and constipation, back pain, sacral
sensory disturbance and erectile dysfunction. Cauda equina lesions feature back
pain and radicular pain down the legs; asymmetrical, atrophic, arefl exic paralysis of
the legs; sensory loss in a root distribution; and sphincter tone; do PR.
Other patterns of leg weakness
Unilateral foot drop: DM, common peroneal nerve palsy, stroke, prolapsed disc, MS.
Weak legs with no sensory loss: MND, polio, para sagittal meningioma (an exception
to the rule that weak legs mean cord or distal lesion).
Chronic spastic paraparesis: MS, cord primary malignancy/metastasis, MND, syrin-
gomyelia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334), hereditary spastic
paraparesis, taboparesis (tertiary syphilis, see p412), histiocytosis X, parasites (eg
schistosomiasis).
Chronic fl accid paraparesis: Peripheral neuro pathy, myopathy.
Absent knee jerks and extensor plantars: (Ie combined LMN or UMN signs.) Com-
bined cervical and lumbar disc disease, conus medullaris lesions, MND, myeloradicu-
litis, Friedreich’s ataxia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, taboparesis.4
4 Tertiary syphilis (p412): in tabes dorsalis the aff erent pathways from muscle spindles are lost, with
reduced tone and tendon refl exes (without weakness). Later, additional involvement of the pyramidal
tracts causes taboparesis—a spastic paraparesis with the peculiar combination of extensor plantars
(from the taboparesis) and absent tendon reflexes (from the tabes dorsalis).

Gait disorders
Spastic: Stiff , circumduction of legs ± scuffi ng of the toe of the shoes: UMN lesions.
Extrapyramidal: Flexed posture, shuffl ing feet, slow to start, postural instability,
eg Parkinson’s disease.
Apraxic: Pathognomonic ‘gluing-to-the-fl oor’ on attempting walking or a wide-
based unsteady gait with a tendency to fall, like a novice on an ice-rink. Seen in
normal pressure hydroc ephalus and multi-infarct states.
Ataxic: Wide-based; falls; cannot walk heel-to-toe. Caused by cerebellar lesions
(eg MS, posterior fossa tumours, alcohol, phenytoin toxicity); proprioceptive sen-
sory loss (eg sensory neuropathy,  B12). Often worse in the dark or with eyes closed.
Myopathic: Waddling gait, cannot climb steps or stand from sitting due to hip
girdle weakness.
Psychogenic: Suspect if there is a bizarre gait not conforming to any pattern of
organic gait disturbance and without any signs when examined on the couch.
Tests Spinal X-rays; MRI; FBC; ESR; syphilis serology; serum B12; U&E; LFT; PSA; serum
electrophoresis; CXR; LP; EMG; muscle ± sural nerve biopsy.
Non-neurological considerations in paralysed patients
Avoid pressure sores by turning and review weight-bearing areas often. Use ap-
propriate pressure-relieving mattresses/cushions. Prevent thrombosis in para-
lysed limbs by frequent passive movement, pressure stockings, and LMWH (p350).
Bladder care is vital; catheterization is only one option (do not control inconti-
nence by decreasing fl uid intake). Bowel evacuation may be manual or aided by
suppositories; increasing dietary fi bre intake may help. Exercise of unaff ected or
partially paralysed limbs is important to avoid unnecessary loss of function.

Abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia)
These are characterized by impairment of the planning, control, or execution of
movement. They can have multiple manifestations:
Tremor Note frequency, amplitude, and exacerbating factors (stress; fatigue).
• Rest tremor: Abolished on voluntary movement. Cause: parkinsonism (p494).
• Intention tremor: Irregular, large-amplitude, worse at the end of purposeful acts, eg
fi nger-pointing or using a remote control. Cause: cerebellar damage (eg MS, stroke).
• Postural tremor: Absent at rest, present on maintained posture (arms out stretched)
and may persist (but is not worse) on movement. Causes: benign essential tremor
(autosomal dominant; improves with alcohol), thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, -agonists.
• Re-emergent tremor: Postural tremor developing after a delay of ~10s. Causes:
Parkinson’s disease (don’t mistake for essential tremor).
Chorea Non-rhythmic, jerky, purposeless movements fl itting from one place to
another—eg facial grimacing, raising the shoulders, fl exing/extending the fi ngers.
Causes: Huntington’s disease, Syden ham’s chorea (rare complication of group A
streptococcal infection). Worsened by levodopa.
Hemiballismus Large-amplitude, fl inging hemichorea (aff ects proximal muscles)
contralateral to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (often elderly diabet-
ics). Recovers spontaneously over months.
Athetosis Slow, sinuous, confl uent, purposeless movements (especially digits,
hands, face, tongue), often diffi cult to distinguish from chorea. Causes: Common-
est is cerebral palsy (OHCS p214). Most other ‘athetoid’ patterns may now be better
classed as dystonias. Pseudoathetosis: Caused by severe proprioceptive loss.
Tics Brief, repeated, stereotyped movements which patients may suppress for a
while. Tics are common in children (and usually resolve). In Tourette’s syndrome
(p700), motor and vocal tics occur. Consider psychological support, clonazepam or
clonidine if tics are severe (haloperidol may help but risks tardive dyskinesia).
Myoclonus Sudden involuntary focal or general jerks arising from cord, brainstem,
or cerebral cortex, seen in metabolic problems, neurodegenerative disease (eg lysoso-
mal storage enzyme defects), CJD (p696), and myoclonic epilepsies (infantile spasms).
Benign essential myoclonus: Childhood onset with frequent generalized myoclonus,
without progression. Often autosomal dominant. It may respond to valproate,
clonazepam, or piracetam. Asterixis (‘metabolic fl ap’): Jerking (~1–2 jerks/sec) of
outstretched hands, worse with wrists extended, from loss of extensor tone—ie inco-
ordination between fl exors and extensors (=‘negative myoclonus’). Causes: Liver or
kidney failure, Na+, CO2, gabapentin, thalamic stroke (consider if unilateral).
Tardive syndromes Delayed onset yet potentially irreversible symptoms oc-
curing after chronic exposure to dopamine antagonists (eg antipsychotics, an-
tiemetics). Classifi cation: •Tardive dyskinesia: orobuccolingual, truncal, or
choreiform movements, eg vacuous chewing and grimacing movements. •Tardive
dystonia: sustained, stereotyped muscle spasms of a twisting or turning charac-
ter, eg retrocollis and back arching/opisthotonic posturing. •Tardive akathisia:
sense of restlessness or unease ± repetitive, purposeless movements (stereotyp-
ies, eg pacing). •Tardive myoclonus. •Tardive tourettism (p700). •Tardive tremor.
Treating tardive dyskinesia: Gradually withdraw neuroleptics and wait 3–6 months.
Tetrabenazine may help. Quetiapine, olanzapine, and clozapine are examples of atyp-
ical antipsychotics that are less likely to cause tardive syndromes.

Dystonia
Dystonia describes prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal posture or
repetitive movements.
Idiopathic generalized dystonia: Childhood-onset dystonia often starting in one
leg with ipsilateral progression over 5–10yrs. Autosomal dominant inheritance is
common (DYT1 deletion). Exclude Wilson’s disease and dopa-responsive dystonia
(needs an L-dopa trial). Anticholinergics and muscle relaxants may help. Deep
brain stimulation for refractory, disabling symptoms.
Focal dystonias: Confi ned to one part of the body, eg spasmodic torticollis (head
pulled to one side), blepharospasm (involuntary contraction of orbicularis oculi,
OHCS p417), writer’s cramp. Focal dystonias in adults are typically idiopathic, and
rarely generalize. They are worsened by stress. Patients may develop a geste an-
tagoniste to try to resist the dystonic posturing (eg a touch of the fi nger to the jaw
in spasmodic torticollis). Injection of botulinum toxin into the overactive muscles
is usually eff ective.
Acute dystonia: (fi g 10.14) May occur on starting many drugs, including neuro-
leptics and some anti-emetics (eg metoclopramide, cyclizine). There is torticollis
(head pulled back), trismus (oromandibular spasm), and/or oculogyric crisis (eyes
drawn up). You may mistake this for tetanus or meningitis, but such reacti ons
rapidly disappear after a dose of an antic holinergic, see p843.

St Vitus’s dance
Throughout the middle ages, Europe was plagued by epidemics of ‘dancing mania’,
in which affl icted individuals were described to have danced wildly, displaying
strange contortions and convulsions until they collapsed from exhaustion. If the
affl icted touched a relic of St Vitus they were miraculously cured: observing this,
Paracelsus, 16th-century Swiss-German physician and philosopher, described the
phenomenon of chorea Sancti Viti (‘St Vitus’s dance’). There may have been an in-
fectious component, although mass hysteria induced by religious cults that swept
across medieval Europe seems a more likely cause. Chorea was subsequently
used as a general term for large-amplitude involuntary movements before be-
ing further refi ned by physicians such as Sydenham (though he did not connect
his eponymous chorea seen in rheumatic fever with an infectious trigger) and
Charcot. Nowaways, a more frequent cause of involuntary movements with be-
havioural disturbance is NMDA-receptor antibody encephalitis, the impact of which
was documented in Susannah Cahalan’s excellent 2012 autobiography Brain on
Fire: My Month of Madness.

Stroke: clinical features and acute management
Infarction or bleeding into the brain manifests with sudden-onset focal CNS signs.
Someone in the UK has a stroke every 3.5 minutes; 1 in 4 of those will die within a year
and half of survivors will have a permanent disability.
Causes • Small vessel occlusion/cerebral microangiopathy or thrombosis in situ.
• Cardiac emboli (AF; endocarditis; MI—see BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’, p473). •
Atherothromboembolism (eg from carotids). • CNS bleeds (BP, trauma, aneurysm
rupture, anticoagulation, thrombolysis). Other causes: Consider in younger pa-
tients: sudden BP drop by ≥40mmHg (most likely to aff ect the boundary zone be-
tween vascular beds), carotid artery dissection (spontaneous, or from neck trauma
or fi bromuscular dysplasia), vasculitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478), venous
sinus thrombosis (p480), anti phos pho lipid syndrome, thrombophilia (p374), Fabry
disease (p698), CADASIL.5
Diff erentials Head injury, hypo/hyperglycaemia, subdural haemorrhage, intracranial
tumours, hemiplegic migraine, post-ictal (Todd’s palsy), CNS lymphoma, Wernicke’s
encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cerebral ab-
scesses, mycotic aneurysm, drug overdose (if comatose).
Modifi able risk factors BP, smoking, DM, heart disease (valvular, ischaemic, AF),
peripheral vascular disease, PCV, carotid bruit, combined OCP, lipids, alcohol use,
clotting (eg plasma fi brinogen, antithrombin III, p374), homocysteine, syphilis.
Signs Worst at onset. Pointers to bleeding (unreliable!): meningism, severe head-
ache, coma. Pointers to ischaemia: carotid bruit, AF, past TIA, IHD. Cerebral infarcts:
(50%.) Depending on site there may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia—
initially fl accid (fl oppy limb, falls like a dead weight when lifted), becoming spastic
(UMN); dysphasia; homonymous hemianopia; visuo-spatial defi cit. Brainstem in-
farcts: (25%.) Varied; include quadriplegia, disturbances of gaze and vision, locked-
in syndrome (aware, but unable to respond). Lacunar infarcts: (25%). Basal ganglia,
internal capsule, thalamus, and pons.) Five syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure mo-
tor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, and dysarthria/clumsy hand. Cognition/conscious-
ness are intact except in thalamic strokes.
Acute management  Protect the airway: This avoids hypoxia/aspiration.
• Maintain homeostasis: Blood glucose: keep between 4–11 mmol/L. Blood pressure:
only treat if there is a hypertensive emergency (eg encephalopathy or aortic dissec-
tion) or thrombolysis is considered (ideally aim for 185/110) as treating even very
high BPS may impair cerebral perfusion.
• Screen swallow: ‘Nil by mouth’ until this is done (but keep hydrated).
• CT/MRI within 1h: Essential if: thrombolysis considered, high risk of haemorrhage
(GCS, signs of ICP, severe headache, meningism, progressive symptoms, bleeding
tendency or antic oagulated), or unusual presentation (eg fl uctuating consciousness,
fever). Otherwise imaging less urgent (aim <24h). Diff usion-weighted MRI is most
sensitive for an acute infarct, but CT helps rule out primary haemorrhage (fi g 10.15).
• Antiplatelet agents: Once haemorrhagic stroke is excluded, give aspirin 300mg
(continue for 2 weeks, then switch to long-term antithrombotic treatment, p472).
• Thrombolysis: Consider this as soon as haemorrhage has been excluded, provided
the onset of symptoms was ≤4.5h ago.2 The benefi ts of thrombolysis outweigh the
risks within this window, though best results are within 90min. Alteplase is the
agent of choice and must be given by trained staff , ideally within an expert acute
stroke team.  Always do CT 24h post-lysis to identify bleeds.6 CI to thrombolysis:
• Major infarct or haemorrhage on CT. • Mild/non-disabling defi cit. • Recent sur-
gery, trauma, or artery or vein puncture at uncompressible site. •Previous CNS
bleed. • AVM/aneurysm. • Severe liver disease, varices, or portal hypertension. • Sei-
zures at presentation. • Blood glucose (<3 or >22). • Stroke or serious head injury
in last 3 months. • GI or urinary tract haemorrhage in the last 21 days. •Known
clotting disorder. • Anticoagulants or INR >1 . 7. • Platelets <100 ≈ 109/L. • History of
intracranial neoplasm. • Rapidly improving symptoms. • BP >180/105.
• Thrombectomy: Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy provides additional
benefi t for those with large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation.
 Admit to an acute stroke unit: multidisciplinary care improves outcomes (p474).

Act FAST
Several public health measures have aimed to increase awareness of stroke and
the seriousness of the condition: the relabelling of stroke as a ‘brain attack,’ and
via the graphic mass media FAST campaign = Facial asymmetry, Arm/leg weak-
ness, Speech diffi culty, Time to call 999. The publicity surrounding this acronym has
increased recognition of the symptoms of stroke and emphasized the urgency of
seeking medical help; following the introduction of the campaign in 2011 the NHS
in England saw a 24% rise in stroke-related 999 calls.

Stroke: investigation and prevention
Primary prevention (Ie before any stroke.)
Control risk factors (p470): look for and treat hypertension, DM, lipids (p690),
cardiac disease (see BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’) and help quit smoking (see
p93). Exercise helps (HDL, glucose tolerance). Use lifelong anticoagulation in AF
(see BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’) and prosthetic heart valves. • For prevention
post-TIA see p476.
Secondary prevention (Ie preventing further strokes.)
Control risk factors (as Primary prevention mentioned above): there is a considerable
advantage from lowering blood pressure and cholesterol (even if not particularly raised).
Antiplatelet agents after stroke: (See BOX ‘Antiplatelets’.) If no primary haemorrhage
on CT, give 2 weeks of aspirin 300mg, then switch to long-term clopidogrel monother-
apy. If this is CI or not tolerated then give low dose aspirin plus slow-release dipyrida-
mole. Anticoagulation after stroke from AF: See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’.
Tests (See p470 for imaging.) Investigate promptly to identify risk factors for fur-
ther strokes, but consider whether results will aff ect management. Look for:
• Hypertension. Look for retinopathy (p560), nephropathy, or cardiomegaly on CXR.
• Cardiac source of emboli. (See BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’.) 24h ECG to look
for AF (p130). CXR may show an enlarged left atrium. Echocardiogram may reveal
mural thrombus due to AF or a hypokinetic segment of cardiac muscle post-MI.
It may also show valvular lesions in infective endocarditis or rheumatic heart
disease. Transo esophageal echo is more sensitive than transthoracic.
• Carotid artery stenosis. Do carotid Doppler US ± CT/MRI angiography. Benefi ts and
risks of revascularization should be individualized by an expert but generally most
with ≥ 70% stenosis and life expectancy ≥ 5yrs will benefi t while some (especially
) will benefi t with 50–69% stenosis7 (see p476). Carotid endarterectomy is the
procedure of choice; endovascular carotid artery angioplasty with stenting is an
alternative for those unfi t for surgery and achieves similar long-term outcomes but
has higher peri-procedure stroke and mortality rates.
• Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and hyperhomocysteinaemia.
• Vasculitis. ESR, ANCA (p556). VDRL to look for active, untreated syphilis (p412).
• Prothrombotic states, eg thrombophilia (p374), antiphospholipid syndrome (p554).
• Hyperviscosity, eg polycythaemia (p366), sickle-cell disease (p340).
• Thrombocytopenia and other bleeding disorders.
• Genetic tests. CADASIL (p470); Fabry disease (p698).
Prognosis Overall mortality: 60 000/yr; UK 20% at 1 month, then 10%/yr. Full recov-
ery: ≤ 40%. Drows i ness ≈ poor prognosis. Avoid pressure ulcers (fi g 10.16).
7 Interventions for 50–69% stenoses can be justifi able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In
particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto-
matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50–69% range as
compared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists’ Collaborative Group) criteria.

Cardiac causes of stroke
Cardioembolic causes are the source of stroke in >30% of patients, and may be
hinted at if there are bilateral infarcts on imaging.
Non-valvular atrial fi brillation: (p130) Associated with an overall risk of stroke of
4.5%/yr, and ischaemic strokes in AF carry a worse prognosis.
• CHA2DS2VASC score (p131) can be used to calculate risk of stroke in patients with
AF. Off er anticoagulation in patients with a score of 2 or above. Take bleeding
risk into account: calculate the risk of major bleeding using the HAS-BLED score.
Caution and regular review of oral anticoagulants are required if the HAS-BLED
score >3.  Do not off er stroke prevention therapy in patients with AF if <65y and
CHA2DS2VASC score is 0 for men or 1 for women.
• Anticoagulation (see p350) can be commenced 2wks after a stroke (or from
7–10d if clinically and radiologically small). Off er a direct oral anticoagulant
(DOAC) or warfarin (p350), following a discussion of risks and benefi ts.
Other cardiac sources of emboli: • Cardioversion. • Prosthetic valves. • Acute
myocardial infarct with large left ventricular wall motion abnormalities on
echocardiography. • Patent foramen ovale/septal defects. • Cardiac surgery. • In-
fective endocarditis (gives rise to septic emboli; 20% of those with endocarditis
present with CNS signs).
Antiplatelets: mechanism of action

Re-enablement after stroke
Coordinated multidisciplinary care on a specialized stroke unit is essential, and leads
to better patient outcomes. Rehabilitation must be started early post-stroke in order
to maximize improvement and prevent complications related to immobility such as
pressure sores, aspiration pneumonia, constipation, and contractures. Ongoing input
after discharge consolidates inpatient gains and helps align the individual with their
previous capability. It also helps with depression—both in the patient and their carer.
Setting achievable goals and acknowledging the patient’s own agenda is key.
Imperatives for re-enablement
• Watch the patient swallow a small volume of water; if signs of aspiration (a cough
or voice change) make nil by mouth until formal assessment by a speech therapist.
Use IV fl uids, then semi-solids (eg jelly; avoid soups and crumbly food). Avoid early
NG tube feeds; these may be needed to safeguard nutrition in those with swallowing
problems that persist beyond the fi rst 2–3d. If swallowing fails to recover, consider
benefi ts of enteral feeding tube placement (p759). Speech therapists skilled in assess-
ing swallowing diffi culties are invaluable here.
• Avoid further injury: minimize falls risk and take care when lifting the patient not
to damage their shoulders.
• Ensure good bladder and bowel care through frequent toileting. Avoid early cath-
eterization which may prevent return to continence.
• Position to minimize spasticity (occurs in ~40%). Get prompt physiotherapy. Splints
and botulinum toxin injections are helpful for focal spasticity.
• Monitor progress: eg measure time taken to sit up and transfer to chair.
• Monitor mood: in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability (sobbing unprovoked
by sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system), tricyclics or
fl uoxetine may help.
• Engage the patient in their own recovery by making physiotherapy fun. Swimming
(a hemiplegic arm may be supported on a special fl oat), music, and video games are
all enjoyable and  recovery through promoting cerebral reorganization. Constraint
of the good arm may be helpful.
Involve the carer/spouse with all aspects of care-giving. Good rehab saves lives.
Tests Asking to point to a named part of the body tests perceptual function. Copy-
ing matchstick patterns tests spatial ability. Dressing or copying a clock face tests
for apraxia (p86). Picking out and naming easy objects from a pile tests for agnosia
(acuity OK, but cannot mime use; guesses are way-out, semantically, and phonetically).
Screen for depression (low mood; inability to feel pleasure or to concentrate).
End-of-life decisions See p13.

Assessing dependence in daily life
Handicap entails inability to carry out social functions. ‘A disadvantage for a given
individual, resulting from an impairment or disability, that limits or prevents the
fulfi lment of a role.’ Two people with the same impairment (eg paralysed arm)
may have diff erent disabilities (table 10.5, eg one may be able to dress but the
other cannot). Disabilities are likely to determine quality of future life. Treatment
is often best aimed at reducing disability, not curing disease. For example, Velcro®
fasteners in place of buttons may enable a person to dress.

Barthel’s paradox
The more we contemplate Barthel’s eulogy of independence, the more we see it as
a mirage refl ecting a greater truth about human aff airs: there is no such thing
as independence—only interdependence—and in fostering this interdependence
lies our true vocation:
No man is an Island, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a
part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse,
as well as if a promontorie were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of
thine owne were. Any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in
mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls: It tolls
for thee.
John Donne 1572–1631; Meditation XVII.

Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)
This is an ischaemic (usually embolic) neurological event with symptoms lasting <24h
(often much shorter).  Without intervention, more than 1 in 12 patients will go on to
have a stroke within a week, so prompt management is imperative.
Signs Specifi c to the arterial territory involved (p450). Amaurosis fugax occurs
when the retinal artery is occluded, causing unilateral progressive vision loss ‘like a
curtain descending’. Global events (eg syncope, dizziness) are not typical of TIAs. At-
tacks may be single or many; multiple highly stereotyped attacks (‘crescendo’ TIAs)
suggest a critical intra cranial stenosis (commonly the superior division of the MCA).
Causes (See p470.) • Atherothromboembolism from the carotid is the chief cause:
listen for bruits (though not a sensitive test). • Cardioembolism: mural thrombus
post-MI or in AF, valve disease, prosthetic valve (p473). • Hyperviscosity: eg poly-
cythaemia, sickle-cell anaemia, myeloma. • Vasculitis is a rare, non-embolic cause of
TIA symptoms (eg cranial arteritis, PAN, SLE, syphilis, etc.).
Diff erentials Hypoglycaemia, migraine aura (p458), focal epilepsy (symptoms
spread over seconds and often include twitching and jerking), hyperventilation, reti-
nal bleeds. Rare mimics of TIA: Malignant hypertension, MS (paroxysmal dysarthria),
intra cranial tumours, peripheral neuropathy, phaeochromocytoma, somatization.
Tests FBC, ESR, U&Es, glucose, lipids, CXR, ECG, carotid Doppler ± angiography, CT or
diff usion-weighted MRI, echoc ardio gram.
Treatment
• Control cardiov ascular risk factors: Optimize: BP (cautiously lower; aim for
<140/85mmHg, p140); hyperlipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); help to stop smoking (p93).
• Antiplatelet drugs: As with stroke, give aspirin 300mg OD for 2wks, then switch to
clopidogrel 75mg OD. If this is contraindicated or not tolerated, give aspirin 75mg
OD combined with slow-release dipyridamole.
• Anticoagulation indications: Cardiac source of emboli (see p473).
• Carotid endarterectomy: Perform within 2wks of fi rst presentation if 70–99% ste-
nosis8 and operative risk is acceptable (higher risk in: , >75y, systolic BP, contralat-
eral artery occl uded; ipsilateral carotid syphon/external carotid stenosed). Do not
stop aspirin preoperatively. Surgery is preferred to endovascular carotid artery an-
gioplasty with stenting in those fi t enough to tolerate due to higher peri-procedure
stroke and mortality rates with stenting.
Driving Prohibited for at least 1 month, see p158.
Prognosis Long-term risks of stroke or cardiovascular events following TIAs are de-
pendent on underlying vascular risk factors: calculate using the ABCD2 score (see BOX
and table 10.6).
8 Interventions for 50–69% stenoses can be justifi able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In
particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto-
matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50–69% range as
compared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists’ Collaborative Group) criteria.

When should TIA lead to emergency referral?
The ABCD2 score is a helpful tool to stratify which patients are at higher risk of hav-
ing a stroke following a suspected TIA (table 10.6).
Table 10.6 The ABCD2 score
Age ≥60 yrs old 1 point
Blood pressure ≥140/90 1 point
Clinical features
Unilateral weakness 2 points
Speech disturbance without weakness 1 point
Duration of symptoms
Symptoms lasting ≥1h 2 points
Symptoms lasting 10–59min 1 point
Diabetes 1 point
A score of ≥4 indicates that the patient is at high risk of an early stroke, and must
be assessed by a specialist within 24h. A score of ≥6 strongly predicts a stroke (8 . 1%
within 2 days, 35.5% in the next week). Other factors that suggest increased risk
are: • AF • >1 TIA in a week • TIA while anticoagulated. Crucially, risk is lowest if the
patient is treated in a specialized stroke unit (p474).

individuals at high early risk of stroke after transient ischaemic attack’, 29–36.

Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH)
Spontaneous bleeding into the subarachnoid space, often catastrophic (table 10.7).
Incidence 9/100 000/yr; typical age: 35–65.
Symptoms Sudden-onset excruciating headache, typically occipital—like a ‘thun-
derclap’. Vomiting, collapse, seizures, and coma often follow. Coma/drowsiness may
last for days. Some patients report a preceding, ‘sentinel’ headache, perhaps due to
a small warning leak from the off ending aneurysm (~6%).
Signs Neck stiff ness; Kernig’s sign (takes 6h to develop); retinal, subhyaloid and vit-
reous bleeds (=Terson’s syndrome; mortality ≈ 5). Focal neurology at presentation
may suggest site of aneurysm (eg pupil changes indicating a IIIrd nerve palsy with
a posterior communicating artery aneurysm) or intracerebral haematoma. Later
defi cits suggest complications (see later in topic).
Causes • Berry aneurysm rupture (80%). Common sites: junctions of poster ior
communicating with the internal carotid (see fi g 10.3, p451) or of the anterior com-
municating with the anterior cerebral artery, or bifurcation of the middle cerebral
artery (fi g 10.17). 15% are multiple. •Arterio-venous malforma tions (15%).• Other
causes; encephalitis, vasculitis, tumour (invading blood vessels), idiopathic.
Risk factors Previous aneurysmal SAH (new aneurysms form, old ones get bigger),
smoking, alcohol misuse, BP, bleeding disorders, SBE (mycotic aneurysm), family his-
tory (3–5x risk of SAH in close relatives). Polycystic kidneys, aortic coarctation, and
Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (p149) are all associated with berry aneurysms.
Diff erentials Meningitis (p822), migraine (p458), intracerebral bleed, cortical vein
thrombosis (p480), dissection of a carotid or vertebral artery, benign thunderclap
headache (triggered by Valsalva manoeuvre, eg cough, coitus).
Tests • Urgent CT: Detects >95% of SAH within the 1st 24h (fi g 10.18). • Consider
LP: If CT Ωve but the history is very suggestive of SAH (and no CI: p768). This needs to
be done >12h after headache onset to allow breakdown of RBCs so that a positive
sample is xanthrochromic (yellow, due to bilirubin: diff erentiaties between old blood
from SAH vs a ‘bloody tap’).
Management Refer all proven SAH to neurosurgery immediately.
• Re-examine CNS often; chart BP, pupils, and GCS (p788). Repeat CT if deteriorating.
• Maintain cerebral perfusion by keeping well hydrated, but aim for SBP <160mmHg.
• Nimodipine (60mg/4h PO for 3wks, or 1mg/h IVI) is a Ca2+ antagonist that reduces
vasospasm and consequent morbidity from cerebral ischaemia.
• Surgery: endovascular coiling vs surgical clipping (requiring craniotomy): the
decision depends on the accessibility and size of the aneurysm, though coiling
is preferred where possible (fewer complications, better outcomes). Do catheter
or CT angiography to identify single vs multiple aneurysms before intervening.
Newer techniques such as balloon remodelling and fl ow diversion can be helpful
in anatomically challenging aneurysms.
Complications Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death, and occurs in 20%,
often in the 1st few days. Cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm may cause a perma-
nent CNS defi cit, and is the commonest cause of morbidity. If this happens, surgery
is not helpful at the time but may be so later. Hydrocephalus, due to blockage of
arachnoid granulations, requires a ventricular or lumbar drain. Hyponatraemia is
common but should not be managed with fl uid restriction. Seek expert help.

Unruptured aneurysms: ‘the time-bomb in my head’
Bear in mind the old adage: ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fi x it’—usually, risks of pre-
ventive intervention outweigh any benefi ts, except perhaps in •young patients
(more years at risk, and surgery is twice as hazardous if >45yrs old) who have
•aneurysms >7mm in diameter, especially if located at the •junction of the inter-
nal carotid and the posterior communicating cerebral artery, or at the •rostral
basilar artery bifurcation, and especially if there is •uncontrolled hypertension or
a •past history of bleeds. Data from the 2003 International Study of Unruptured
Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) show that relative risk of rupture for an aneurysm
7–12mm across is 3.3 compared with aneurysms <7mm across; if the diameter is
>12mm, the relative risk is 17.

Intracranial venous thrombosis (IVT)
Thrombosis of the cerebral sinuses or veins causes cerebral infarction, though much
less commonly than arterial disease. Seizures are common and focal; they can com-
plicate diagnosis and post-ictal drowsiness may impair GCS assessment. Although
~80% will make a good functional recovery, death is mainly due to transtentorial
herniation from mass eff ect or oedema.9
Dural venous sinus thrombosis Most commonly sagittal sinus thrombosis (fi gs
10.19, 10.20; 47% of all IVT) or transverse sinus thrombosis (35%). Sagittal sinus
thrombosis often coexists if other sinuses are thrombosed. Symptom onset is gradu-
al (over days or weeks). Features are dependent on the sinus aff ected:
• Sagittal sinus: Heada che, vomiting, seizures, vision, papilloedema.
• Transverse sinus: Headache ± mastoid pain, focal CNS signs, seizures, papilloedema.
• Sigmoid sinus: Cerebellar signs, lower cranial nerve palsies.
• Inferior petrosal sinus: Vth and VIth cranial nerve palsies, with temporal and
retro-orbital pain (Gradenigo’s syndrome,. suggesting otitis media is the cause).
• Cavernous sinus: Often due to spread from facial pustules or foll iculitis, causing
headache, chemosis, oedematous eyelids, proptosis, painful ophthalmoplegia, fever.
Cortical vein thrombosis (CVT) Usually occurs with a sinus thrombus as it extends
into the cortical veins, causing infarction in a venous territory (fi g 10.21). These infarcts
give rise to stroke-like focal symptoms that develop over days. There are often seizures,
and an associated headache which may come on suddenly (thunderclap headache).
Causes Numerous, including anything that promotes a hypercoagulable state (p374).
Common causes: Pregnancy/puerperium, combined OCP, head injury, dehydration,
blood dyscrasias, tumours (local invasion/pressure), extracranial malignancy (hyperco-
agulability), recent LP. Other causes: Infection (meningitis, abscesses, otitis media, cer-
ebral malaria, TB), Drugs (eg antifi brinolytics, androgens), SLE, vasculitis, Crohn’s or UC.
Diff erential diagnosis Subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, in-
tracranial abscess, arterial infarction.
Investigations Exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage (if thunderclap headache,
p478) and meningitis (p822). Bloods: Thrombophilia screen. Imaging: CT/MRI venog-
raphy may show the absence of a sinus (fi g 10.19), though an absent transverse sinus
can be a normal variant. MRI T2-weighted gradient echo sequences can visualize
thrombus directly (fi g 10.20), and also identify haemorrhagic infarction. CT may be
normal early, but show a fi lling defect at ~1wk (delta sign). LP (if no CI): raised open-
ing pressure. CSF may be normal, or show RBCS and xanthochromia.
Management Seek expert help. Anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH and then
warfarin (INR 2–3) may benefi t even if there is secondary cerebral haemorrhage (un-
less otherwise CI). If there is deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation, endo-
vascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy may provide limited benefi t (but
not in those with large infarcts and impending herniation). ICP requires prompt at-
tention (p830); decompressive hemicraniectomy may prevent impending herniation.
9 Predictors of poor prognosis include: GCS score on admission <9, deep CVT location, CNS infection, malig-
nancy, intracranial haemorrhage, mental status abnormality, age >37 years, and .

venogram (MRV) could look normal at
fi rst glance: the hardest thing to see
in imaging is often that which is not

sinus is not seen because it is fi lled with
clot—a superior sagittal sinus thrombo-
sis. The arrows point to where it should

is in arterial anatomy, so this diagram is only a rough guide. The key point is to realize
that infarction that crosses boundaries between arterial territories may be venous
in origin.

Subdural haematoma
Consider this very treatable condition in all whose conscious level fl uctuates, and
also in those having an ‘evolving stroke’, especially if on anticoagulants. Bleeding
is from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses (vulnerable to decelera-
tion injury), resulting in accumulating haematoma between dura and arachnoid. This
gradually raises ICP, shifting midline structures away from the side of the clot and, if
untreated, eventual tentorial herniation and coning. Most subdurals are from trauma
but the trauma is often forgotten as it was so minor or so long ago (up to 9 months).
It can also occur without trauma (eg ICP; dural metasta ses). The elderly are most
susceptible, as brain atrophy makes bridging veins vulnerable. Other risk factors:
falls (epileptics, alcoholics); anticoagulation.
Symptoms Fluctuating level of consciousness (seen in 35%) ± insidious physical
or intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change, and unsteadiness.
Signs ICP (p830), seizures. Localizing neurological symptoms (eg unequal pupils,
hemiparesis) occur late, often >1 month after the injury.
Diff erentials Stroke, dementia, CNS masses (eg tumours, abscesses).
Imaging (fi g 10.22) CT/MRI shows clot ± midline shift (but beware bilateral isodense
clots). Look for crescent-shaped collection of blood over 1 hemisphere. The sickle-
shape diff erent iates subdural blood from extradural haemorrhage.
Management Reverse clotting abnormalities urgently. Surgical management de-
pends on the size of the clot, its chronicity, and the clinical picture: generally those
>10mm or with midline shift >5mm need evacuating (via craniotomy or burr hole
washout). Address the cause of the trauma (eg falls, abuse).
Extradural (epidural) haematoma
 Beware deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced
no loss of consciousness or after initial drowsiness post injury seems to have re-
solved. This lucid interval pattern is typical of extradural bleeds.
Cause Suspect after any traumatic skull fracure. Often due to a fractured temporal
or parietal bone causing laceration of the middle meningeal artery and vein, typically
after trauma to a temple just lateral to the eye. Any tear in a dural venous sinus will
also result in an extradural bleed. Blood accumulates between bone and dura.
Clinical features The lucid interval may last a few hours to a few days before a
bleed declares itself by GCS from rising ICP. Increasingly severe headache, vomit-
ing, confusion, and seizures follow, ± hemiparesis with brisk refl exes and an up-
going plantar. If bleeding contin ues, the ipsilateral pupil dilates, coma deepens,
bilateral limb weakness develops, and breathing becomes deep and irregular
(brainstem compression). Death follows a period of coma and is due to respiratory
arrest. Bradycardia and BP are late signs.
Diff erentials Epilepsy, carotid dissection, carbon monoxide poisoning.
Tests CT (fi g 10.23) shows a haematoma (often biconvex/lens-shaped; the blood
forms a more rounded shape compared with the sickle-shaped subdural haemato-
ma as the tough dural attachments to the skull keep it more localized). Skull X-ray
may be normal or show fracture lines crossing the course of the middle meningeal
vessels. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated.
Management Stabilize and transfer urgently (with skilled medical and nursing
escorts) to a neurosurgical unit for clot evacuation ± ligation of the bleeding ves-
sel. Care of the airway in an unconscious patient and measures to ICP often re-
quire intubation and ventilation (+ mannitol IVI, p831).
Prognosis Excellent if diagnosis and operation early. Poor if coma, pupil abnor-
malities, or decerebrate rigidity are present pre-op.

Fig 10.22 This image explains the cause
as well as the patho logy. On the patient’s
left, cerebral sulci are prominent and prior
to this adverse event would have been
even larger. The brain had shrunk within
the skull as a result of atherosclerosis, and
poor perfusion, leaving large suba rachnoid
spaces. A simple, quick rotation of the head
is enough to tear a bridging vein, causing
this acute subdural haematoma.
We thank Prof. Peter Scally

Fig 10.23 The blood (high attenu ation,
fusiform or biconvex collection) on the
right side is limited anteriorly by the coro-
nal suture and posteriorly by the lambdoid

sity collection on the left is causing scallop-

location of an arachnoid cyst; an incidental

Delirium (acute confusional state)
Delirium10 aff ects up to 50% of inpatients >65y, and is associated with a longer ad-
mission, more complications, and higher mortality. Look for an underlying cause
in any acute fl uctuating, baffl ing behaviour change; it may be an early indication of
treatable pathology (eg UTI).
Clinical features Globally impaired cognition, perception, and consciousness
which develops over hours/days, characterized by a marked memory defi cit, dis-
ordered or disorientated thinking, and reversal of the sleep–wake cycle. Some pa-
tients experience tactile or visual hallucinations. Delirium can be: •hyperactive,
with restlessness, mood lability, agitation, or aggression •hypoactive in which the
patient becomes slow and withdrawn or •mixed. Hypoactive and mixed delirium
are much harder to recognize: it is crucial to compare current behaviour to the
patient’s baseline (see BOX).
Risk factors >65y, dementia/previous cognitive impairment, hip fracture, acute ill-
ness, psychological agitation (eg pain).
Causes
• Surgery/post-GA.
• Systemic infection: pneumonia, UTI, malaria, wounds, IV lines.
• Intracranial infection or head injury.
• Drugs/drug withdrawal: opiates, levodopa, sedatives, recreational.
• Alcohol withdrawal (2–5d post-admission; LFTS, MCV; history of alcohol abuse).
• Metabolic: uraemia, liver failure, Na+ or glucose, Hb, malnutrition (beriberi, p268).
• Hypoxia: respiratory or cardiac failure.
• Vascular: stroke, myocardial infarction.
• Nutritional: thiamine, nicotinic acid, or B12 defi ciency.
Diff erentials Dementia (see BOX), anxiety, epilepsy: non-convulsive status epi-
lepticus is an underdiagnosed cause of impaired cognition and odd behaviour: con-
sider an EEG. Primary mental illness (eg schizophrenia) can also mimic delirium,
but this is rare on the wards (especially if no past history).
Tests Look for the cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U&E, LFT, blood glucose,
ABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, blood cultures); also consider ECG, malaria
fi lms, LP, EEG, CT.
Management As well as identifying and treating the underlying cause, aim to:3
• Reorientate the patient: explain where they are and who you are at each encounter.
Hunt down hearing aids/glasses. Visible clocks/calendars may help.
• Encourage visits from friends and family.
• Monitor fl uid balance and encourage oral intake . Be vigilant for constipation.
• Mobilize and encourage physical activity.
• Practise sleep hygeine: restrict daytime napping, minimize night-time disturbance.
• Avoid or remove catheters, IV cannulae, monitoring leads and other devices (they
increase infection risk and may get pulled out).
• Watch out for infection and physical discomfort/distress.
• Review medication and discontinue any unnecessary agents. Only use sedation if the
patient is a risk to their own/other patients’ safety (never use physical restraints).
Consider haloperidol 0.5–2mg, or chlorpromazine 50–100mg, PO if they will take it,
IM if not (p15). Wait 20min to judge eff ect—further doses can be given if needed.
NB: avoid chlorp romazine in the elderly and in alcohol withdrawal (p280); avoid
antipsychotics in those with Parkinson’s disease or Lewy body dementia.
Be aware that delirium may persist beyond the duration of the original illness by
several weeks in the elderly. Do not assume this must be dementia—provide support
and reassess 1–2 months later.
10 Delirium, from the Latin de (from) and lira (ridge between furrows), meaning ‘out of one’s furrow’.

Delirium vs dementia
One is often mistaken for the other, yet perhaps the interconnectedness of these
two conditions is greater than we realize: not only is dementia the leading risk
factor for delirium, but delirium itself confers a greater risk of subsequently de-
veloping dementia.4 It is likely that this is due to a number of factors: delirium is a
marker of vulnerability of the brain, and may also emphasize previously unrecog-
nized dementia symptoms. Furthermore, there may be direct causation through
the noxious insults incurred during an episode of delirium, which can lead to per-
manent neuronal damage.
In distinguishing the two conditions (not always an easy task) the presence of
inattention, distractibility, and disorganized thinking will all point you towards
delirium. But the fundamental question is ‘Has there been an acute change from
the patient’s cognitive baseline?’ Family or carer collateral reports are invalu-
able, but may not always be available. Document cognition in all patients >65y
admitted to hospital (eg AMTs, p64, many admission proformas allow for this).
This will then allow you to compare their admission score with subsequent assess-
ments and track any improvements, deteriorations, or fl uctuations in cognition
throughout the admission.

Dementia
A neurodegenerative syndrome with progressive decline in several cognitive do-
mains. The initial presentation is usually of memory loss over months or years (look
for other causes if over days/weeks). Prevalence increases with age: 20% of people
>80yrs are known to have dementia, yet probably only half of cases are diagnosed.
Diagnosis Is made by: History from the patient with a thorough collateral nar-
rative—ask about the timeline of decline and the domains aff ected. Non-cognitive
symptoms such as agitation, aggression, or apathy indicate late disease.5 Cognitive
testing: Use a validated dementia screen such as the AMTS (p64) or similar, plus short
tests of executive function and language. Carry out a mental state examination to
identify anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. Examination may identify a physical
cause, risk factors (eg for vascular dementia), or parkinsonism. Medication review
is important to exclude drug-induced cognitive impairment.
Investigations Look for reversible/organic causes: TSH/B12/folate (treat low-
normals, p334), thiamine (eg alcohol), Ca2+. Check MSU, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFT, and glu-
cose. An MRI (preferred to CT) can identify other reversible pathologies (eg subdural
haematoma, p482; normal-pressure hydrocephalus11), as well as underlying vascular
damage or structural pathology. Functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT) may help de-
lineate subtypes where diagnosis is not clear. Consider EEG in: suspected delirium,
frontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check
autoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic).
Subtypes • Alzheimer’s disease (AD): See p488. • Vascular dementia: (~25%.) Cu-
mulative eff ect of many small strokes: sudden onset and stepwise deterioration is
characteristic (but often hard to recognize). Look for evidence of arteriopathy (BP,
past strokes, focal CNS signs). Do not use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or me-
mantine in these patients. • Lewy body dementia: (15–25%.) Fluctuating cognitive
impairment, det ailed visual hallucinations, and later, parkinsonism (p494). Histol-
ogy is characterized by Lewy bodies (eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies)
in brainstem and neocortex. Avoid using antipsychotics in Lewy body dementia
(risk of SE, see p489). • Fronto-temporal dementia: Frontal and temporal atrophy
with loss of >70% of spindle neurons. Patients display executive impairment; be-
havioural/personality change; disinhibition; hyperorality, stereotyped behaviour, and
emotional unconcern. Episodic memory and spatial orientation are preserved until
later stages. Pick’s disease refers to the few fronto-temporal dementia patients who
have Pick inclusion bodies on histology (spherical clusters of tau-laden neurons).
Other causes Alcohol/drug abuse; repeated head trauma; pellagra (p268), Whip-
ple’s disease (p716); Huntington’s (p702); CJD (p696); Parkinson’s (p494); HIV; crypto-
coccosis (p408); familial autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s; CADASIL (p470).
Management Refer suspected or diagnosed dementia to integrated memory ser-
vices for further assessment and management. Medication: (p489). Avoid drugs that
impair cognition (eg neuroleptics, sedatives, tricyclics). Non-pharmacological inter-
ventions: Non-cognitive symptoms (eg agitation) may respond to measures such as
aromatherapy, multisensory stimulation, massage, music, and animal-assisted therapy.
Other considerations • Depression: Common. Try an SSRI (eg citalopram 10–20mg
OD) or, if severe, mirtazapine (15–45mg at night if eGFR >40). Cognitive behavioural
therapy can help with social withdrawal and catastrophic thinking. • Capacity: Can
the patient make decisions regarding medical or fi nancial aff airs? Wherever possible,
allow them to. Suggest making an advanced directive or appointing a Lasting Power
of Attorney in the early stages of the disease.
11 Dilated ventr icles without enlarged sulci. Signs: gait apraxia, incontinence, de m entia; CSF shunts help.

Who will care for the carers?
Our ageing population and improvements in medicine mean that we not only have
an increasing number of people with dementia in the UK, but that those people are
living longer with the disease in more advanced stages. Their needs become more
complex and they become increasingly dependent. Currently, informal (mostly fam-
ily) carers of people with dementia save the UK £11 billion a year. Yet this is not an
easy task: most dementia suff erers display behavioural or psychological symptoms,
which can be particularly distressing for the carer. Carer stress is inevitable and
causes morbidity and mortality. Ameliorate this with:
• A care coordinator (via Social Services or the local Old Age Community Mental
Healthcare Team); vital to coordinate the various teams and services available:
• Laundry services for soiled linen • Attendance allowance
• Car badge giving priority parking • Respite care in hospital
• Help from occupational therapist,district • Council tax rebate (forms
nurses, and community psychiatric nurses from local council offi ce).
• Day services can be invaluable for stimulating patients and providing regular,
much-needed breaks for carers.
• Moral support Support groups, telephone helplines, and charities can all ease the
burden, eg UK Alzheimer’s Disease Society.
• Combatting challenging behaviour: First rule out pain, infection, and depres-
sion. Then consider trazodone (50–300mg at night) or lorazepam (0.5–1mg/12–24h
PO). Haloperidol (0.5–4mg) can be useful in the short term.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
This leading cause of dementia is the big neuropsychiatric disorder of our times,
dominating the care of the elderly and the lives of their families who give up work,
friends, and ways of life to support relatives through the long fi nal years as they exit
into their ‘worlds of preoccupied emptiness’. Suspect AD in adults >40yrs with per-
sistent,12 progressive, and global cognitive impairment: visuo-spatial skill, memory,
verbal abilities, and executive function (planning) are all aff ected, unlike other de-
mentias which may aff ect certain domains but not others (identify which with neu-
ropsychometric tests). There is also anosognosia—a lack of insight into the problems
engendered by the disease, eg missed appointments, misunderstood conversations
or plots of fi lms, and mishandling of money. Later there may be irritability; mood dis-
turbance (depression or euphoria); behavioural change (eg aggression, wandering,
disinhibition); psychosis (hallucinations or delusions); agnosia (may not recognize
self in the mirror). There is no standard natural history. Cognitive impairment is
progressive, but non-cognitive symptoms may come and go over months. Eventually
many patients become sedentary, taking little interest in anything.
Cause Environmental and genetic factors both play a role. Accumulation of
-amyloid peptide, a degradation product of amyloid precursor protein, results in
progressive neuronal damage, neurofi br illary tangles, numbers of amyloid plaques,
and loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (fi g 10.24). Neuronal loss is selective—
the hippocampus, amygdala, temporal neocortex, and subcortical nuclei are most
vulnerable. Vascular eff ects are also important—95% of AD patients show evidence
of vascular dementia.
Risk factors 1st-degree relative with AD; Down’s syndrome (in which AD is in-
evitable, often <40yrs); homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele (see BOX
‘Genetics and the future’); PICALM, CL1 & CLU variants; vascular risk factors (BP, dia-
betes, dyslipidaemia, homocysteine, AF); physical/cognitive activity; depression;
loneliness (risk ≈ 2; simply living alone is not a risk factor); smoking.
Management See p486 for a general approach to management in dementia.
• Refer to a specialist memory service. • Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (see BOX
‘Pharmacological treatment’). • BP control (in heart failure there is a 2x risk of AD;
extra risk halves with BP control).
Prevention in the context of AD’s time-course: Changes in CSF -amyloid are seen
~25yrs before onset of unequivocal symptoms (USy) and its deposition is detected
15yrs before USy. CSF tau protein and brain atrophy are also detected 15yrs before
USy. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory occur 10yrs before
USy. Global cognitive impairment occurs 5yrs before USy. Prevention will probably
be most eff ective before any of this starts—though there is currently insuffi cient
evidence to recommend any specifi c interventions (BOX ‘Genetics and the future’).
Ultimately, there is no simple relationship between brain structure, neurofi brillary
tangles, and function.
Prognosis Mean survival = 7yrs from USy.
12 ‘Enduring’ doesn’t mean unfl uctuating: cognition comes and goes, allowing poetic insights, as in Iris
Murdoch’s poignant self-diagnosis: ‘I am sailing into the dark’.

Pharmacological treatment of cognitive decline
There is overlap between Lewy body dementia, AD, and Parkinson’s disease (PD),
complicating treatment decisions: L-dopa (p495) can precipitate delusions, and
antipsychotic drugs worsen PD. Rivastigmine may help all three.
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galan-
tamine are all mod estly eff ective in treating AD and are recommended by NICE.6
There is also some evidence for their effi cacy in the dementia of Parkinson’s
disease, and rivastigmine may improve behavioural symptoms in Lewy body
dementia—though none should be used in mild disease and they should be dis-
continued if there is no worthwile eff ect on symptoms. Doses:
• Donepezil: initially 5mg PO, eg doubled after 1 month.
• Riva stigm ine: 1.5mg/12h initially,  to 3–6mg/12h. Patches are also available.
• Galantamine: initially 4mg/12h,  to 8–12mg/12h PO.
The cholinergic eff ects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may exacerbate pep-
tic ulcer disease and heart block. Ask about symptoms and do an ECG fi rst.
Antiglutamatergic treatment: Memantine (an NMDA antagonist, p449) is reason-
ably eff ective in late-stage AD, and is recommended in patients with severe disease
or those with moderate disease in which AChE inhibitors are not tolerated/CI. Dose:
5mg/24h initially,  by 5mg/d weekly to 10mg/12h. SE: hallucinations, confusion,
hypertonia, hypersexuality.
Antipsychotics: Consider in severe, non-cognitive symptoms only (eg psychosis or
extreme agitation). Possible increased risk of stroke/TIA so discuss risks and as-
sess cerebrovascular risk factors. Avoid in mild-to-moderate: Lewy body dementia
(risk of neuroleptic sensitivity reactions), AD, and vascular dementia.
Vitamin supplementation: Trials of dietary and vitamin supplements have been
mixed and disappointing. Perhaps the best evidence exists for vitamin E (2000IU
OD) which may confer a modest benefi t in delaying functional progression in mild
to moderate AD, but with no eff ect on cognitive performance.
Genetics and the future
Possession of the APOE4 allele on chromosome 19 is the leading genetic cause of AD;
homozygosity increases risk of developing the disease 12x. Yet while identifying
this risk could enable a person to make lifestyle changes, there is little else to be
done but anticipate one’s impending cognitive decline (just one of the dilemmas
raised by genetic testing). While the proteins that make up the plaques and neurofi -
brillary tangles seen in AD were identifi ed in the early 1980s, progress has since been
slow. So much so that in 2013, world leaders pledged to have a drug that would halt
dementia within the next 10 years. Now a second-generation tau aggregation in-
hibitor called LMTX just might do the job, having shown success in phase III clinical
trials in patients with mild/moderate AD, with clinical improvement and a slowing
of atrophy on MRI. Perhaps in the imminent future, identifying those at greater risk
of developing AD through genetic testing will have a role.

Epilepsy: diagnosis
Epilepsy is a recurrent tendency to spontaneous, intermittent, abnormal elec trical
activity in part of the brain, manifesting as seizures. Convulsions are the motor signs
of elect rical discharges.
Elements of a seizure Some patients may experience a preceding prodrome last-
ing hours or days in which there may be a change in mood or behaviour. An aura
implies a focal seizure, often, but not necessarily, from the temporal lobe. It may be a
strange feeling in the gut, an experience such as déjà vu or strange smells or fl ashing
lights. Post-ictally there may be headache, confusion, and myalgia; or temporary
weakness after a focal seizure in the motor cortex (Todd’s palsy, p712), or dysphasia
following a focal seizure in the temporal lobe.
Causes ⅔ are idiopathic. Structural: Cortical scarring (eg head injury years be-
fore onset), developmental (eg dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour or corti-
cal dysgenesis), space-occupying lesion, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis (eg after a
febrile convulsion), vascular malformations. Others: Tuberous sclerosis, sarcoido-
sis, SLE, PAN, antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels.
Diagnosis Can be diffi cult due to the heterogenous nature of the disease (there are
>40 diff erent types of epilepsy). NICE estimate 5–30% of people with ‘epilepsy’ have
been wrongly diagnosed.  All patients with a seizure must be referred for specialist
assessment and investigation in <2 wks.
Take a thorough history: Including a detailed description from a witness. Ask spe-
cifi cally about tongue-biting and a slow recovery. If this is a fi rst seizure, enquire
about past funny turns/odd behaviour. Déjà vu and odd episodic feelings of fear
may well be relevant. Are there any triggers (eg alcohol, stress, fl ickering lights/TV)?
Triggered attacks tend to recur.
Establish the type of seizure: See BOX ‘Seizure classifi cation’.7 NB: if a seizure be-
gins with focal features, it is a partial seizure, however rapidly it then generalizes.
Don’t forget non-epileptic attack disorder ( = ‘pseudo’ seizures—psychogenic): this
is not uncommon. (Suspect if seizures have a gradual onset, prolonged duration, and
abrupt termination and are accompanied by closed eyes ± resistance to eye opening,
rapid breathing, fl uctuating motor activity, and episodes of motionless unrespon-
siveness. CNS exam, CT, MRI, and EEG are normal. It may coexist with true epilepsy.)
Rule out provoking causes: Most people would have a seizure given suffi cient prov-
ocation (eg refl ex anoxic seizures in faints) but would not be classed as epileptic: only
3–10% of provoked seizures recur; generally when the provocation is irreversible.
Causes: trauma; stroke; haemorrhage; ICP; alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal;
metabolic disturbance (hypoxia, Na+ , Ca2+, glucose, uraemia, liver disease); in-
fection (eg meningitis, encephalitis); T°; drugs (tricyclics, cocaine). Unprovoked
seizures have a recur rence rate of 30–50%.
Investigations Look for provoking causes. Consider an EEG: it cannot exclude epi-
lepsy and can be falsely +ve, so don’t do one if simple syncope is the likely diagno-
sis. Only do emergency EEGS if non-convulsive status is the problem. Other tests:
MRI (structural lesions); drug levels (if on anti-epileptics: is the patient compli-
ant?); drugs screen; LP (eg if infection suspected).
Counselling After any ‘fi t’, advise about dangers, eg swimming, driving, heights
until the diagnosis is known; then give individualized counselling on employment,
sport, insurance, and conception (OHCS p28). The patient must contact DVLA and
avoid driving until seizure-free for >1yr (p159).

Seizure classifi cation
Focal seizures Originating within networks linked to one hemisphere and often
seen with underlying structural disease. Various subclasses include:
• Without impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as ‘simple’.)
Awareness is unimpaired, with focal motor, sensory (olfactory, visual, etc.), au-
tonomic, or psychic symptoms. No post-ictal symptoms.
• With impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as ‘complex’.)Aware-
ness is impaired—either at seizure onset or following a simple partial aura. Most
commonly arise from the temporal lobe, in which post-ictal confusion is a fea-
ture.
• Evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure: (Previously described as ‘secondary
generalized’.) In ⅔ of patients with partial seizures, the electrical disturbance,
which start s focally, spreads widely, causing a generalized seizure, which is typi-
cally convulsive.
Generalized seizures Originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging
bilaterally distributed networks leading to simultaneous onset of widespread
electrical discharge with no localizing features referable to a single hemisphere.
Important subtypes include:
• Absence seizures: Brief (≤10s) pauses, eg suddenly stops talking in mid-sen-
tence, then carries on where left off . Presents in childhood.
• Tonic–clonic seizures: Loss of consciousness. Limbs stiff en (tonic), then jerk
(clonic). May have one without the other. Post-ictal confusion and drowsiness.
• Myoclonic seizures: Sudden jerk of a limb, face, or trunk. The patient may be
thrown suddenly to the ground, or have a violently disobedient limb: one patient
described it as ‘my fl ying-saucer epilepsy’, as crockery which happened to be in
the hand would take off .
• Atonic (akinetic) seizures: Sudden loss of muscle tone causing a fall, no LOC.
• Infantile spasms: (OHCS p206) Commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis.
NB: the classifi cation of epileptic syndromes is separate to the classifi cation of
seizures, and is based on seizure type, age of onset, EEG fi ndings, and other features
such as family history.
Localizing features of focal seizures
Temporal lobe •Automatisms—complex motor phenomena with impaired aware-
ness, varying from primitive oral (lip smacking, chewing, swallowing) or manual
movements (fumbling, fi ddling, grabbing) , to complex actions. •Dysphasia. •Déjà
vu (when everything seems strangely familiar), or jamais vu (everything seems
strangely unfamiliar). •Emotional disturbance, eg sudden terror, panic, anger, or
elation, and derealization (out-of-body experiences).• Hallucinations of smell, taste,
or sound. •Delus ional behaviour. • Bizarre associations—eg ‘Canned music at Tesco
always makes me cry and then pass out’.
Frontal lobe •Motor features such as posturing or peddling movements of the
legs. •Jacksonian march (a spreading focal motor seizure with retained aware-
ness, often starting with the face or a thumb). •Motor arrest. •Subtle behavioural
disturbances (often diagnosed as psychogenic). •Dysphasia or speech arrest.
•Post-ictal Todd’s palsy (p712).
Parietal lobe •Sensory disturbances—tingling, numbness, pain (rare). •Motor
symptoms (due to spread to the pre-central gyrus).
Occipital lobe •Visual phenomena such as spots, lines, fl ashes.

Epilepsy: management
Living with epilepsy creates many problems: inability to drive and drug side-eff ects
to name a few. Good management of the condition by an integrated specialized team
is therefore of utmost importance.
Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDS) Should only be commenced by a specialist, after con-
fi rmed epilepsy diagnosis, ≥2 seizures (unless risk of recurrence is high, eg struc-
tural brain lesion, focal CNS defi cit, or unequivocal epileptiform EEG), and following
a detailed discussion of treatment options with the patient. AED choice depends on
seizure type and epilepsy syndrome, comorbidities, lifestyle, and patient preference:
• Focal (partial) seizures: 1st line: carbamazepine or lamotrigine. 2nd line: leveti-
racetam, oxcarbazepine, or sodium valproate.13
• Generalized tonic-clonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or lamotrigine. 2nd
line: carbamazepine, clobazam, levetiracetam, or topiramate.
• Absence seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate13 or ethosuximide. 2nd line: lamotrigine.
• Myoclonic seizures: 1st line: sodium valproate.13 2nd line: levetiracetam, or topira-
mate (but SE). Avoid carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine—may worsen seizures.
• Tonic or atonic seizures: Sodium valproate13 or lamotrigine.
Treat with one drug and with one doctor in charge only. Slowly build up doses over
2–3 months (see BOX ‘Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDS)’) until seizures are controlled or
maximum dosage is reached. If ineff ective or not tolerated, switch to the next most
appropriate drug. To switch drugs, introduce the new drug slowly, and only with-
draw the 1st drug once established on the 2nd. Dual (adjunct) therapy is necessary
in <10% of patients—consider if all appropriate drugs have been tried singly at the
optimum dose.
Stopping AEDS: May be done under specialist supervision if the patient has been
seizure-free for >2yrs and after assessing risks and benefi ts for the individual (eg
the need to drive). The dose must be decreased slowly: over at least 2–3 months, or
>6 months for benzodiazepines and barbiturates.
Other interventions Psychological therapies: Eg relaxation, CBT. May benefi t
some, but do not improve seizure frequency so only use as an adjunct to medica-
tion. Surgical intervention: Can be considered if a single epileptogenic focus can
be identifi ed (such as hippocampal sclerosis or a small low-grade tumour). Neuro-
surgical resection off ers up to 70% chance of seizure resolution, but carries the risk
of causing focal neurological defi cits. Alternatives: vagal nerve stimulation, deep
brain stimulation (DBS).
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) More common in uncontrolled
epilepsy, and may be related to nocturnal seizure-associated apnoea or asystole.
Those with epilepsy have 3x mortality. >700 epilepsy-related deaths are recorded/
yr in the UK; up to 17% are SUDEPs. The charity SUDEP Action may be of some help
to families.
13 Sodium valproate is associated with signifi cantly risk of birth and developmental defects in children
born to exposed mothers. Use in women of childbearing potential with caution and only after counselling.

Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDS): typical adult doses and side-eff ects
Carbamazepine: (As slow-release.) Initially 100mg/12h, increase by 200mg/d eve-
ry 2wks up to max 1000mg/12h. SE: leucopenia, diplopia, blurred vision, impaired
balance, drowsin ess, mild generalized erythematous rash, SIADH (rare; see p673).
Lamotrigine: As monotherapy, initially 25mg/d,  by 50mg/d every 2wks up to
100mg/12h (max 250mg/12h). Halve monotherapy dose if on valproate; double if
on carbamazepine or pheny toin (max 350mg/12h). SE: maculopapular rash—occurs
in 10% (but 1/1000 develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necroly-
sis) typically in 1st 8wks, especially if on valproate; warn patients to see a doctor at
once if rash or fl u symptoms develop; Other SES: diplopia, blurred vision, photosen-
sitivity, tremor, agita tion, vomiting, aplastic anaemia.
Levetiracetam: Initially 250mg/24h, increase by 250mg/12h every 2wks up to max
1 . 5g/12h (if eGFR >80). SE: psychiatric side-eff ects are common, eg depression, agi-
tation. Other SES: D&V, dyspepsia, drowsiness, diplopia, blood dyscrasias.
Sodium valproate: Initially 300mg/12h, increase by 100mg/12h every 3d up to max
30mg/kg (or 2 . 5g) daily. SE: teratogenic. Nausea is very common (take with food).
Other SES: liver failure (watch LFT especially during 1st 6 months), pancreatitis, hair
loss (grows back curly), oedema, ataxia, tremor, thrombocytopenia, encephalopa-
thy (hyperammonaemia).
Phenytoin: No longer 1st line due to toxicity (nystagmus, diplopia, tremor, dys-
arthria, ataxia) and SE: intellect, depression, coarse facial features, acne, gum
hyper trophy, polyneuropathy, blood dyscra sias. Blood levels required for dosage.
Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are liver enzyme inducing.
Epilepsy and pregnancy
Epilepsy carries a 5% risk of fetal abnormalities, so good seizure control prior to
conception and during pregnancy is vital. Yet some anti-epileptics are teratogenic:
the patient must be given accurate information and counselling about contracep-
tion, conception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding in order to make informed deci-
sions. In particular:
• Advise women of child-bearing age to take folic acid 5mg/d.
• Strictly avoid sodium valproate and polytherapy prior to conception and during
pregnancy (lamotrigine is preferred but transition needs to be planned).
• Advise that most AEDS except carbamazepine and valproate are present in
breast milk. Lamotrigine is not thought to be harmful to infants.
• Discuss contraceptive methods, bearing in mind that: enzyme-inducing AEDS
make progesterone-only contraception unreliable, and oestrogen-containing
contraceptives lower lamotrigine levels—an increased dose may be needed to
achieve seizure control.

Parkinsonism
This is the extrapyramidal triad of:
1 Tremor. Worse at rest; often ‘pill-rolling’ of thumb over fi ngers
(see p468).
2 Hypertonia. Rigidity + tremor gives ‘cogwheel rigidity’, felt by
the examiner during rapid pronation/supination.
3 Bradykinesia. Slow to initiate movement; actions slow and de-
crease in amplitude with repetition, eg  blink rate, micrographia.
Gait is festinant (shuffl ing, pitched forward, fi g 10.25) with  arm-
swing and freezing at obstacles or doors (due to poor simulta-
neous motor and cognitive function). Expressionless face.
Causes Fig 10.25 ‘Marche à petit pas.’
Parkinson’s disease (PD): Loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra, associated with Lewy bodies in the basal ganglia, brain-
stem, and cortex. Most cases are sporadic, though multiple genetic loci have been
identifi ed in familial cases. Mean age at onset is 60yrs. Prevalence:  with age: 3.5%
at 85–89yrs. Clinical features: The parkinsonian triad, plus non-motor symptoms
such as: autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension, constipation, urinary fre-
quency/urgency, dribbling of saliva), sleep disturbance, and reduced sense of smell.
Neuropsychiatric complications, such as depression, dementia, and psychosis, are
common and debilitating. Diagnosis: Is clinical and based on the core features of
bradykinesia with resting tremor and/or hypertonia; cerebellar disease and fronto-
temporal dementia should be excluded; a clinical response to dopaminergic therapy
is supportive. Signs are invariably worse on one side—if symmetrical look for other
causes. If an alternative cause is suspected then consider MRI to rule out structural
pathology. Functional neuroimaging (DaTscan™, PET) is playing an emerging role.
Treatment: Focuses on symptom control and does not slow disease progression
(see BOX). Non-pharmacological options include deep brain stimulation (DBS, may help
those who are partly dopamine-responsive) and surgical ablation of overactive basal
ganglia circuits (eg subthalamic nuclei).
Parkinson’s plus syndromes Pro gressive supranuclear palsy: (PSP, Steele–Rich-
ardson–Olszewski syndrome.) Early postural instability, vertical gaze palsy ± falls;
rigidity of trunk >limbs; symmetrical onset; speech and swallowing problems; little
tremor. Multiple system atrophy: (MSA; Shy–Drager.) Early autonomic features, eg
impotence/incontinence, postural BP; cerebellar + pyr amidal signs; rigidity > tremor.
Cortico-basal degeneration: (CBD.) Akinetic rigidity involving one limb; cortical
sensory loss (eg astereognosis); apraxia (even autonomous interfering activity by
aff ected limb—the ‘alien limb’ phenomenon). Lewy body dementia: See p486.
Secondary causes Vascular parkinsonism: (2.5–5% of parkinsonism, also called
‘lower limb’ parkinsonism). Eg diabetic/hypertensive patient with postural instabil-
ity and falls (rather than tremor, bradykinesia, and festination). Other secondary
causes: Drugs (neuroleptics, metoclopramide, prochlorp era zine), toxins (manganese),
Wilson’s disease (p285), trauma (dementia pugilistica), encephalitis, neurosyphilis.
Management Requires input of a a multidisc iplinary team (GP, neurologist, nurse
specialist, social worker, carers, physio- and occupational therapist) to boost quality
of life. Assess disability and cognition objectively and regu larly, and monitor mood—
depression is common. Involve palliative care services early on. Postural exercises
and weight lifting may help. Don’t forget the carers (p487): off er respite care.

Pharmacological therapy in Parkinson’s disease
A key decision is when to start supplementation of dopaminergic signalling
with levodopa. Effi cacy of this therapy reduces with time, requiring larger and
more frequent dosing, with worsening SEs and response fl uctuations (such as
unpredictable freezing and pronounced end-of-dose reduced response: ~50% at
6yrs). Starting late may therefore be wise, eg when >70yrs or when PD seriously
interferes with life: discuss pros and cons with the patient. Do not withdraw
medication suddenly—risks acute akinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Be
aware of situations where malabsorption could also have this eff ect (eg abdominal
surgery, gastroenteritis).
Levodopa: Dopamine precursor, given combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibi-
tor in co-beneldopa or co-careldopa. SES: dyskinesia, painful dystonia. Non-motor
SES: psychosis; visual hallucinations, nausea and vomiting (give domperidone).
Modifi ed-release preparations should only be used in late disease.
Dopamine agonists (DAS): Ropinirole and pramipexole monotherapy can delay
starting levodopa in early stages of PD, and allow lower doses of levodopa as PD
progresses. Rotigotine transdermal patches are available as mono- or additive.
SES: drowsiness, nausea, hallucinations, compulsive behaviour (gambling, hyper-
sexuality, p449). Ergot-derived DA-agonists (b romocriptine, pergolide, cabergo-
line) can cause fi brotic reactions, and are not favoured. Amantadine (weak DA) is
used for drug-induced dyskinesias in late PD.
Apomorphine: Potent DA agonist used with continuous SC infusion to even out end-
of-dose eff ects, or as a rescue-pen for sudden ‘off ’ freezing. SE: injection-site ulcers.
Anticholinergics: (Eg benzhexol, orphenadrine.) Cause confusion in the elderly
and have multiple SES—limit to younger patients (but not 1st line).
MAO-B inhibitors: (Eg rasagiline, selegiline.) An alternative to dopamine agonists
in early PD. SEs include postural hypotension and atrial fi brillation.
COMT inhibitors: (Eg entacapone, tolcapone.) May help motor complications in
late disease. Lessen the ‘off ’ time in those with end-of-dose wearing off . Tolcapone
has better effi cacy, but may cause severe hepatic complications and requires close
monitoring of LFT.

Multiple sclerosis (MS)
Infl ammatory plaques of demyelination in the CNS disseminated in space and time;
ie occuring at multiple sites, with ≥30d in between attacks. Demyelination heals
poorly, eventually causing axonal loss; >80% of patients develop progressive disabil-
ity. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown; it is most likely a combination
of genetic and environmental factors. There is >30% concordance in identical twins,
and unusual geographical distribution, with increasing incidence with latitude in
some parts of the world (NB: adult migrants take their risk with them; children ac-
quire the risk of where they settle)—leading to hypotheses of the roles of vitamin D
and infection. Mean age of onset is 30yrs. : ≥3:1.
Presentation Usually monosymptomatic: ~20% present with unilateral optic neuri-
tis (pain on eye movement and rapid central vision). Corticospinal tract and bladder
involvement are also common, and symptoms may worsen with heat (eg hot bath or
exercise). Other symptoms/signs see table 10.8.
Diagnosis This is clinical, made by a consultant neurologist using established crite-
ria (eg McDonald, see table 10.9) and after alternative diagnoses have been excluded.
Early diagnosis and treatment reduce relapse rates and disability so refer to neu-
rology as soon as MS is suspected.
Tests Depending on presenting symptoms, some patients may need extra support-
ing information to make a diagnosis (as per the McDonald criteria). MRI: Sensi-
tive but not sp e cifi c for plaque detection. It may also exclude other causes, eg cord
compression. CSF: Oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis that are not present
in serum suggest CNS infl am mation. Delayed visual, auditory, and somatosensory
evoked potentials.
Progression Most patients follow a relapsing-remitting course, with initial recov-
ery in between relapses. With time, remission becomes incomplete, so disability
accumulates (secondary progression). 10% of patients display steadily progressive
disability in the absence of relapses (primary progressive MS), while a minority of pa-
tients experience no progressive disablement at all. Poor prognostic signs: Older ;
motor signs at onset; many early relapses; many MRI lesions; axonal loss. Pregnancy:
Does not alter the rate of progression: relapses may reduce during pregnancy and
increase 3–6 months afterwards, but return to their previous rate thereafter.
Management As with all neurological conditions, requires the coordinated care of a
multidis ciplinary team and full involvement of the patient in all decisions.8
Lifestyle advice: Regular exercise, stopping smoking and avoiding stress may help.
Disease-modifying drugs: Dimethyl fumarate is an option for mild/moderate re-
lapsing-remitting MS. The monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab (acts against T cells)
and natalizumab (acts against VLA-4 receptors that allow immune cells to cross the
blood–brain barrier) are also approved for relapsing-remitting disease. Interferon
beta and glatiramer are not recommended by NICE on the balance of clinical and
cost-eff ectiveness. Azathioprine is not recommended due to its SE profi le.
Treating relapses: Methylprednisolone, eg 0.5–1g/24h IV/PO for 3–5d shortens acute
relapses; use sparingly ( twice/yr; steroid SE, p377). It doesn’t alter overall prognosis.
Symptom control: Spasticity: off er baclofen or gabapentin. Tizanidine or dant-
rolene are 2nd line; if these fail consider benzodiazepines. Tremor: botulinum toxin
type A injections improve arm tremor and functioning . Urgency/frequency: if post-
micturition residual urine >100mL, teach intermittent self-catheterization; if <100mL,
try tolterodine. Fatigue: amantadine, CBT, and exercise may help.

A careful history may reveal past episodes, eg brief unexplained visual loss, and
detailed examination may show more than 1 lesion.
Attacks must last >1h, with >30d between attacks.
Six MS eponyms
Devic’s syndrome: (=Neuromyelitis optica, NMO.) MS variant with transverse my-
elitis, (loss of motor, sensory, autonomic, refl ex, and sphincter function below the
level of a lesion), optic atrophy, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (p698).
Lhermitte’s sign: Neck fl exion causes ‘electric shocks’ in trunk/limbs. (Also +ve in
cervical spondylosis, cord tumours and B12.)
Uhthoff’s phenomenon: Worsening of symptoms with heat, eg in bath.
Charles Bonnet syndrome: (Rare.) Acuity/temporary blindness ± complex visual
hallucinations of faces, as well as animals, plants, and trees.
Pulfrich effect: Unequal eye latencies, causing disorie ntation in traffi c as straight
trajectories seem curved and distances are misjudged on looking sideways.

Space-occupying lesions (SOL)
Signs •ICP: (See p830.) Headache worse on waking, lying down, bending forward, or
with coughing (p456); vomiting; papilloedema (only in 50% of tumours); GCS.
• Seizures: Seen in ≤50%. Exclude SOL in all adult-onset seizures, especially if focal, or
with a localizing aura or post-ictal weakness (Todd’s palsy, p712).
• Evolving focal neurology: See BOX for localizing signs. ICP causes false localizing
signs: VIth nerve palsy is commonest (p70) due to its long intracranial course.
• Subtle personality change: Irritability, lack of application to tasks, lack of initia-
tive, socially inappropriate behaviour.
Causes Tumour (primary or metastatic, later in topic), aneurysm, abscess (25%
multiple); chronic subdural haematoma, granuloma (p197, eg tuberculoma), cyst (eg
cysticercosis). Tumours: 30% are metastatic (eg breast, lung, melanoma). Prima-
ries: astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, oligo dendro glioma, ependymoma. Also
meningioma, primary CNS lymphoma (eg as non-infectious manifestation of HIV), and
cerebellar haemangiob lastoma.
Diff erentials Stroke, head injury, venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis, MS, encephali-
tis, post-ictal, metabolic, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
Tests CT ± MRI (good for posterior fossa masses). Consider biopsy. Avoid LP before
imaging (risks coning, ie cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum).
Tumour management Benign: Remove if possible but some may be inaccessi-
ble. Malignant: Excision of gliomas is hard as resection margins are rarely clear,
but surgery does give a tissue diagnosis, it debulks pre-radiotherapy, and makes a
cavity for inserting carmustine wafers (delivers local chemotherapy). If a tumour
is inaccessible but causing hydrocephalus, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt can help.
Chemo-radiotherapy is used post-op for gliomas or metastases, and as sole therapy
if surgery is impossible. Oligodendroglioma with 1p/19q deletions is especially sensi-
tive. In glioblastoma, temozolomide (alkylating agent) survival. Seizure prophylaxis
(eg phenyt oin) is important, but often fails. Treat headache (eg codeine 60mg/4h PO).
Cerebral oedema: Dexamethasone 4mg/8h PO; mannitol if ICP acutely (p831). Plan
meticulous palliative treatment (p534).
Prognosis Poor but improving (<50% survival at 5yrs) for CNS primaries; 40% 20yr
survival for cerebellar haemangiob lastoma; benign tumours are curable by excision.
Third-ventricle colloid cysts These congenital cysts declare themselves in adult
life with amnesia,headache(often positional),obtundation(blunted consciousness),
incontinence, dim vision, bilateral paraesthesiae, weak legs, and drop attacks.
: Excision or ventriculo-peritoneal shunting.
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
Think of this in those presenting as if with a mass (headache, ICP, and papilloede-
ma)—when none is found. Most commonly seen in obese females in 3rd decade, who
present with narrowed visual fi elds, blurred vision ± diplopia, VIth nerve palsy, and
an enlarged blind spot, if papilloedema is present (it usually is). Consciousness and
cognition are preserved.
Associations Endocrine abnormalities (Cushing’s syndrome, hypoparathyroidism,
TSH), SLE, CKD, IDA, PRV, drugs (tetracycline, steroids, nitrofurantoin, and oral con-
traceptives).
Management Weight loss, acetazolamide or topiramate, loop diuretics, and predni-
solone (start at ~40mg/24h PO; more SE than diuretics). Consider optic nerve sheath
fenestration or lumbar–peritoneal shunt if drugs fail and visual loss worsens.
Prognosis Often self-limiting. Permanent signifi cant visual loss in 10%.

ataxia is worse on eye closure, blame the dorsal columns); nystagmus; intention
tremor; slurred speech (dysarthria); hypotonia.

Bell’s palsy (idiopathic facial nerve palsy)
Aff ects 15–40/100 000/yr,  ≈ . Risk  in pregnancy (≈3) and in diabetes (≈5).
Clinical features Abrupt onset (eg overnight or after a nap) with complete unilat-
eral facial weakness at 24–72h; ipsilateral numbness or pain around the ear; taste
(ageusia); hypers ens itivity to sounds (from stapedius palsy). On examination the pa-
tients will be unable to wrinkle their forehead, confi rming LMN pathology (see p70),
or whistle (tests buccinator). Other symptoms of VIIth palsy (from any cause):
• Unilateral sagging of the mouth.• Drooling of saliva. • Food trapped between gum
and cheek. • Speech diffi culty. • Failure of eye closure may cause a watery or dry eye,
ectropion (sagging and turning-out of the lower lid), injury from foreign bodies, or
conjunctivitis.
Other causes of VIIth palsy Account for ~30% of facial palsies. Think of these
if: rashes, bilateral symptoms, UMN signs, other cranial nerve involvement, or limb
weakness. Infective: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (BOX), Lyme disease, meningitis, TB,
viruses (HIV, polio). Brainstem lesions: Stroke, tumour, MS. Cerebellopontine angle
tumours: Acoustic neuroma, meningioma. Systemic disease: DM, sarcoidosis, Guil-
lain–Barré. Local disease: Orofacial granulomatosis, parotid tumours, otitis media or
cholesteatoma, skull base trauma.
Lyme disease, Guillain–Barré, sarcoid, and trauma often cause bilateral weakness.
Tests Rule out the other causes: Blood: ESR; glucose;  Borrelia antibodies in Lyme
disease,  VZV antibodies in Ramsay Hunt syndrome (BOX). CT/MRI: Space-occupying
lesions; stroke; MS; CSF: (Rarely done) for infections.
Prognosis Incomplete paralysis without axonal degen eration usually recovers
completely within a few weeks. Of those with complete paralysis ~80% make a full
spontaneous recovery, but ~15% have axonal degeneration (~50% in pregnancy) in
which case recovery is delayed, starting after ~3 months, and may be comp licated
by aberrant reconnect ions: synkinesis, eg eye blinking causes synchronous upturn-
ing of the mouth; misconnection of parasympathetic fi bres (red in fi g 10.26) can
produce crocodile tears (gusto–lacrimal refl ex) when eating stimu lates unilateral
lacrimation, not salivation.
Management Drugs: If given within 72h of onset, prednisolone (eg 60mg/d PO for
5d, tailing by 10mg/d) speeds recovery, with 95% making a full recovery. Antivirals
(eg aciclovir) don’t help; although some cases are thought to be associated with
HSV–1, no one has shown actively replicating virus. There are little data to guide treat-
ment if presenting after 72h of onset, but corticos teroids are widely used (though SE,
p377). No advice on the use of steroids is universally agreed in pregnancy. Protect
the eye: • Dark glasses and artifi cial tears (eg hyprom ellose) if evidence of drying.
• Encourage regular eyelid closure by pulling down the lid by hand. • Use tape to
close the eyes at night. Surgery: Consider if eye closure remains a long-term prob-
lem (lagophthalmos) or ectropion is severe.

sublingual glands (via the chorda tympani nerve). The sensory part contains the fi bres of taste
for the anterior ⅔ of the tongue and a few somatic sensory fi bres from the middle ear region.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome
Latent varicella zoster virus reactivating in the geniculate ganglion of the VIIth
cranial nerve. Symptoms: Painful vesicular rash on the auditory canal ± on drum,
pinna, tongue palate, or iris (hyphaema, ie blood under the cornea) with ipsilat-
eral facial palsy, loss of taste, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, dry mouth and eyes. The
rash may be subtle or even absent (‘herpes sine herpete’=herpes without herpes).
Incidence: ~5/100 000 (higher if >60yrs). Diagnosis: Clinical, as antiviral treatment
is thought to be most eff ective within the 1st 72h, while the virus is replicating.
: Antivirals (eg aciclovir 800mg PO 5 ≈ daily for 7d) + prednisolone, as for Bell’s
palsy. Prognosis: If treated within 72h, ~75% recover well; if not, ~ ⅓ make a good
recovery, ⅓ a reasonable recovery, and ⅓ a poor recovery.

Mononeuropathies
Lesions of individual peripheral or cranial nerves. Causes are usually local, such as
trauma, or entrapment (eg tumour), except for carpal tunnel syndrome (see BOX ‘Car-
pal tunnel syndrome’).
Median nerve C6–T1 The median nerve is the nerve of precision grip—muscles in-
volved are easier to remember if you use your ‘LOAF’ (two lumbricals, opponens pol-
licis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis). The clinical features depend
on the location of the lesion: At the wrist: (Eg see BOX ‘Carpal tunnel syndrome’.)
Weakness of abductor pollicis brevis and sensory loss over the radial 3½ fi ngers and
palm. Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: (Eg trauma.) Weakness of fl exion of the
distal phalanx of the thumb and index fi nger. Proximal lesions: (Eg compression at
the elbow.) May show combined defects.
Ulnar nerve C7–T1 Vulnerable to elbow trauma. Signs: Weakness/wasting of
medial (ulnar side) wrist fl exors, interossei (cannot cross the fi nge rs in the good
luck sign), and medial two lumbricals (claw hand, more marked in wrist lesions with
digitorum profundus intact); hypothenar emine nce wasting, weak 5th digit abduction,
and 4th and 5th DIP joint fl exion; sensory loss over medial 1½ fi ngers and ulnar side of
the hand. Treatment: see BOX ’Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments’.
Radial nerve C5–T1 This nerve opens the fi st. It may be damaged by compression
against the humerus. Signs: Test for wrist and fi nger drop with elbow fl exed and
arm pronated; sensory loss is variable—the dorsal aspect of the root of the thumb
(the anatomical snuff box) is most reliably aff ected. Muscles involved: (‘BEAST’)
brachioradialis; extensors; abductor pollicis longus; supinator; triceps.
Brachial plexus Pain/paraesthesiae and weakness in the aff ected arm in a vari-
able distribution. Causes: Trauma, radiotherapy (eg for breast carcinoma), pro-
longed wearing of a heavy rucksack, cervical rib, thoracic outlet compression (also
aff ects vasculature), or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage–Turner syndrome: uni-
lateral sudden, severe pain, followed over hours by profound weakness, resolv-
ing completely over days. May rarely involve the phrenic or lower cranial nerves.)
Phrenic nerve C3–5 C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea
with a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR. Causes: Lung cancer, TB, paraneopla stic syn-
dromes, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma, thoracic surgery, infec-
tions (HZV, HIV, Lyme disease), muscular dystrophy.
Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh L2–L3 Meralgia paraesthetica is antero-
lateral burning thigh pain from entrapment under the inguinal ligament.
Sciatic nerve L4–S3 Damaged by pelvic tumours or fractures to pelvis or femur.
Lesions aff ect the hamstrings and all muscles below the knee (foot drop), with
loss of sensation below the knee laterally.
Common peroneal nerve L4–S1 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee.
Often damaged as it winds round the fi bular head (trauma, sitting cross-legged).
Signs: Foot drop, weak ankle dorsifl exion/eversion, sensory loss over dorsal foot.
Tibial nerve L4–S3 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Lesions lead
to an inability to stand on tiptoe (plantarfl exion), invert the foot, or fl ex the toes,
with sensory loss over the sole.
Mononeuritis multiplex Describes the involvement of two or more peripheral
nerves. Causes tend to be systemic: DM, connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid,
SLE), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly Wegener’s granuloma-
tosis, PAN), and more rarely sarcoidosis, amy loid, leprosy. Electrom yography (EMG)
helps defi ne the anatomic site of lesions.

Carpal tunnel syndrome: the commonest mononeuropathy
The median nerve and nine tendons compete for space within the wrist. Compres-
sion is common, especially in women who have narrower wrists but similar-sized
tendons to men.
Clinical features: Aching pain in the hand and arm (especially at night), and par-
aesthesiae in thumb, index, and middle fi ngers: relieved by dangling the hand over
the edge of the bed and shaking it (remember ‘wake and shake’). There may be
sensory loss and weakness of abductor pollicis brevis ± wasting of the thenar emi-
nence. Light touch, 2-point discrimination, and sweating may be impaired.
Causes: Anything causing swelling or compression of the tunnel: myxoedema;
prolonged fl exion (eg in a Colles’ splint); acromegaly; myeloma; local tumours
(lipomas, ganglia); rheumatoid arthritis; amyloidosis; pregnancy; sarcoidosis.
Tests: Neurophysiology helps by confi rming the lesion’s site and severity (and like-
lihood of improvement after surgery). Maximal wrist fl exion for 1 min (Phalen’s
test) may elicit symptoms, and tapping over the nerve at the wrist can induce
tingling (Tinel’s test) but both are rather non-specifi c.
Treatment: Splinting, local steroid injection ± decompr ession surgery.
NB: There is also tarsal tunnel syndrome: unilateral burning sole pain following
tibial nerve compression.
Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments
The ulnar nerve asks for trouble in at least fi ve places at the elbow, starting
proximally at the arcade of Struthers (a musculofascial band ~8cm proximal to
the medial epicondyle), and ending distally where it exits the fl exor carpi ulnaris
muscle in the forearm. Most often, compression occurs at the epicondylar groove
or at the point where the nerve passes between the two heads of fl exor carpi ul-
naris (true cubital tunnel syndrome). Trauma can easily damage the nerve against
its bony confi nes (the medial condyle of the humerus—the ‘funny bone’). Normally,
stretch and compression forces on the ulnar nerve at the elbow are moderated
by its ability to glide in its groove. When normal excursion is restricted, irritation
ensues. This may cause a vicious cycle of perineural scarring, consequent loss of
excursion, and progressive symptoms—without antecedent trauma. Compressive
ulnar neuropathies at the wrist (Guyon’s canal—between the pisiform and hamate
bones) are less common, but they can also result in disability.
Treatment centres on rest and avoiding pressure on the nerve, but if symp-
toms conti nue, night-time soft elbow splinting (to prevent fl exion >60°) is
warranted. A splint for the hand may help prevent permanent clawing of
the fi ngers. For chronic neuropathy associated with weakness, or if splint-
ing fails, a variety of surgical procedures have been tried. For moderately se-
vere neuropathies, decompressions in situ may help, but often fail. Medial
epicondylectomies are eff ective in 50% (but many will recur). Subcutaneous
nerve re-routing (transposition) may be tried.

Polyneuropathies
Motor and/or sensory disorder of multiple periphe ral or cranial nerves: usually sym-
metrical, widespread, and often worse distally (‘glove and stocking’ distribution).
They can be classifi ed by: chronicity, function (sensory, motor, autonomic, mixed),
or pathology (demyelination, axonal degeneration, or both). For example, Guillain–
Barré syndrome (p702) is an acute, predominantly motor, demyelinating neurop athy,
whereas chronic alcohol abuse leads to a chronic, initially sensory then mixed, axonal
neuropathy.
Diagnosis The history is vital: be clear about the time course, the precise nature of
the symptoms, and any preceding or associated events (eg D&V before Guillain–Barré
syndrome; weight in cancer; arthralgia from a connective tissue disease). Ask about
travel, alcohol and drug use, sexual infections, and family history. If there is palpable
nerve thickening think of leprosy or Charcot–Marie–Tooth. Examine other systems
for clues to the cause, eg alcoholic liver disease.
Tests FBC, ESR, glucose, U&E, LFT, TSH, B12, electrophoresis, ANA, ANCA, CXR, urinalysis,
consider LP ± specifi c genetic tests for inherited neuropathies, lead level, antigan-
glioside antibodies. Nerve conduction studies distinguish demyelinating from ax-
onal causes.
Sensory neuropathy: (Eg DM, CKD, leprosy.) Numbness; pins and needles, paraesthe-
siae; aff ects ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. Diffi culty handling small objects such
as buttons. Signs of trauma (eg fi nger burns) or joint deformation may indicate
sensory loss. Diabetic and alcoholic neuropathies are typically painful.
Motor neuropathy: (Eg Guillain–Barré syndrome, lead poisoning, Charcot–Marie–
Tooth syndrome.) Often progressive (may be rapid); weak or clumsy hands; diffi -
culty in walking (falls, stumbling); diffi culty in breathing (vital capacity). Signs:
LMN lesion: wasting and weakness most marked in the distal muscles of hands and
feet (foot or wrist drop). Refl exes are reduced or absent.
Cranial nerves: Swallowing/speaking diffi culty; diplopia.
Autonomic system: See BOX.
Management Treat the cause (table 10.10). Involve physio and OT. Foot care and
shoe choice are important in sensory neuropathies to minimize trauma. Splint-
ing joints helps prevent contractures in prolonged paralysis. In Guillain–Barré and
chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP: autoimmune
demyelination of peripheral nerves), IV immunoglobulin helps. For vasculitic caus-
es, steroids/immuno suppressants may help. Treat neuropathic pain with amitrip-
tyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin.

Sympathetic and parasympathetic neuropathies may be isolated or part of a
generalized sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.
Causes DM, amyloidosis, Guillain–Barré and Sjögren’s syndromes, HIV, leprosy,
SLE, toxic, genetic (eg porphyria), or paraneoplastic, eg paraneoplastic e ncephalo-
myelo neuropathies and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS, p512).
Signs Sympathetic: Postural hypotension, sweating, ejaculatory failure,
Horner’s syndrome (p702). Parasympathetic: Constipation, nocturnal dia rrhoea,
urine retention, erectile dysf unction, Holmes–Adie pupil (p72).
Autonomic function tests
• BP: Postural drop of 20/10mmHg is abnormal.
• ECG: A variation of <10bpm with respiration is abnormal (check R-R interval).
•Cystometry: Bladder pressure studies.
• Pupils: Instil 0.1% adrenaline (dilates if post-ganglionic sympathetic denerva-
tion, not if normal); 2.5% cocaine (dilates if normal; not if sympathetic denerva-
tion); 2.5% methacholine (constricts if parasympathetic lesion)—rarely used.
• Paraneoplastic antibodies: Anti-HU, anti-YO, anti-RI, anti-amphiphysin, anti-
CV2, anti-MA2. Other Ab: Antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody pres-
ence shows that the cause may be autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.
Primary autonomic failure Occurs alone (autoimmune autonomic ganglion-
opathy), as part of multisystem atrophy (MSA, p494), or with Parkinson’s dis-
ease, typically in a middle-aged/elderly man. Onset: insidious; symptoms as
listed previously.

Motor neuron disease (MND)
MND is a cluster of neurodegenerative diseases aff ecting 6/100 000 (: ≈ 3 : 2), char-
acterized by selective loss of neurons in motor cortex, cranial nerve nuclei, and an-
terior horn cells. Upper and lower motor neurons can be aff ected but there is no
sensory loss or sphincter disturbance, thus distinguishing MND from MS and poly-
neuropathies. MND never aff ects eye movements, distinguishing it from myasthenia
(p512). There are four clinical patterns:
1 ALS/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (Archetypal MND; up to 80%.) Loss of motor
neurons in motor cortex and the anterior horn of the cord, so combined UMN + LMN
signs (p446). Worse prognosis if: bulbar onset, age; FVC.
2 Progressive bulbar palsy. (10–20%.) Only aff ects cranial nerves IX–XII. See BOX
‘Bulbar and corticobulbar (‘pseudobulbar’) palsy’.
3 Progressive muscular atrophy. (<10%.) Anterior horn cell lesion, so LMN signs
only. Aff ects distal muscle groups before proximal. Better prognosis than ALS.
4 Primary lateral sclerosis. (Rare.) Loss of Betz cells in motor cortex: mainly UMN
signs, marked spastic leg weakness and pseudobulbar palsy. No cognitive decline.
Presentation Think of MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stum-
bling spastic gait, foot-drop ± proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don’t
turn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is hard), or aspiration pneumonia. Look
for UMN signs: spasticity, brisk refl exes, plantars; and LMN signs: wasting, fascic-
ulation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh. Is speech or swallowing aff ected (bulbar
signs)? Fasciculation is not enough to diagnose an LMN lesion: look for weakness too.
Frontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25% (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’).
Diagnostic criteria (See BOX ‘Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS’). There
is no diagnostic test. Brain/cord MRI helps exclude structural causes, LP helps exclude
infl ammatory ones, and neurophysiology can detect subclinical denervation and help
exclude mimicking motor neuropathies.14
Prognosis Poor, <3yrs post onset in half of patients.
Management Adopt a multidisciplinary approach: neurologist, palliative nurse,
hosp ice, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services—all orchestrated by
the GP. Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release and NMDA receptor antagonist,
is the only medication shown to improve survival. Mulitple other drugs that have
shown promise in animal models have failed to prove benefi t in clinical trials, includ-
ing neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic agents, antioxidants, and immunomodu-
latory drugs. For supportive/symptomatic treatment: Excess saliva: Advise on
positioning, oral care, and suctioning. Try an antimuscarinic (eg propantheline) or
glycopyrronium bromide (can be given SC). Botulinum toxin A may help. Dysphagia:
Blend food. Gastrostomy is an option—discuss early on. Spasticity: Exercise, orthot-
ics. See MS for drugs (p496). Communication diffi culty: Provide ‘augmentative and
alternative’ communication equipment. End-of-life care: Involve palliative care
team from diagnosis (p532). Consider opioids to relieve breathlessness and discuss
non-invasive ventilation (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’).
14 If no UMN signs and distal arm muscles are aff ected in the distribution of individual nerves, suspect
multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (diagnose on nerve conduction studies; : IV Ig).
Gyn aeco mastia, atrophic testes ± infertility suggests Kennedy syndrome (bulbospinal muscular atrophy).

Bulbar and corticobulbar (‘pseudobulbar’) palsy
Bulbar palsy denotes diseases of the nuclei of cranial nerves IX–XII in the medulla.
Signs: An LMN lesion of the tongue and muscles of talking and swallowing: fl accid,
fasciculating tongue (like a sack of worms); jaw jerk is normal or absent, speech
is quiet, hoarse, or nasal. Causes: MND, Guillain–Barré, polio, myasthenia gravis,
syringo bulbia (p516), brainstem tumours, central pontine myelinolysis (p672).
Corticobulbar palsy UMN lesion of muscles of swallowing and talking due to
bilateral lesions above the mid-pons, eg corticobulbar tracts (MS, MND, stroke, cen-
tral pontine myelinolysis). It is commoner than bulbar palsy. Signs: Slow tongue
movements, with slow deliberate speech; jaw jerk; pharyngeal and palatal re-
fl exes; pseudobulbar aff ect (PBA)—weeping unprovoked by sorrow or mood-incon-
gruent giggling (emotional incontinence without mood change is also seen in MS,
Wilson’s, and Parkinson’s disease, dementia, nitrous oxide use, and head injury). In
some countries, dextromethorphan + quinidine is licensed for PBA.
Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS
Defi nite Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 3 regions.
Probable Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 2 regions.
Probable with lab support Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region, or
upper motor neuron signs in ≥1 region + EMG shows acute denervation in ≥2 limbs.
Possible Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 1 region.
Suspected Upper or lower motor neuron signs only—in 1 or more regions.
Dignity and Dignitas
ALS is closely linked with frontotemporal dementia (FTD, p486) by increasing
clinical, genetic, and molecular evidence (nucleotide repeat expansions in gene
C9orf72 have been described in familial and sporadic ALS and in FTD). However, pa-
tients with MND often have no cognitive impairment in the early stages of the dis-
ease, and witness their inorexable physical decline with terrifi ed awareness. For
this reason it is imperative to plan for the future early: discuss their wishes for
end-of-life care and in the eventuality of respiratory decline before it is too late
for wishes to be communicated. These discussions are crucial but not binding: the
patient can change their mind at any point, and also refuse any life-prolonging
treatment, knowing the consequence is death. However, in most countries, in-
cluding the UK, we cannot traverse that line that lies between management of
a supported death following withdrawal of life-prolonging (or death-prolonging)
interventions, and acting with the intention of causing death. Court battles en-
sue, with requests for assisted suicide that may frustrate and challenge ethicists,
physicians, politicians, and the judiciary, but above all, patients and their families.
Faced with such confl icting passions, perhaps our role is to be clear that we stand
beside our patients, come what may.

Cervical spondylosis
Degeneration of the cervical spine with age is inevitable, and has a wide clinical spec-
trum, ranging from asymptomatic to progressive spastic quadriparesis and sensory
loss due to compression of the cord (myelopathy).
Pathogenesis Degeneration of the annulus fi brosus (the tough coating of the in-
tervertebral discs), combined with osteophyte formation on the adjacent vertebra
leads to narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina (fi gs 10.27, 10.28).
As the neck fl exes and extends, the cord is dragged over these protruding bony spurs
anteriorly and indented by a thickened ligamentum fl avum posteriorly.
Presenting complaint Neck stiff ness (but common in anyone >50yrs old), crepitus
on moving neck, stabbing or dull arm pain (brachialgia), forearm/wrist pain.
Signs Limited, painful neck movement ± crepitus (examine gently). Neck fl exion may
produce tingling down the spine (Lhermitte’s sign, p497). NB: this does not distinguish
between cord or roots (or both) involvement.
Root compression (radiculopathy): Pain/‘electrical’ sensations in arms or fi ngers
at the level of the compression (table 10.11), with numbness, dull refl exes, LMN
weakness, and eventual wasting of muscles innervated by the aff ected root. NB:
UMN signs below level of the aff ected root suggests cord compression.
Features of cord compression: Progressive symptoms (eg weak, clumsy hands;
gait disturbance); UMN leg signs (spastic weakness, plantars); LMN arm signs (wast-
ing, hyporefl exia); incontinence, hesitancy, and urgency are late features.
Which nerve root is aff ected? See table 10.11.
 MS; nerve root neurofi broma; subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12);
compression by bone or cord tumours.
Management Urgent MRI and specialist referral guided by red fl ag symptoms
(see p542). Bear in mind that although these are stressed in virtually every set of
guidelines, no two lists are alike and review of evidence suggests that the accuracy
of these features is low. Don’t make referral decisions based upon the presence
or absence of a single feature, but use these to inform your judgement. Otherwise:
give analgesia (as per WHO ladder) and encourage gentle activity. Cervical collars
may give respite during brief periods of increased pain, but restrict mobility, so
may prolong symptoms: avoid where possible. If no improvement in 4–6 weeks
then MRI and consider neurosurgical referral for: interlaminar cervical epidural
injections, transforaminal injections or surgical decompression (via anterior ap-
proach, eg discectomy or posterior approach, eg laminectomy—fi g 10.29, or
laminoplasty—fi g 10.30). There is no consensus or high-quality evidence to guide
selection of approach or of patients, though interventions may be best reserved for
those with progressive deterioration, myelopathy causing disabling neurologic defi -
cits, or those at risk for deterioration (eg severe spinal cord compression on MRI).

Myopathy
Primary disorder of muscle with gradual-onset symmetrical weakness; it may be
confused clinically with neuropathy. In favour of myopathy: •Gradual onset of sym-
metric proximal weakness—diffi culty combing hair and climbing stairs (NB: weakness
is also distal in myotonic dystrophy). •Specifi c muscle groups aff ected (ie selective
weakness on fi rst presentation). •Preserved tendon refl exes. •No paraesthesiae or
bladder problems. •No fasciculation (suggests anterior horn cell or root disease).
Rapid onset suggests a toxic, drug, or metabolic myopathy (or a neuropathy).
Excess fatigability (weakness with exercise) suggests myasthenia (p512). Sponta-
neous pain at rest and local tenderness occurs in infl ammatory myopathies. Pain on
exercise suggests ischaemia or metabolic myopathy (eg McArdle’s disease). Oddly
fi rm muscles (due to infi ltrati ons with fat or connective tissue) suggest pseudo-
hyper trop hic muscular dystrophi es (eg Duchenne’s).
Tests ESR, CK, AST, and LDH may be raised. Do EMG and tests relevant to systemic
causes (eg TSH, p216). Muscle biopsy and genetic testing may help reach a diagnosis.
Muscular dystrophies A group of genetic diseases (see table 10.12) with progres-
sive degeneration and weakness of specifi c muscle groups. The primary abnormal-
ity may be in the muscle membrane. There may be unusually fi rm muscles due to
infi ltrati on by fat or connective tissue, and marked variation in size of individual
muscle fi bres on histology. • Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy: The commonest
(3/1000 male live births). Presents at ~4yrs old with clumsy walking, then diffi -
culty in standing, and respiratory failure. Pseudohypertrophy is seen, especially in
the calves. Serum creatine kinase  >40-fold. There is no specifi c treatment. Some
survive beyond 20yrs. Home ventilation improves prognosis. Genetic counselling is
vital. • Becker’s muscular dystrophy: (~0.3/1000  births.) Presents similarly to
Duchenne’s but with milder symptoms, at a later age, and with a better prognosis.
• Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrop hy: (FSHD, Landouzy–Dejerine.) Almost as
common as Duchenne’s. Onset is ~12–14yrs old, with inability to puff out the cheeks
and diffi culty raising the arms above the head. Signs: weakness of face (‘ironed out’
expression), shoulders, and upper arms (often asymmetric with deltoids spared),
foot-drop, scapular winging (fi g 10.31) , scoliosis, anterior axillary folds, and horizon-
tal clavicles. 20% need a wheelchair by 40yrs.
Myotonic disorders Cause tonic muscle spasm (myotonia), and demonstrate long
chains of central nuclei within muscle fi bres on histology. The commonest is myo-
tonic dystrophy which is, in fact, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with two
major forms (DM1 and DM2—see table 10.12), both showing abnormal trinucleotide
repeat expansions in regulatory (non-coding) genetic regions. DM1 is the commoner,
more severe, and typically presents between 20–40 yrs old with distal weakness
(hand/foot drop), weak sternomastoids, and myotonia. Facial weakness and muscle
wasting give a long, haggard appearance. Also: cataracts, male frontal baldness,
diabetes, testis/ovary atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and cognition. Most DM1 patients
die in late middle age of respiratory or cardiac complications. Mexiletine may help
with disabling myotonia. Genetic counselling is important.
Infl ammatory myopathies There may be spontaneous muscle pain at rest
and local tenderness on palpation. Inclusion body myositis is the chief example
if aged >50yrs. Weakness starts with quadriceps, fi nger fl exors, or pharyngeal
muscles. Ventral extremity muscle groups are more aff ected than dorsal or girdle
groups. Response to therapy is poor and patients typically progress over a decade
to require assistance with activites of daily living. Histology shows ringed vacuoles
+ intranuclear inclusions. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis, see p552.
Metabolic myopathies Eg McArdle’s disease (glycogen storage disorder). Pre-
sents with muscle pain and weakness after exercise.
Acquired myopathies of late onset Often part of systemic disease—eg hyper-
thyroidism, malignancy, Cushing’s, hypo- and hypercalcaemia.
Drug causes Alcohol; statins; steroids; chloroquine; zidovudine; vincristine; cocaine.

Myasthenia gravis (MG)
MG is an autoimmune disease mediated by antibodies to nicotinic acetylcholine recep-
tors (AChR) on the post-synaptic side of the neuromuscular junction (fi g 10.32). Both B
and T cells are implicated.
Presentation Slowly increasing or relapsing muscular fatigue. Muscle groups af-
fected, in order: extra ocular; bulbar (swallowing, chewi ng); face; neck; limb girdle;
trunk. Signs: Ptosis, diplopia, myasthenic snarl on smiling, ‘peek sign’ of orbicularis
fatigability (eyelids begin to separate after manual opposition to sustained closure).
On counting to 50, the voice fades (dysphonia is a rare presentation). Tendon refl exes
are normal. Symptoms exacerbated by: Pregnancy, K+, infection, over-treatment,
change of climate, emotion, exercise, gentamicin, opiates, tetracycline, quinine,
-blockers.
Diff erentials Polymyositis/other myopathies (p510); SLE; Takayasu’s arteritis (fati-
gability of the extremities); botulism (see BOX).
Associations Include autoimmune disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis and
SLE). If <50yrs, it is commoner in  and associated with thymic hyperplasia; >50, it
is commoner in men, and associated with thymic atrophy or thymic tumour.
Tests • Antibodies: Anti-AChR antibodies in 90% (70% in MG variant confi ned to
ocular muscles). If anti-AChR Ωve look for MuSK antibodies (muscle-specifi c tyrosine
kinase; especially in ) .• EMG: Decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve
stimulation ± single-fi bre jitter. • Imaging: CT to exclude thymoma (68% 5yr sur-
vival). • Other: Ptosis improves by >2mm after ice application to the eyelid for
>2min—a neat, non-invasive test (but not diagnostic). The Tensilon® (edrophoni-
um) test may not give clear answers and has dangers, so is rarely used.
Treatment • Symptom control: Anticholinesterase, eg pyridostigmine (60–120mg
PO up to 6≈daily; max 1.2g/d). Cholinergic SE: salivation, lacrimation, sweats, vom-
iting, miosis. Other SE: diarrhoea, colic (controllable with propant he line 15mg/8h).
• Immunosuppression: Treat relapses with prednisolone—start at 5mg on alter-
nate days,  by 5mg/wk up to 1mg/kg on each treatment day. Dose on remis-
sion (may take months). Give osteo porosis prophylaxis. SE: weakness (hence low
starting dose). Azathioprine, ciclosporin, and mycophenolate mofetil may also be
used. • Thymectomy: Has benefi cial eff ects, even in patients without a thymoma:
consider especially in younger patients with onset <5yrs previously and poor re-
sponse to medical therapy. A recent randomized controlled trial shows improved
symptom scores sustained over 3yrs, with reduced need for immunosuppression.
Surgery also prevents local invasion if thymoma is present.
Myasthenic crisis Life-threatening weakness of respiratory muscles during a re-
lapse. Can be diffi cult to diff erentiate from cholinergic crisis (ie overtreatment—
but this is rare, and usually only occurs in doses of pyridostigmine >960mg/d).
Monitor forced vital capacity. Ventilatory support may be needed. Treat with
plasmapheresis (removes AChR antibodies from the circulation) or IVIg and identify
and treat the trigger for the relapse (eg infection, medications).
Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)
LEMS can be paraneoplastic (50% are associated with malignancies, in particular
small-cell lung cancer) or autoimmune. Unlike MG, antibodies are to voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels on pre-synaptic memb rane (see fi g 10.33; anti-P/Q type VGCC antibodies
are +ve in 85–95%).
Clinical features •Gait diffi culty before eye signs. •Autonomic involvement (dry
mouth, constipation, impotence). •Hyporefl exia and weakness, which improve after
exercise. •Dip lo pia and respiratory muscle involvement are rare. •EMG shows similar
changes to MG except amplitude increases greatly post-exercise.
Treatment Pyridostigmine, 3,4-diaminopyridine or IVIg (get specialist help). Do
regular CXR/high-resolution CT as symptoms may precede the cancer by >4yrs.

How synapses work—the neuromuscular junction
1 Before transmission can occur, neurotransmitter must be packed into synaptic
vesicles. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) this is acetylcholine (ACh). Each
vesicle contains ~8000 ACh molecules.
2 When an action potential arrives at the pre-synaptic terminal, depolarization
opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCS). In Lambert–Eaton syndrome, anti-
P/Q type VGCC antibodies disrupt this stage of synaptic transmission.15
3 Infl ux of Ca2+ through the VGCCs triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles with the
pre-synaptic membrane (a process that botulinum toxin interferes with), and
neurotransmitter is released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft.
4 Transmitter molecules cross the synaptic cleft by diff usion and bind to re-
ceptors on the post-synaptic membrane, causing depolarization of the post-
synaptic membrane (the end-plate potential). This change in the post-synaptic
membrane triggers muscle contraction at the NMJ, or onward transmission of
the action potential in neurons. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies block the
post-synaptic ACh receptors, preventing the end-plate potential from becom-
ing large enough to trigger muscle contraction—and muscle weakness ensues.
5 Transmitter action is terminated by enzyme-induced degradation of transmit-
ter (eg acetylcholinesterase), uptake into the pre-synaptic terminal or glial
cells, or by diff usion away from synapse. Anticholinesterase treatments for
myasthenia gravis, such as pyridostigmine, reduce the rate of degradation of
ACh, increasing the chance that it will trigger an end-plate potential.

Neurofi bromatosis
Type 1 neurofi bromatosis (NF1, von Recklinghausen’s disease)
Autosomal dominant inheritance (gene locus 17q11.2). Expression of NF1 is variable,
even within a family. Prevalence: 1 in 2500, :≈1:1; no racial predilection.
Signs: Café-au-lait spots: fl at, coff ee-coloured patches of skin seen in 1st year of
life (clearest in UV light), increasing in size and number with age. Adults have ≥6,
>15mm across. They do not predispose to skin cancer. Freckling: typically in skin-
folds (axillae, groin, neck base, and submammary area), and usually present by age
10. Dermal neurofi bromas: small, violaceous nodules,
gelatinous in texture, which appear at puberty, and
may become papillomatous. They are not painful but
may itch. Numbers increase with age. Nodular neuro-
fi bromas arise from nerve trunks. Firm and clearly
demarcated, they can give rise to paraesthesiae if
pressed. Lisch nodules (fi g 10.34) are tiny harmless
regular brown/transl ucent mounds (hamartomas)
on the iris (use a slit lamp) 2mm in diameter. They

Complications: Occur in 30%. Mild learning disabil ity is comm on. Local effects of
neurofi bromas: nerve root compression (weakness, pain, paraesthesiae); GI—bleeds,
obstruction; bone—cystic lesions, scoliosis, pseudarth rosis. BP from renal artery ste-
nosis or phaeochromo cytoma. Plexiform neurofi bromas (large, subcutaneous swell-
ings). Malignancy (5% patients with NF1): optic glioma, sarcomatous change in a
neurofi broma. Epilepsy risk (slight). Rare association: carcinoid syndrome (p271).
Management: Multidisciplinary team with geneticist, neuro logist, surgeon, and
physiotherapist, orchestrated by a GP. Yearly cutaneous survey and measurement
of BP. Dermal neurofi bromas are unsightly, and catch on clothing; if troublesome,
excise, but removing all lesions is unrealistic. Genetic counselling is vital (OHCS p154).
Type 2 neurofi bromatosis (NF2)
Autosomal dominant inheritance, though 50% are de novo, with mosaicism in some
(NF2 gene locus is 22q11). Rarer than NF1 with a prevalence of only 1 in 35 000.
Signs: Café-au-lait spots are fewer than in NF1. Bilateral vestibular Schwannomas
(= acoustic neuromas; p462) are characteristic, becoming symptomatic by ~20yrs old
when sensorineural hearing loss is the 1st sign. There may be tinnitus and vertigo.
The rate of tumour growth is unpredictable and variable. The tumours are benign
but cause problems by pressing on local structures and by ICP. They may be absent
in mosaic NF2. Juvenile posterior subcapsular lenticular opacity (a form of cata-
ract) occurs before other manifest ations and can be useful in screening those at risk.
Complications: Tender Schwannomas of cranial and peripheral nerves, and spinal
nerve roots. Meningiomas (45% in NF2, often multiple). Glial tumours are less common.
Consider NF2 in any young person presenting with one of these tumours in isolation.
Management: Hearing tests yearly from puberty in aff ected families, with MRI brain
if abnormality is detected. A normal MRI in the late teens is helpful in assessing risk
to any off spring. A clear scan at 30yrs (unless a family history of late onset) indi-
cates that the gene has not been inherited. Treatment of vestibular Schwannomas is
neurosurgical and complicated by hearing loss/deterioration and facial palsy. Mean
survival from diagnosis is ~ 15yrs.
Schwannomatosis Multiple tender cutaneous Schwannomas without the bilat-
eral vestibular Schwannomas that are characteristic of NF2. Indistinguishable from
mosaic NF2, where vestibular Schwannomas are also absent, except by genetic
analysis of tumour biopsies. There is typically a large tumour load, assessable only
by whole-body MRI. Mutations in the tumour suppressor genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1
and spontaneous NF2 mutations have all been described. Life expectancy is normal.

Syringomyelia
A syrinx is a tubular cavity in or close to the central canal of the cervical cord. Mean
age of onset: 30yrs. Incidence: 8/100 000/yr. Symptoms may be static for years, but
then worsen fast—eg on coughing or sneezing, as pressure causes extension, eg into
the brainstem (syringobulbia, see later in topic).
Causes Typically, blocked CSF circulation (without 4th ventricular communic-
ation), with fl ow from basal posterior fossa to caudal space, eg Arnold–Chiari
malformation (cerebellum herniates through foramen magnum); basal arachnoidi-
tis (after infection, irradiation, subarachnoid haemorrhage); basilar invagination
(in which the top of the odontoid process of C2 migrates upwards, causing fora-
men magnum stenosis ± medulla oblongata compression); masses (cysts, rheu-
matoid pannus, encephalocoele, tumours). Less commonly, a syrinx may develop
after myelitis, cord trauma, or rupture of an AV malformation, or within spinal
tumours (ependymoma or haemangioblastoma) due to fl uid secreted from neo-
plastic cells or haemorrhage.
Signs Dissociated sensory loss (absent pain and T° sensation, with preserved
light touch, vibration, and joint-position sense) due to pressure from the syrinx
on the decussating antero lateral pathway (fi g 10.35) in a root dis tribution refl ect-
ing the location of the syrinx (eg for typical cervical syrinx then sensory loss is
over trunk and arms); wasting/weakness of hands ± claw-hand (then armssho-
uldersrespirat ory muscles). Anterior horn cells are also vulnerable. Other signs:
Horner’s syndrome (can be bilateral and therefore more diffi cult to spot); UMN leg
signs; body asymm etry, limb hemi-
hypert rophy, or unil at eral odo- or
chiromegaly (enlarged hand or foot),
perhaps from release of trophic fac-
tors via anterior horn cells; Char-
cot’s joints in the shoulder/wrist
due to lost joint prop rio ception (see
fi g 5.11, p213).
Syringo bulbia (Brains tem involve-
ment.) Nyst agmus, tongue atro-
phy, dysphagia, pharyngeal/palatal
weak ness, Vth nerve sensory loss.
MRI imaging How big is the syrinx?
Any base-of-brain (Chiari) malfor-
mation?
Surgery Don’t wait for gross dete-
rioration to occur. Decompression at
the foramen magnum may be tried
in Chiari malformati ons to promote
free fl ow of CSF, and so prevent syrinx
dilatation. Surgery may reduce pain
and progression. Fig 10.35 The anterolateral system.

Retroviruses and neurology
HIV and AIDS (p398.) Can have multiple neurological manifestations: these conditions
are part of the diff erential diagnosis of meningitis, intrac ranial mass lesions, demen-
tia, encephalomyelitis, cord problems, and peripheral neuropathies.
Acute infection: May be associated with transient aseptic meningoencephalitis
(typically self-limiting), myelo pathy, and neuropathy.
Opportunistic infections: Arise during low CD4 counts, which allow unusual or atyp-
ical organisms to infect the nervous system: • Toxoplasma gondii (p400) is the main
CNS pathogen in AIDS, causing cerebral abscesses which present with focal signs, eg
seizures, hemiparesis. CT/MRI shows ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions. Treat
with pyrimethamine (+folinic acid) + sulfadiazine or clindamycin for 6 months. Con-
tinue secondary prophylaxis until CD4 count >200. Pneumocys tis prophylaxis also
protects against toxoplasmosis. • Cryptococcus neof orm ans (fi g 10.36) causes a
chronic meningitis with fever and headache (neck stiff ness may be absent). Cogni-
tion alters slowly, seizures and coma may follow. Treat with amphotericin followed
by fl uconazole. • Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause encephalopathy. • Progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by the JC virus. There is progres-
sive white matter infl ammation. Mortality even with antiretroviral therapy is around
50% at 1yr. • Syphilis and TB may also cause meningitis.
Tumours: Aff ecting the CNS include primary cerebral lymphoma (associated with EBV)
and B-cell lymphoma. CSF JC virus PCR is useful in distinguishing PML from lymphoma.
Neuropathies: Common in HIV, and may be a result of the disease itself or antiret-
roviral therapy. Up to 30% of patients have a peripheral neuropathy, which is pain-
ful and predominantly sensory. Other clinical pictures include polyradiculopathy,
mononeuritis multiplex, and proximal myopathy.
Chronic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND): While antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) has decreased the incidence of CNS complications in HIV/AIDS, people are
living longer with the disease, and chronic complications such as HIV-associated de-
mentia are increasing. This occurs in 7–15%, late in the disease, and usually when the
CD4 count is <200. Progressive behavioural changes are seen along with subcortical
features: memory loss, poor attention, and bradykinesia. Various encephalopathies
may also contribute to this, eg PML.
Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) Is another retrovirus with neurologi-
cal manifestations, though much more rarely than HIV (~0.5%). It causes: Tropical
spastic paraplegia, a slowly progressing myelopathy, typically aff ecting the tho-
racic area. There may be paraesthesiae, sensory loss, and disorders of micturition.
Demyelinating polyneuropathy and ataxia may also occur.

The Other Side, by Kate Granger MBE, FRCP,
1981–2016.
Kate Granger, a medical registrar then consult-
ant geriatrician, was diagnosed with a desmo-
plastic small round cell tumour at the age of
29. This is a cancer that medical science has no
answer to. But Kate had her own answer. She
turned her terminal diagnosis on its head and
began a dialogue on death and dying, off ering
her experience as an inspirational lesson in
compassion and care. Before you are a patient,
before you have cancer, but most importantly,
before you are a doctor, you are simply a human
being. And if your humanity is lost or forgotten,
then you cannot care, even if medical science
is able to provide an answer. hellomynameis.org.uk;

Looking after people with cancer
Cancer will aff ect 50% of people born after 1960 and >25% of all deaths in the UK
are from cancer.1 While many may not appreciate the poor prognosis attached
to diagnoses such as liver failure or heart failure, ‘cancer’ has a widespread as-
sociation with suff ering and death. Yet ‘cancer’ is not a homogenous disease but
a group of conditions with prognoses ranging from very good (98% 10yr survival
for testicular cancer) to extremely poor (21% 1yr survival for pancreatic cancer).1
Communication2 is the fi rst step on a cancer pathway and underpins whatever
that diagnosis may subsequently entail for the individual. A range of overwhelm-
ing feelings can surface upon receiving a cancer diagnosis: shock, numbness, deni-
al, panic, anger, resignation (‘I knew all along…’). Preconceptions, possibly derived
vicariously from friends and family, may be deeply embedded leading to despair
or inappropriate optimism. Without an understanding of your patient’s starting
point, you may fail to be eff ective in your guidance and support.
Tips for the discussion of a cancer diagnosis
1 Set the environment up carefully. Choose a quiet place where you will not be
disturbed. Make sure family or friends are present according to your patient’s
wishes. Anticipate likely questions and be sure of your facts.
2 Find out what the patient already knows and believes (often a great deal).
‘What are you worried about today?’
3 Give some warning: ‘There is some bad news for us to address’.
4 Ascertain how much the person wants to know. ‘Are you someone who likes
to know all the details about your condition?’ Although information is a prior-
ity for the majority of cancer patients, this may change with the individual,
and the course of the disease. ‘Monitors’ will seek information, ‘blunters’ will
distract themselves.
5 Share information about diagnosis and treatments. Specifi cally list support-
ing people (oncology multidisciplinary team) and institutions (hospices). Break
information down into manageable chunks and check understanding for each.
6 Invite questions patients may feel they cannot ask. ‘Is there anything else you
want me to explain?’ Do not hesitate to go over the same ground repeatedly.
Allow denial, don’t force the pace, give time. Listen to any concerns raised,
encourage the airing of feelings. Empathize.
7 Address prognosis. Be honest. Doctors are often too optimistic. Encourage
an appropriate level of hope (see BOX ‘Spiritual pain’, p535), refer to an expert.
8 Make a plan. The desire to be involved in decisions about treatment is vari-
able: your patient’s locus of control can be internal (desire control of their
own destiny) or external (passive acceptance). Decision-making can be im-
mediate, deferred, panicked, or rationally deliberated. Time may be required
to facilitate any style of decision-making: your plan may be simply to come
back and talk again.
9 Summarize, and off er availability. Record details of your conversation includ-
ing the language used.
10 Follow through. Leave your patient with the knowledge that you are with
them, and that your unwritten contract will not be broken.
No rules guarantee success. Use whatever your patient gives you—closely observe
both verbal and non-verbal cues. Getting to know your patient, seeking out the
right expert for each stage of treatment, and making an agreed management
plan, are all required.
For any situation which involves the communication of bad news, consider
SPIKES:3
• Setting up the interview.
• Assess the patient’s Perception of the situation.
• Obtain an Invitation (asking the patient’s permission to explain).
• Give Knowledge and information to the patient.
• Address the Emotional response with Empathy.
• Strategy and Summary: aim for consensus with patient and family.

The genetics of cancer
How cancers develop
Human life requires cells which are capable of dividing millions of times. These
cells need to be able to adapt and change so that diff erent tissues and organs
can be formed. They need to command their own blood supply. Without extensive
mechanisms to control cell growth and prevent the replication of abnormal cells,
these requirements for life become the basis for the development of a cancer.
Failure of control mechanisms causes cancer.
Cancer is a genetic disease. Genetic changes occur in pathways associated with
cell growth, cell diff erentiation, and cell death. Mutations can be inherited or ac-
quired. Acquired or somatic errors occur due to age, exposure to carcinogens, and
in unchecked rapid cell turnover. Mutations result in:
• ‘gain of function’ oncogenes that have pathological activity in the absence of a
relevant signal. For example, ras is a protein involved in signal transduction. It is
mutated in ~30% of human cancers. Oncogenes behave in a dominant manner:
mutation to one allele results in unchecked activation.
• ‘loss of function’ tumour suppressor genes no longer act as inhibitors of pro-
malignant processes. In most cases, mutations to both alleles must occur for a
cancer phenotype. This can occur either as two separate somatic events, or in
the case of predisposition genes, the fi rst ‘hit’ is inherited and the second oc-
curs somatically. Tumours therefore occur earlier and more frequently in familial
cancers. p53 is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in ~50% of human cancers.
Most cancers arise from multiple mutations. This is perhaps best represented in
the stepwise accumulation of mutations in colorectal cancer (fi g 11.2). An under-
standing of the molecular biology of cancer facilitates drug development (fi g 11.3).

Hereditary cancer syndromes
A hereditary cancer4 is suggested by:
• unusual early age or presentation (eg male breast cancer)
• multiple primary cancers or bilateral/multifocal cancers
• clustering of cancers in relatives
• cancers in multiple generations
• rare tumours (eg retinoblastoma) or histology (medullary thyroid cancer, p223)
• ethnicity (eg Ashkenazi heritage and breast cancer).
Genetic testing is appropriate if the sensitivity and specifi city of the test are good
enough, and if the result of the test will impact diagnosis and management (see p27).
Breast/ovarian cancer
~5–10% of breast cancers are due to mutations in BRCA1 (17q) or BRCA2 (13q).4,5
Both genes function as tumour suppressors although they are dominant: a cancer
phenotype can be seen when one copy of the gene is normal. A BRCA1 mutation
confers a 55–65% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 39% risk of ovarian cancer.
For BRCA2, the risk of breast cancer is 45% (6% in aff ected males), and 11% for
ovarian cancer. Mutations are also linked to prostate, peritoneal, and pancreatic
cancers. TP53 mutations (somatic >inherited) also confer a risk of breast cancer.
Refer if:
• 1st-degree relative with: breast cancer <40yrs, male breast cancer, bilateral breast
cancer <50yrs
• 1st- and 2nd-degree relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer
• three 1st- or 2nd-degree relatives with breast cancer
• risk assessment calculation of >3% risk in 10yrs or lifetime risk ≥17%
• other: Ashkenazi ancestry, sarcoma <45yrs, multiple cancers at a young age.
Genetic counselling and testing for BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 mutations is off ered if
calculated risk of mutation is >10%. If known BRCA1/2 mutation, off er women annual
MRI 30–49yrs and annual mammograpy 50–69yrs (MRI 20–69yrs if TP53 mutation). Pro-
phylactic tamoxifen or raloxifene may be appropriate depending on tolerance and
VTE/endometrial cancer risk. Surgical management (mastectomy/oophorectomy)
should only be via a specialist MDT.
Colorectal cancer
~25% have a family history. ~5% have identifi ed mutations. Refer to specialist genet-
ic service if: two 1st-degree relatives with colorectal cancer at average age <60yrs,
or if criteria for an autosomal dominant colorectal cancer syndrome is met:
• Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)): 1–3%
of colorectal cancer. Autosomal dominant due to mutations in mismatch repair
genes. Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer up to ~80%. Increased risk of other ‘Lynch
cancers’: endometrium, ovary, urinary tract, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary
tract. Suspect if ≥3 aff ected relatives (one 1st-degree), from two successive gen-
erations, of whom one was aff ected <50yrs old. Colonoscopic surveillance (at least
biennial) from 25–75yrs.
• Familial adenomatous polyposis: Due to mutations in the APC tumour suppressor
gene (5q) (fi g 11.2). <1% of colorectal cancer. Causes multiple colorectal adenomas
(>100 in classical disease) which undergo malignant transformation. Gene pen-
etrance approaches 100% by 50yrs. Surveillance sigmoidoscopy from 12yrs, with
prophylactic surgery usually <25yrs guided by polyp number, size, and dysplasia.
• Peutz–Jeghers syndrome: 1 in 25 000–280 000. Hamartomatous polpys. 10–20%
risk of colorectal cancer, ~50–60% risk of GI cancer, ~60% risk of breast cancer.
Due to germline mutations in STK11, a tumour suppressor gene (19p14). Surveillance
in all (see p708).
Prostate cancer
5–10% (~50% disease <55yrs) estimated to be due to inherited factors. Genes include
BRCA1, BRCA2, mismatch repair, and HOXB13 which interacts with androgen receptor.
Age and race contribute. See p530 for screening.
Other familial cancer syndromes Von Hippel–Lindau (p320, p712), Carney complex
(p223), MEN (p223), neurofi bromatosis (p514).

Cancer diagnosis
A variety of clinical signs and symptoms should alert you to the possible presence of
malignancy. The following list is based on clinical features with a 3% positive predic-
tive value for cancer.6 It is by no means exhaustive and does not negate the value of
clinical judgement. Urgent = within 2 weeks.
Lung

• fi nger clubbing
• supraclavicular/cervical lymphadenopathy
• thrombocytosis
• two of: cough, fatigue, SOB, chest pain, weight loss, appetite, smoker, asbestos.
Upper GI
• Urgent endoscopy if: dysphagia, or >55yrs with weight loss and upper abdominal
pain/refl ux/dyspepsia.
• Urgent referral if: >40yrs plus jaundice, or upper abdominal mass.
• Urgent CT of the pancreas if >60yrs plus weight loss plus any of: diarrhoea, back
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, new-onset diabetes.
• Non-urgent endoscopy if:
• >55yrs and one of: treatment-resistant dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain plus
low Hb, plts, or N&V plus upper GI symptoms/weight loss
• haematemesis.
Lower GI
PR examination and FBC in all.
• Urgent referral if: positive faecal occult blood, >40yrs with abdominal pain plus
weight loss, >50yrs with unexplained rectal bleeding, >60yrs with iron-defi cient
anaemia or change in bowel habit.
• Consider urgent referral if: rectal/abdominal mass, anal ulceration, <50yrs with
rectal bleeding plus lower GI symptoms or weight loss or iron-defi ciency anaemia.
• Faecal occult blood testing if: >50yrs plus abdominal pain or weight loss, <60yrs
with change in bowel habit or iron-defi ciency anaemia, >60yrs and anaemia.
Gynaecological
• Urgent referral if: ascites, pelvic mass (fi broid excluded), >55yrs with post-meno-
pausal bleeding.
Breast
• Urgent referral if: >30yrs with unexplained breast lump, >50yrs with symptoms or
change to one nipple.
• Consider urgent referral if: skin changes, >30yrs with axillary lump.
Urology
• Urgent referral if:
• irregular prostate on PR, abnormal age-specifi c PSA (see p530)
• >40yrs with unexplained visible haematuria, >60yrs with unexplained non-
visible haematuria plus dysuria or WCC
• non-painful enlargement or change in shape/texture of testicle.
Central nervous system
• Urgent MRI in progressive, sub-acute loss of central neurological function.
Unexplained weight loss, appetite, and DVT can be non-specifi c signs of cancer.
Assess for any additional risk factors, symptoms, signs, and refer accordingly.

Cancer and the multidisciplinary team
The care of all patients diagnosed with cancer is formally reviewed by a multidis-
ciplinary team (MDT). The aim of the MDT is to coordinate high-quality diagnosis,
treatment, and care. The MDT should make a recommendation on the best initial
treatment for cancer. Note: an MDT can only ‘recommend’; the decision must be
made in consultation with the patient. The MDT is made up of healthcare profes-
sionals with expertise in treating and supporting patients with cancer. Members
should include, but are not limited to:
• lead clinician and lead nurse specialist
• radiologists (see BOX ‘Interventional oncology’, p527)
• histopathologists
• expert surgeons, eg upper GI, colorectal, breast, plastics
• oncologists (medical and clinical)
• palliative care physicians
• nominated member to support ongoing clinical trials
• patient representative
• administrative support.
Cancer staging
Staging systems are used to describe the extent of a cancer. This is vital to deter-
mine the most appropriate treatment, to assess prognosis, and to identify relevant
clinical trials. A cancer is always referred to by the stage given at diagnosis. The
TNM system is most widely used and is based on the extent of tumour (T), spread to
lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M) (table 11.1).
Table 11.1 TNM cancer staging
Tx Primary tumour cannot be measured Nx Nodes cannot be assessed
T0 Primary tumour cannot be found N0 No node involvement

4=large tumour/extensive invasion) M1 Distant metastases
Other prefi xes may also be used: c refers to clinical stage; p is the stage after
pathological examination; y refers to stage after neoadjuvant therapy; r is used if
a tumour is re-staged after a disease-free interval; a indicates stage at autopsy.
The TNM staging may be converted to an overall, less detailed classifi cation of
cancer stage: 0–IV. Stage 0 refers to carcinoma in situ; Stages I–III describe the
size of cancer and/or nearby spread; Stage IV indicates metastatic disease.
Some cancers may have alternative staging systems such as Duke’s classifi ca-
tion for colorectal cancer (p616). See also lung cancer (p176); breast cancer (p602);
oesophageal cancer (p618); bladder cancer (p647).
Cancer imaging
Imaging is essential in oncology for diagnosis, prognosis, and to inform and guide
treatment. As well as plain radiographs, ultrasound scans, CT, and MRI; there is a
wealth of more specialist imaging including:
PET-CT: PET uses a non-specifi c radioactive tracer (FDG) which highlights areas of
increased metabolism, cell proliferation, or hypoxia. It therefore accumulates in
cancer cells >non-cancer cells. PET-CT is a powerful combination of anatomical (CT)
and functional (PET) information allowing diagnosis, increased accuracy of staging,
and assessment of treatment response.
Monoclonal antibodies: Radio-labelled tumour antibodies specifi c to the tumour
under investigation, eg prostate specifi c membrane antigen, somatostatin (neu-
roendocrine tumours), oestrogen receptor (breast). They can off er better specifi c-
ity than standard PET images. (For monoclonal antibodies in treatment see p524.)
Bone scintigraphy (bone scan): Detects abnormal metabolic activity in bones
including bone metastases.

Cancer treatment: medicine and surgery
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy7 is the use of any chemical substance to treat disease. In modern-
day use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of
cancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which
is expressed diff erently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at
intervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue. Chemotherapy is
the only systemic treatment for cancer (surgery and radiotherapy are local treat-
ments). This is important as most cancers are considered to be systemic either due
to metastases, or the potential to metastasize in the future. Chemotherapy should
be prescribed and given only under expert guidance by people trained in its use.
Includes:
• Single-agent: Rarely curative as genetically resistant cells are selected out.
• Combination chemotherapy: A combination of drugs with diff erent mechanisms
of action and diff erent side-eff ect profi les reduces the likelihood of resistance and
toxicity. The drugs used should have:
• cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission
• diff erent mechanisms of action, ideally additive or synergistic eff ects
• non-overlapping toxicity to maximize benefi t of full therapeutic doses
• diff erent mechanisms of resistance.
• Adjuvant: After other initial treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, eg following
surgical removal of, eg breast, bowel cancer.
• Neoadjuvant: Used to shrink tumours prior to surgical or radiological treatment.
May allow later treatment to be more conservative.
• Palliative: No curative aim, off ers symptom relief, may prolong survival.
Classes of cytotoxic drugs
• Alkylating agents: Anti-proliferative drugs that bind via alkyl groups to DNA lead-
ing to apoptotic cell death, eg cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan.
• Angiogenesis inhibitors: Eg bevacizumab, afl ibercept, sunitinib.
• Antimetabolites: Interfere with cell metabolism including DNA and protein synthe-
sis, eg methotrexate, 5-fl uorouracil.
• Antioestrogens: Aromatoase inhibitors (eg letrozole, anastrozole), oestrogen
receptor antagonists (eg tamoxifen, raloxifene) used in breast cancer treatment.
• Antitumour antibiotics: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin,
mitomycin, bleomycin.
• Monoclonal antibodies: Antibodies to a specifi c tumour antigen can slow tumour
growth by enhancing host immunity, or be conjugated with chemotherapy/radioac-
tive isotopes to allow targeted treatment. Expect more of these in future.
• Topoisomerase inhibitors: Interrupt regulation of DNA winding, eg etoposide.
• Vinca alkaloids and taxanes: ‘Spindle poisons’ which target mechanisms of cell
division, eg vincristine, vinblastine, docetaxel.
Side-eff ects
Due to cytotoxic eff ects on non-cancer cells. Greatest eff ect seen on dividing cells, ie
gut, hair, bone marrow, gametes (see BOX ‘Fertility and cancer’, p525).
• Vomiting: Prophylaxis given with most cytotoxic regimens (see p251).
• Alopecia: May profoundly impact quality of life. Consider ‘cold-cap’, wig services.
• Neutropenia: Most commonly seen 7–14d after chemotherapy. Neutropenic sep-
sis is life-threatening and needs urgent assessment and empirical treatment (p352).
Extravasation of chemotherapy
Extravasation8 = inadvertent infi ltration of a drug into subcutaneous/subdermal
tissue. Presentation: Tingling, burning, pain, redness, swelling, no ‘fl ashback’/re-
sistance from cannula. Management: Stop and disconnect infusion. Aspirate any
residual drug before cannula removed. Follow local policies (ask for the ‘extravasa-
tion kit’). Follow any drug-specifi c recommendations. For DNA-binding drugs (an-
thracyclines, alkylating agents, antitumour antibiotics), use a dry cold compress to
vasoconstrict and  drug spread. For non-DNA-binding drugs (vinca alkaloids, taxa-
nes, platin salts), use a dry warm compress to vasodilate and  drug distribution.

Surgery
• Prevention: Risk-reducing surgery, eg thyroidectomy in MEN (p223), colectomy
in FAP (p521).
• Screening: Endoscopy, colposcopy.
• Diagnosis and staging: Fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum-
assisted biopsy, excisional/incisional biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, endos-
copy, diagnostic/staging laparoscopy, laparascopic ultrasound.
• Treatment: Resection of solid tumour (may be combined with chemo/radio-
therapy).
• Reconstruction: Eg following treatment for breast, head and neck cancers.
• Palliation: Bypass, stoma, stenting, pathological fractures.
Clinical trials
• Advantages: Possibility of more eff ective treatment than currently available,
close monitoring with direct access to a research team, reassurance from in-
creased number of clinical encounters, gain from altruism.
• Disadvantages: Possibility of receiving therapy that is no better or worse than
standard therapy, unknown toxicity from new agents, time-consuming, anxiety
from increased number of clinical encounters.
You may look after patients who are participating in clinical trials. For many of
these, you will not be familiar with the trial therapy or even know which therapy
the patient is receiving: a new therapy, an old therapy, or placebo. Contact the
research team to discuss any clinical concerns or change in treatment. Contact
details should be recorded in the patient’s notes. Look in the notes for, or ask the
patient if they have a copy of the ‘Participant Information Sheet’ which is manda-
tory for all UK research studies.
Information on relevant trials for your patient is available:
• Cancer Research UK (www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/fi nd-a-clinical-trial).
• UK Clinical Trials Gateway (www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk).
Fertility and cancer
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may:
• damage spermatogonia causing impaired spermatogenesis or male sterility
• hasten oocyte depletion leading to premature ovarian failure.
If cancer treatment carries a risk of infertility, fertility preservation techniques9
should be discussed prior to treatment being given.
• Men: Semen cryopreservation should be off ered before treatment due to the risk
of genetic damage in sperm after initiation of chemotherapy. Intracytoplasmic
sperm injection means that even a small amount of banked sperm can be used
successfully in the future.
• Women: Cryopreservation of:
1 Embryos
2 Oocytes: if ethical objections to embryo preservation or no partner
3 Ovarian tissue: no ovarian stimulation required, experimental technique.
Ovarian transposition (oophoropexy) may be possible prior to pelvic radiothera-
py but protection is not guaranteed due to radiation scatter.
Beau’s lines
Beau’s lines (fi g 11.4) are horizontal depressions in
the nail plate that run parallel to the moon-shaped
portion of the nail bed. They result from a sudden in-
terruption of nail keratin synthesis and may be due
to local infection/trauma, systemic illness, or from
medication (p76). Each line in this photo coincided with
a round of chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Cancer treatment: radiotherapy
Radiotherapy10 is used in >50% of all cancer and forms part of treatment in 40%
of those considered cured. It uses ionizing radiation to cause damage to DNA. This
prevents cell division and leads to cell death. The aim of radiotherapy treatment is to
inactivate cancer cells without causing a severe reaction in normal tissue.
Radical treatment Given with curative intent. Total dose ranges from 40–70 gray
(Gy) in up to 40 fractions. Some regimens involve several smaller fractions a day
with a gap of 6–8h. Combined chemoradiation is used in some sites, eg anus and
oesophagus, to increase response rate.
Palliative radiotherapy Aims to relieve symptoms, may not impact on survival.
Doses are smaller and given in fewer fractions to off er short-term tumour control
with minimal side-eff ects. Palliation is used for brain metastases, spinal cord com-
pression, visceral compression, and bleeding, eg haemoptysis, haematuria. Bone pain
from metastases can be reduced or eliminated in 60% of cases.
Early reactions
Occur ~2 weeks into treatment, peak ~2–4 weeks after treatment.
• Tiredness: ~80%. Improves ~4 weeks after treatment completed but chronic in
~30%. Advise patients to stay as active as possible.
• Skin reactions: Include erythema, dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and
ulceration. Aqueous cream can be used on unbroken areas.
• Mucositis: All patients receiving head and neck treatment should have a dental
check-up before therapy. Avoid smoking. Antiseptic mouthwashes may help. Aspi-
rin gargle and other soluble analgesics can be tried. Treat oral thrush with fl ucona-
zole 50mg/24h PO, nystatin may exacerbate nausea.
• Nausea and vomiting: Occur when stomach, liver, or brain treated. Try metoclo-
pramide 10mg/8h PO (dopamine antagonist), domperidone 10mg/8h PO (blocks the
central chemoreceptor trigger zone), or ondansetron 4–8mg/8h PO/IV (serotonin
5HT3 antagonist) (see p251).
• Diarrhoea: Usually after abdominal or pelvic treatments. Maintain good hydration.
Avoid high-fi bre agents. Try loperamide 2mg PO after loose stools (max 16mg/24h).
• Dysphagia: Following thoracic treatments. Speech and language input, nutrition.
• Cystitis: After pelvic treatments. Drink plenty of fl uid.
Late reactions
Months-years after treatment.
• CNS/PNS: Somnolence: 4–6wks after brain radiotherapy. Consider steroid dose.
Spinal cord myelopathy: progressive weakness. MRI to exclude cord compr ession.
Brachial plexopathy: numb, weak, or painful arm after axillary radio therapy.
• Lung: Pneumonitis can occur 6–12wks after thoracic treatment causing dry cough
± dyspnoea. Bronchodilators and tapered steroids may help.
• GI: Xerostomia = reduced saliva. Dental care and nutrition important. Treat with
water, saliva substitutes, salivary stimulants. Benign strictures of oesophagus or
bowel. Treat with dilatation. Seek a specialist surgical opinion regarding fi stulae.
Radiation proctitis may be a problem after prostate irradiation.
• GU: Urinary frequency: small fi brosed bladder after pelvic treatment. Vaginal
stenosis, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction can occur after pelvic radiotherapy.
fertility: due to pelvic radiotherapy (see p525).
• Endocrine: Panhypopituitarism following radical treatment involving pituitary
fossa. Check hormone profi le in children: growth hormone replacement may be
required. Hypothyroidism in ~50% after neck treatment: check TFTs annually.
• Secondary cancers: Risk (2–4 per 10 000 person-years) is usually insignifi cant
compared to recurrence/death from primary lesion. More important for younger
patients after curative treatment. Women <35yrs receiving radiotherapy for Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma should be off ered breast screening from 8yrs after treatment.
 Cancer survival means  numbers living with poor health or disability after treat-
ment (~625 000 in UK). Remember the emotional and physical impact of cancer ex-
tends beyond the prescribed course of radiotherapy/chemotherapy.

Methods of delivering radiotherapy
Conventional external beam radiotherapy (EBRT): Is the most common form of
treatment. Delivers beams of ionizing radiation to the patient from an external linear
accelerator.
Stereotactic radiotherapy is a highly accurate form of EBRT used to target small
lesions with great precision—most frequently in treating intracranial tumours. It is
often referred to by the manufacturer’s name, eg Gamma Knife®, Truebeam®.
Brachytherapy involves a radiation source being placed within or close to a tumour,
allowing a high local radiation dose. Implants may be placed within a cavity (eg
uterus, post-surgical space) or within tissue (eg prostate, breast).
Radioisotope therapy uses tumour-seeking radionuclides to target specifi c tissues.
For example, 131I (radioiodine) to ablate remaining thyroid tissue after thyroidectomy
for thyroid cancer.
Interventional oncology
Interventional oncology (IO) refers to interventional radiology procedures used in
the treatment or palliation of patients with cancer. IO can be divided into disease-
modifying and symptomatic procedures.
Disease-modifying IO:
Intended to modify cancer progression and/or to improve prognosis. Includes:
• Image-guided ablation, eg radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, irreversible
electroporation.
• Embolization, eg transarterial embolization, chemoembolization, selective inter-
nal radiation therapy.
• Image-guided brachytherapy.
• Isolated perfusion chemotherapy: uses occlusion techniques to protect normal
tissue from high doses of chemotherapy.
Symptomatic IO:
Provides relief from cancer-related symptoms, but does not modify the underlying
disease process. The techniques (table 11.2) can off er signifi cantly improved qual-
ity of life, reduce admissions, and increase time spent outside of hospital.

Oncology emergencies
Emergencies11,12 in oncology include:
Neutropenic sepsis
Temperature >38oC and neutrophil count <0.5≈109/L. Suspect in all patients who are
unwell and within 6wks of receiving chemotherapy. Localizing signs may be absent.
Examine indwelling catheter sites. Immediate treatment saves lives. Use local
guidelines or treat empirically with piperacillin/tazobactam (see p352).
Spinal cord compression
3–5% of cancer patients have spinal metastases. ~15% of those with advanced can-
cers develop metastatic spinal cord compression. Most commonly associated with
lung, prostate, breast, myeloma, melanoma. Urgent treatment is required to pre-
serve neurological function and relieve pain.
Causes: Collapse or compression of a vertebral body due to metastases (common),
direct extension of a tumour into vertebral column (rare).
Signs and symptoms: Back pain in ~95%. Ask about nocturnal pain and pain with
straining. Worry if there is cervical/thoracic pain. Also limb weakness, diffi culty
walking, sensory loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction. Maintain a high index of suspicion.
Management: Admit for bed rest and arrange urgent (within 24h) MRI of the whole
spine. Give dexamethasone 16mg/24h PO with prophylatic gastroprotection, eg PPI,
and blood glucose monitoring. If reduced mobility consider thromboprophylaxis
(compression stockings, LMWH). Refer urgently to clinical oncology/cancer MDT. Ra-
diotherapy is the commonest treatment and should be given within 24 hours of MRI
diagnosis. Decompressive surgery ± radiotherapy may be appropriate depending on
prognosis. Patients with loss of motor function after >48h are unlikely to recover
function. (See also p466.)
Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome
Reduced venous return from head, neck, and upper limbs. Due to extrinsic compres-
sion (most common), or venous thrombosis (consider if current or past central ve-
nous access). SVC syndrome with airway compromise requires urgent treatment.
Causes: >90% of SVC syndrome results from malignancy. Most common cancers:
lung (~75%), lymphoma, metastatic (eg breast), thymoma, germ cell.
Signs and symptoms: Diagnosis is made clinically. SOB, orthop noea, stridor, pleth-
ora/cyanosis, oedema of face and arm, cough, headache, engorged neck veins (non-
pulsatile JVP), engorged chest wall veins. Pemberton’s test:1 elevation of the arms
to the side of the head causes facial plethora/cyanosis.
Management: Prop up. Assess for hypoxia (pulse oximetry, blood gas) and give
oxygen if needed. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h. CT is used to defi ne the anatomy of
the obstruction. Balloon venoplasty and SVC stenting provide the most rapid relief
of symptoms (see BOX ‘Interventional oncology’, p527). Treat with radiotherapy or
chemotherapy depending on the sensitivity of the underlying cancer.
Malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia
Most common metabolic abnormality in cancer patients: ~10–20% of patients with
cancer, ~40% of myeloma. It is a poor prognostic sign: 75% mortality within 3
months. Calcium is highly protein-bound and needs correcting to the serum albumin
concentration. PTH levels should be suppressed (see pp676–7).
Causes: PTH-related protein produced by the tumour (see p529), local osteolysis, eg
myeloma, tumour production of calcitriol.
Signs and symptoms: Weight loss, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, polyuria, constipa-
tion, abdominal pain, dehydration, weakness, confusion, seizure, coma.
Management: Aggressive rehydration. Bisphosphonates (if eGFR ≥30), eg zoledronic
acid IV, usually normalize calcium within 3 days and can be given as a repeated infu-
sion. Calcitonin produces a more rapid (2h) but short-term eff ect and tolerance can
develop. Long-term treatment is by cont rol of t he underlying malignancy.
1 Pemberton described this ‘useful’ sign of venous obstruction due to a goitre in 1946.

Brain metastases
Aff ect up to ~40% of patients with cancer. Most commonly: lung, breast, colorectal,
melanoma. Poor prognosis: median survival 1–2 months; better prognosis with single
lesion, breast cancer (see also p830).
Signs and symptoms: Headache (~50%, often worse in the morning, when cough-
ing or bending), focal neurological signs (~30%), ataxia (~21%), fi ts (~18%), nausea,
vomiting, papilloedema.
Management: Urgent CT/MRI depending on underlying diagnosis, disease stage, and
performance status. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h to reduce cerebral oedema. Stereo-
tactic radiotherapy (see p527). Discuss with neurosurgery, especially if large lesion
or associated hydrocephalus.
Tumour lysis syndrome
Chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating tumours (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma)
leads to cell death and urate, K+, phosphate, calcium. Risk of arrhythmia and renal
failure (see p314).
Management: Prevent with hydration and uricolytics, eg rasburicase, allopurinol.
Paraneoplastic syndromes
Paraneoplastic syndromes13 (table 11.3) consist of symptoms attributable to a malig-
nancy mediated by hormones, cytokines, or the cross-reaction of tumour antibodies.
They do not correlate with stage/prognosis and may pre-date other cancer symptoms.

Trousseau (fi g 11.5) was probably the fi rst to discover a
paraneoplastic syndrome. He noticed that many patients
with migratory thrombophlebitis (‘Trousseau’s sign’)
developed gastric cancer. Unfortunately, he developed
migratory thrombophlebitis himself and correctly pre-
dicted his own death from GI malignancy.

Tumour markers
Tumour markers14 are specifi c molecules (usually glycoproteins) that may be found in
higher concentrations in the serum, tissue, or urine in patients with certain cancers.
Tumour markers in diagnosis
Tumour markers are insuffi ciently sensitive or specifi c to be diagnostic in isolation.
• Many tumour markers are  in several cancers and benign conditions (table 11.4).
• Measuring ≥1 tumour marker is unlikely to aid diagnosis unless suspecting a germ
cell tumour.
• Do not make opportunistic requests for panels of tumour markers in patients with
non-specifi c symptoms: they are not helpful and lead to potentially unnecessary
investigation. This includes testing PSA in women and CA 125 in men.
• In carefully selected patients, in whom cancer is suspected, highly raised levels of
a tumour marker may be helpful:
• -fetoprotein (FP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in testicular/
germ cell tumours.
• CA 125 in combination with USS and menopausal status.
• FPin those at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
• PSA >100ng/mL usually indicates metastatic prostate cancer.
Tumour markers in monitoring
The main value of tumour markers is in monitoring patients known to have cancer.
This includes the course of the disease, the eff ectiveness of treatment, and the detec-
tion of cancer recurrence. The following markers may be useful:
• FP and hCG in testicular/germ cell tumours.
• CEA in colorectal cancer.
• CA 125 in ovarian cancer.
• A cautious interpretation of PSA within the limits of its specifi city and sensitivity.
Screening for cancer
The UK has several well-established cancer screening programmes. Women are
invited for mammography every 3yrs (50–70yrs) and off ered cervical smear tests
every 3–5yrs (25–64yrs). Men and women aged 60–74yrs are off ered faecal occult
blood testing every 2yrs.
Screening tests aim to pick out those who need further investigation to rule
out or diagnose a cancer, in the hope that earlier diagnosis and treatment result
in better outcomes. All screening tests come with risk: anxiety, harm/discomfort
from the test, cost, false positives resulting in further invasive tests, false nega-
tives conferring inappropriate reassurance when symptoms arise. When consider-
ing screening an asymptomatic population the potential risks and benefi ts need to
be weighed carefully and the Wilson criteria (see p23) should be satisfi ed.
Should PSA be used to screen for prostate cancer?
Most men with prostate cancer will have a high prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA). The
higher the PSA, the more likely cancer is. However, PSA is non-specifi c and also raised
in benign prostatic disease, BMI <25, recent ejaculation, recent rectal examination,
prostatitis, and UTI. 76% of patients with a raised PSA do not have cancer. Following
screening tests (see PROMIS study, 2017, for use of multi-parametric MRI), prostate
biopsy is required for diagnosis. This has an inherent risk of complications includ-
ing bleeding, infection, and urinary retention. ~1% will require hospital admission.
The risks of PSA testing and subsequent biopsy need to be counterbalanced by
benefi ts from screening.15 ~1 in 800 men avoid death from prostate cancer as a re-
sult of PSA screening. But screening picks up many cancers that will never become
fatal. This ‘overdiagnosis’ is thought to occur in ~40% of positive screens with
signifi cant risks from treatment including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunc-
tion, and IHD. This balance of risk versus benefi t means that population screening
for prostate cancer using PSA is not recommended. Despite this, any patient >50yrs
(or >45yrs if high risk) can request PSA testing in primary care. Interpret any PSA
result in conjunction with digital rectal examination and other risk factors.

Palliative care: principles and pain
You matter because you are you and you matter to the last moment of your life.
We will do all we can to help you, not only to die peacefully, but to live until you die.
Dame Cicely Saunders (1918–2005), founder of the modern hospice.
Palliative care is the active, holistic care of patients with advanced progressive ill-
ness. It combines management of pain and other symptoms, with the provision of
psychological, social, and spiritual support.
Palliative care is not just for the end of life and it is not just for patients with
cancer.
Palliative care should run in parallel with other medical treatments. Good symptom
control is important in any disease for improving quality of life and may even pro-
long survival.16 Take time to fi nd out exactly what is troubling your patient using a
problem-based approach. Consider:
• physical
• psychological
• spiritual
• social.
Remember, each person comes with a set of emotions, preconceptions, and a family
already attached. Most hospitals now have a dedicated palliative care team for
help and advice (including out of hours). Use their expertise.
Assessment of pain
Pain is one of the most feared sequelae of a terminal diagnosis and yet it is not
inevitable. However, pain is a complex phenomenon. While the aim of management
is for the patient to be pain free, this may not be achievable in all cases so do not
promise this.
Do not assume a cause: detailed history and examination are needed to under-
stand aetiology, which will guide subsequent treatment, eg pain from nerve infi l-
tration or local pressure may respond better to agents other than opioids. History
and examination are essential for all patients, including those at the end of life.
Evaluate severity, nature, functional defi cit, and psychological state as all of these
contribute to the symptom burden.
Management of pain
Aim to modify the underlying pathology where possible, eg radiotherapy, chemo-
therapy, surgery. Use analgesia to relieve background pain and provide additional
PRN doses for ‘breakthrough’ pain. Eff ective analgesia is possible in the majority of
patients by combining fi ve principles:
1 By the mouth—give orally whenever possible.
2 By the clock—give at fi xed intervals to off er continuous relief.
3 By the ladder—following the WHO stepwise approach (see fi g 13.5, p575).
4 For the individual—there are no standard doses for opioids, needs vary.
5 Attention to detail—communicate, set times carefully, warn of side-eff ects.
The WHO analgesic ladder
Increase and decrease the analgesia required according to the ‘steps’ on the ladder17
(fi g 13.5, p575):
1 Non-opioid, eg paracetamol.
2 Opioid for mild to moderate pain, eg codeine.
3 Opioid for moderate to severe pain, eg morphine, diamorphine, oxycodone.
• Persisting/increasing pain and side-eff ects inform the decision to step up and step
down. Take one step at a time to achieve pain relief without toxicity (except in new,
severe pain when step 2 may be omitted).
• Paracetamol (PO/PR/IV) at step 1 may have an opiate-sparing eff ect, and should be
continued at steps 2 and 3. Stop step 2 opioids if moving to step 3.
• Use laxatives and anti-emetics with strong opioids.
• Adjuvants which can be added at all steps include: NSAIDS, amitriptyline, pregaba-
lin, corticosteroids, nerve block, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),
radiotherapy.

Opioids
The amount of opioid required to relieve pain varies and should be titrated on an
individual basis. Oral morphine is 1st-line. If the oral route is unavailable, use mor-
phine or diamorphine SC (see table 11.5, and tables 11.6, 11.7, p536). Explanation and
regular review are important. Prescribe anti-emetics and laxatives for all patients.
Start low, go slow: For an opioid-naïve patient with moderate to severe pain, con-
sider oral morphine 5mg every 4 hours plus 5mg PRN (maximum hourly). Consider
a lower starting dose if elderly, BMI, or renal impairment. If pain is not controlled,
 dose by 30–50% every 24h.
Convert to modifi ed release: When pain is controlled, calculate the total daily
dose including PRN and divide into two 12h doses of a modifi ed-release preparation
(eg MST Continus® 12h). Transdermal preparations are available: seek expert help
for dose, check adhesion, and rotate site.
Use a PRN dose for breakthrough pain: 1/10th–1/6th of the total daily dose as an
immediate-release preparation, eg Oramorph® or Sevredol®.
Side-effects: Drowsiness, nausea/vomiting (usually  after 5 days), constipation,
dry mouth. If diffi culty tolerating morphine, or pain plus toxicity, consider an opi-
oid switch (eg oxycodone) and  dose by 25–30%.
Toxicity: Sedation, respiratory depression, visual hallucinations, myoclonic jerks,
delirium. Be alert: recognizing toxicity early usually means naloxone is avoided.
Monitor pulse oximetry, give oxygen if required. Consider : intracranial bleed,
renal failure.  Opioids and sedating drugs. Consider hydration. Seek expert help
if remains opioid-toxic or in pain. Naloxone is only indicated for life-threatening
respiratory depression (see p842). In patients on regular opiates it can precipitate
a pain crisis and potentially fatal acute withdrawal.18
Renal failure: Patients with renal impairment (eGFR <30) are at risk of toxicity
due to accumulation of renally excreted opioids and metabolites. Monitor closely.
Fentanyl, alfentanil, and buprenorphine have predominantly hepatic metabolism
—seek expert advice.
Concerns: Patients may shrink from using opioids. Misconceptions are common:
they are addictive, for the dying, if they use morphine now it will not work when
they really need it. Respiratory depression is very rare when opioids are correctly
titrated but opioids often get blamed when a patient deteriorates. Reassure pa-
tients that opioids are effective and safe when used appropriately.
Morphine-resistant pain: Seek expert help. Consider methadone, ketamine, and
adjuvants such as NSAIDS, steroids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, nerve blocks. If
neuropathic pain is suspected, try amitriptyline, pregabalin, or topical lidocaine.
Consider the eff ect of psychological and spiritual well-being on pain (see p535).
Rapid analgesia: Most PRN medication takes time to have an eff ect. If this is a
problem, seek expert help regarding rapid-release preparations (eg sublingual,
intranasal, or buccal fentanyl). Try to pre-empt times of high pain (eg dressing
changes) and give analgesia in advance.
Table 11.5 Opioid dose equivalents: conversions are not exact, potency can vary. If in doubt, use
a dose below your estimate. Practice is variable: always defer to local guidelines fi rst.
Relative potency 4h dose (mg) 24h dose (mg)
Morphine PO 1 5 30
Morphine SC 2 2.5 15
Diamorphine SC 3 1.5–2 10

Palliative care: other symptoms
Non-pain symptoms19 include:
Nausea and vomiting
Causes: Chemotherapy, constipation, hypercalcaemia, oral candidiasis, GI obstruc-
tion, drugs, severe pain, infection, renal failure.
Management: Treat reversible causes, eg laxatives for constipation, analgesia for
pain, hypercalcaemia (see p528), fl uconazole for oral candidiasis. Anti-emetic choice
should be based on the likely mechanism of nausea. Consider the site of anti-emetic
action, especially when using a combination of drugs. Oral absorption may be poor
so consider alternative routes (SC/IV/PR). Options include the following:
• Cyclizine 50mg/8h: antihistamine, anticholinergic, central action so good for in-
tracranial disorders.
• Metoclopramide 10–20mg/8h: blocks central chemoreceptor trigger zone, peripheral
prokinetic eff ects so good in gastroparesis, monitor for extra-pyramidal side-eff ects.
• Domperidone 10–20mg/8h PO: peripheral antidopaminergic so no dystonic eff ects.
• Haloperidol 1.5mg PO initially 1–2 times daily: dopamine antagonist, eff ective in
drug- or metabolically induced nausea, use lower doses IV/SC as twice as potent.
• Ondansetron 4–8mg/8h: serotonin antagonist, good for chemo/radiotherapy-relat-
ed nausea, may cause constipation.
• Levomepromazine 6.25mg, initially 1–2 times daily: broad spectrum, but can sedate,
may be very eff ective if fear/anxiety are contributing to symptoms.
Antisecretory drugs, such as hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide may be required
for patients with vomiting and bowel obstruction: seek expert advice.
Constipation
Causes: Very common side-eff ect of opioids. Better to prevent than treat so pre-
scribe laxatives for all patients starting opioids. Also hypercalcaemia (see p528),
dehydration, drugs, or intra-abdominal disease.
Treatment: Treat reversible causes. Good fl uid intake. Ensure privacy and access to
toilet. Medication options include the following:
• Stimulant (eg senna 2–4 tablets or bisacodyl 5–10mg) at night ± a softener (eg
sodium docusate 100mg BD).
• Osmotic laxative (eg macrogol).
• Rectal treatments: bisacodyl/glycerol suppositories, phosphate enema.
Breathlessness
Causes: Look for reversible causes including infection, eff usion, anaemia, arrhyth-
mia, thromboembolism. If stridor or signs of superior vena cava syndrome, treat
urgently (see p528).
Treatment: Treat reversible causes as appropriate. Consider thoracocentesis ± pleu-
rodesis for a pleural eff usion. Recurrent pleural eff usions may warrant a radiologi-
cally placed permanent drain (see p527). If the patient remains distressed, consider a
trial of low-dose opioids. These reduce respiratory drive and the sensation of breath-
lessness. If opioid-naive, start with 2.5mg of an immediate-release morphine every
4h. If already taking an opioid, use the appropriate breakthrough dose (see p533).
Benzodiazepines may help if associated anxiety, eg lorazepam 500mcg SL every 4–6h.
Oral problems
Causes: Poor oral hygiene, radiation, drugs (anticholinergics, chemotherapy, diuret-
ics), infection (candidiasis, herpes simplex).
Treatment: Oral candidiasis: topical miconazole, oral fl uconazole 50mg OD but check
for interactions (eg warfarin). Nystatin is often ineff ective and may exacerbate nau-
sea. Herpes simplex: oral gan/aciclovir. Good mouth care maintains comfort and
the ability to communicate. Maintain fl uid intake with frequent, small drinks. Sim-
ple measures are often  eff ective: sugar-free chewing gum, normal saline mouth-
washes, soft toothbrush. Products containing alcohol may sting. Salivary stimulants
(rather than substitutes) can be helpful for dry mouth, eg pilocarpine eye drops
4%, 3 drops in the fl oor of mouth QDS. Severe mucositis may need admission and
systemic opioids.

Insomnia
Causes: Terminally ill patients may experience physical and emotional exhaustion.
Often multifactorial. Poor sleep can increase symptom burden.
Treatment: Simple steps may make a big diff erence: appropriate room temperature,
darkness, and quiet during the night (request a side room for in-patients). Give pre-
scribed glucocorticoids in the morning. Avoid waking patients for late medications
and routine observations. Discuss and address psychosocial issues. In some cases
zopiclone or benzodiazepines may be used to help patients rest and re-establish
normal sleep–wake cycles (may exacerbate delirium).
Pruritus
Causes: Systemic disease (renal failure, hepatitis, polycythaemia), cancer-related
(cholestasis, lymphoma, leukaemia, hepatoma, myeloma, paraneoplastic), primary-
skin disease, drug reaction (opioids, SSRI, chemotherapy).
Treatment: Underlying causes where possible: cholestasis (biliary stenting, colestyr-
amine, sertraline, rifampicin), opioid-induced (antihistamine, opioid switch), para-
neoplastic (paroxetine). Topical emollients regularly and as a soap substitute. Avoid
topical antihistamines due to risk of contact dermatitis.
Venepuncture
Repeated venepuncture with the risk of painful extravasation and phlebitis may be
avoided by use of a central catheter (eg Hickman® tunnelled line or PICC). Problems:
infection, blockage (fl ush with 0.9% saline or dilute heparin every week), axillary
thrombosis, and line slippage.
Agitation See ‘Care in the last days of life’, p536.
Respiratory tract secretions See ‘Care in the last days of life’, p536.
Spiritual pain
‘The spiritual aspects of an illness concerns the human experiences of
sickness (or ‘dis-ease’) and the search for meaning within it.’
Peter W Speck
Spirituality is a means of experiencing life. It relates to the way in which people
understand and live their lives. It is comprised of elements including meaning,
purpose, and something greater than ‘self’. It is distinct from faith, which is a
religious experience, that may or may not be part of spirituality. Spiritual pain20,21
or suff ering is common when people are facing death. It can include feelings of
hopelessness, guilt, isolation, meaninglessness, and confusion. Consider:
• the past: painful memories, guilt
• the present: isolation, anger
• the future: fear, hopelessness.
Reminiscence helps address the past, provides context, and off ers recognition of
the patient as an individual. Anger should be acknowledged. Fear of the imagined
future may not change, but is potentially reduced through discussion. The nature
of hope may need to be modifi ed. If hope for a cure is inappropriate, it should not
be the main or only hope. Realistic hopes include discharge from hospital, seeing
family members happy, being remembered. Making a will, handing over respon-
sibilities, and dealing with unfi nished business facilitate control and may allow a
sense of completion.
Remember the whole person: history, coping mechanisms, state of well-being.
Elements such as these will alter how disease aff ects the patient and how the
patient responds to disease.
Companionship is essential in spiritual support. At times a doctor needs to mod-
ify their role to simply accompany the dying patient. This is manageable within
established professional boundaries and therapeutic. If you cannot do this, fi nd
someone who can: palliative care teams, Macmillan nurses, and chaplains (a listen-
ing ear for patients of all faiths and none) are all valuable resources.
Spiritual pain is exacerbated by physical symptoms. These must be addressed if
spiritual support is to be eff ective.

Palliative care: care in the last days of life
Once it is recognized that a patient is entering the fi nal days of their illness (see ‘Di-
agnosing dying’, p12), the focus of care should be the relief of distressing symptoms.22
An individualized care plan should be made and discussed with your patient, their
family, and relevant medical staff .
Continue to treat reversible problems as appropriate (eg urinary retention). Stop
observations and blood tests (unless you are going to act on them). Rationalize medi-
cations but keep any that provide ongoing symptom benefi t.
Prescribe as required subcutaneous end of life drugs. Prescribe PRN SC medica-
tions before they are needed, in anticipation of symptoms (see table 11.6).
Start a syringe driver when symptom control drugs are needed regularly
(see table 11.7). Practice is variable, some drugs may be used outside of licensed
indications. Always defer to local guidelines fi rst. If pain relief is insuffi cient, review
regular dose and recalculate the PRN requirement (1/10th–1/6th of 24h dose).
Anticipatory end of life medication
Table 11.6 Typical anticipatory medications.
Indication Drug Subcutaneous dose
Pain Morphine 2.5mg SC or 5mg PO (maximum every 1h)
If established on opioids use 1/10th–1/6th
of daily dose (see p533 and table 11.5)
Agitation + N&V Haloperidol 2.5mg SC (maximum every 1h)
Agitation + anxiety Midazolam 2.5mg SC (maximum every 1h)
N&V Levomepromazine 6.25mg SC TDS
Troublesome Glycopyrronium 200mcg SC every 4–8h
respiratory
secretions
Syringe drivers
Syringe drivers (table 11.7) allow a continuous SC infusion of drugs, avoiding re-
peated cannulation and injection when the oral route is no longer feasible. Some
medications should not be put in the same syringe—check interactions. Take into
account regular doses when calculating requirements. If in doubt, seek expert
help. Do not forget anticipatory prescribing in addition (table 11.6).

Manage agitation. Look for reversible causes (pain, dehydration, urinary retention).
Use an antipsychotic agent (eg haloperidol) to manage agitated delirium (see tables
11.6, 11.7). Try a benzodiazepine such as midazolam if there is a large element of anxi-
ety. Opioids should not be used to sedate a dying patient. Seek early advice from
palliative care if agitation is escalating or a signifi cant problem.
Manage excessive secretions. Noise is generated by turbulent air fl ow and pooling
of saliva in the hypopharynx. This may be more distressing for relatives and staff
than the patient. There is little evidence that pharmacological agents are benefi cial,
though they are commonly used. Repositioning and intermittent suctioning may
help. If you think the patient is distressed, consider a trial of an antisecretory drug
(glycopyrronium or hyoscine butylbromide: see tables 11.6, 11.7).
Hydration. Many patients approaching the end of life are unable to eat/drink or
have a very poor appetite for food/fl uid. Helping to take sips and good mouth care
may suffi ce. Fluid via non-oral routes (NG, SC, IV) is given for symptomatic benefi t; the
eff ect on survival is unknown. Any potential benefi t must be weighed against the
risk of symptomatic fl uid overload. Discuss this with patients and families, explain-
ing the pros and cons of hydration and the uncertainty of the eff ect of hydration on
survival:23 relatives may assume the patient is dying faster because of dehydration or
that they will be suff ering with thirst. Make decisions about giving fl uids on a case-
by-case basis. Review a patient’s hydration status at least daily.
Plan for death. Ensure that a ‘Do not attempt resuscitation’ or ‘Allow natural death’,
order has been made. Discuss this with the patient (where appropriate), their family,
and/or others of importance to them. Document everything clearly. Do they want
to die at home? This can usually be arranged at very short notice with help from
district nursing teams and community palliative care. Discuss transfer to a hospice
or nursing home if appropriate.
Respond to changes in the clinical situation. Patients who are thought to be at
the end of their life occasionally improve. Be alert to signs of improvement, and be
prepared to switch back to active treatment when appropriate.
Communicate.23 The importance of clear and regular written and verbal commu-
nication with dying patients and their families cannot be overemphasized. Find
out what is important to your patient. How much information do they know and
want to know about their situation and prognosis? Be sensitive to social, religious,
and cultural issues.
On wanting to die
Physician-assisted suicide is the provision of drugs by a doctor for self-adminis-
tration by a person to terminate their own life. This is distinct from euthanasia
where a doctor administers the lethal drug. There have been repeated attempts
to introduce physician-assisted dying (physician-assisted suicide only of the ter-
minally ill) into UK law, but all have been rejected by Parliament.
Consider autonomy. Should competent patients have the right to determine
their death, especially if their situation is unbearable, without prospect of im-
provement? It is a powerful argument. But bearable is subjective and prognosis is
an inexact science. And benefi cence is divided: is it merciful, or is it abandonment,
to end suff ering through death? And what of consent? Consent is key. Yet consent
is complex. Could a legal process help? Not without a unique understanding of
each patient and the means by which they experience life. A combination of law
and medicine may off er false comfort without full accountability by either. Protec-
tion for the vulnerable is a valid concern for doctors and society.
Requests to hasten death are complex and include personal, psychological, spir-
itual, social, cultural, and demographic factors. ~10% of terminally ill patients will
consider euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide. These wishes may or may not
be fi xed, with ~50% of patients changing their mind within 6 months. Discuss this.
Ask your patient how they feel today and what they are afraid of feeling tomor-
row. Listen. Answer questions. Off er palliative care. Palliative care is never futile.
A wish to die is associated with a need for information, reassurance, and compe-
tence in symptom control. Provide these, or fi nd someone who can.

A rapidly advancing speciality
Rheumatology originates from the Greek word ‘rheuma’ meaning that which
‘fl ows as a river or stream’. The British Society of Rheumatology defi nes rheuma-
tology as a ‘multidisciplinary branch of medicine that deals with the investigation,
diagnosis and management of patients with arthritis and other musculoskeletal
conditions...incorporating over 200 disorders aff ecting joints, bones, muscles and
soft tissues, including infl ammatory arthritis and other systemic autoimmune dis-
orders, vasculitis, soft tissue conditions, spinal pain and metabolic bone disease’.
Rheumatological diseases aff ect over 10 million UK adults and 12 000 children. Re-
cent advances owe largely to new discoveries about the immunology of these
disorders and the discovery of biologic DMARDS.

The rheumatological history
In the assessment of an arthritic presentation, pay particular attention to the dis-
tribution of joint involvement (including spine) and the presence of symmetry. Also
look for disruption of joint anatomy, limitation of movement (by pain or contracture),
joint eff usions and peri-articular involvement (see p540 for a fuller assessment). Ask
about, and examine for, extra-articular features: skin and nail (see p76) involvement
(include scalp, hairline, umbilicus, genitalia, and natal cleft—psoriasis can easily be
missed); eye signs (see p560); lungs (eg fi brosis) (see p198); kidneys (see p314); heart;
GI (eg mouth ulcers, diarrhoea); GU (eg urethritis, genital ulcers); and CNS.
Three screening questions for musculoskeletal disease
1 Are you free of any pain or stiff ness in your joints, muscles, or back?
2 Can you dress yourself without too much diffi culty?
3 Can you manage walking up and down stairs?
If yes to all three, serious infl ammatory muscle/joint disease is unlikely.
Presenting symptoms: Related diseases:
• Pattern of involved joints. • Crohn’s/UC (in ank yl osing spondylitis),
• Symmetry (or not). preceding infections, psoriasis.

Exclude septic arthritis in any acutely infl amed joint, as it can destroy a joint
in under 24h (p544). Infl ammation may be less overt if immunocompromised (eg
from the many immunosuppressive drugs used in rheumatological conditions) or
if there is underlying joint disease. Joint aspiration (p541) is the key investigation,
and if you are unable to do it, fi nd someone who can.

Assessing the locomotor system
This aims to screen for rheumatological conditions primarily aff ecting mobility (as a
consequence of underlying joint disease). It is based on the GALS locomotor screen
(Gait, Arms, Legs, Spine). 1
Essence ‘Look, feel, and move’ (active and passive). If a joint looks normal to you,
feels normal to the patient, and has full range of movement, it usua lly is normal.
Make sure the patient is comfortable, and obtain their consent before examination.
The GALS screening examination should be done in light underwear.
Spine: Observe from behind: is muscle bulk normal (buttocks, shoulders)? Is the
spine straight? Are paraspinal muscles symmetrical? Any swellings/deformities?
Observe from the side: is cervical and lumbar lordosis normal? Any kyphosis?
‘Touch your toes, please’: is lumbar spine fl exion normal, eg Schober’s test?1 Observe
from in front: ‘Tilt your head’ (without moving the shoulders)—tests lateral neck
fl exion. Palpate for typical fi bromyalgia tender points (see p558).
Arms: ‘Try putting your hands behind your head’—tests functional shoulder move-
ment. ‘Arms out straight’—tests elbow extension and forearm supination/prona-
tion. Examine the hands: any deformity (fi g 12.2), wasting, or swellings? Squeeze
across 2nd–5th metacarpophalangeal joints. Pain may denote joint or tendon syno-
vitis. ‘Put your index fi nger on your thumb’—tests pincer grip. Assess dexterity, eg
fastening a button or picking up a coin.
Legs: Observe legs: normal quadriceps bulk? Any swelling or deformity? With pa-
tient lying supine: any leg length discrepancy? Internally/externally rotate each hip
in fl exion. Passively fl ex knee and hip to the full extent. Is movement limited? Any
crepitus? Find any knee effusion using the patella tap test. If there is fl uid, consider
aspirating and testing for crystals or infection. With patient standing: observe feet:
any deformity? Are arches high or fl at? Any callosities? These may indicate an ab-
normal gait of some chronicity. Squeeze across metatarsophalangeal joints: see as
for arms. Also: although not in the GALS system, palpate the heel and Achilles tendon
to identify plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis often associated with seronega-
tive rheumatological conditions. Examine the patient’s shoes for signs of uneven wear.
Gait: Observe walking: is the gait smooth? Good arm swing? Stride length OK? Nor-
mal heel strike and toe off ? Can they turn quickly?
Range of joint movement Is noted in degrees, with anatomical position being the
neutral position—eg elbow fl exion 0°–150° normally, but with fi xed fl exion and lim-
ited movement, range may be reduced to 30°–90°. A valgus deformity deviates later-
ally (away from the mid-line, fi g 12.3); a varus deformity points towards the mid-line.

1 Schober’s test: make a mark on the lumbar spine at the level of the posterior iliac spine. Measure out
a line from 5cm below to 10cm above the mark. Ask to bend forward as far as they can. If the line does
not lengthen by at least 5cm in fl exion, there is reduced lumbar fl exion, eg in ankylosing spondylitis.

Some important rheumatological investigations
Joint aspiration: The most important investigation in any monoarthritic pres-
entation (table 12.2, see also OHCS p706). Send synovial fl uid for urgent white cell
count, Gram stain, polarized light microscopy (for crystals, p548), and culture. The
risk of inducing septic arthritis, using sterile precautions, is <1:10 000. 2 Look for
blood,3 pus, and crystals (gout or CPPD crystal arthropathy; p548). Do not at-
tempt joint aspiration through infl amed and potentially infected skin (eg through
a psoriatic plaque or overlying cellulitis).

Blood tests: FBC, ESR, urate, U&E, CRP. Blood culture for septic arthritis. Consider
rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, ANA, other auto antibodies (p553), and HLA B27 (p551)
—as guided by presentation. Consider causes of reactive arthritis (p551), eg viral
serology, urine chlamydia PCR, hepatitis and HIV serology if risk factors are present.
Radiology: Look for erosions, calcifi cation, widening or loss of joint space, chang-
es in underlying bone of aff ected joints (eg periarticular osteopenia, sclerotic ar-
eas, osteophytes). Characteristic X-ray features for various arthritides are shown
in fi gs 12.4–12.6. Irregularity of the sacroiliac joints is seen in spondyloarthritis.
Ultrasound and MRI are more sensitive in identifying eff usions, synovitis, enthesitis
and infection than plain radiographs—discuss further investigations with a radi-
ologist. Do a CXR for RA, vasculitis, TB, and sarcoid.

Back pain
Back pain is very common, and often self-limiting, but be alert to sinister causes, ie
malignancy, infection, or infl ammatory causes.
Red fl ags for sinister causes of back pain
Aged <20yrs or >55yrs old Thoracic back pain
Acute onset in elderly people Morning stiff ness
Constant or progressive pain Bilateral or alternating leg pain
Nocturnal pain Neurological disturbance (incl. sciatica)
Worse pain on being supine Sphincter disturbance
Fever, night sweats, weight loss Current or recent infection
History of malignancy Immunosuppression, eg steroids/HIV
Abdominal mass Leg claudication or exercise-related leg
weakness/numbness (spinal stenosis).
Examination
1 With the patient standing, gauge the extent and smoothness of lumbar forward/
lateral fl exion and extension (see p540).
2 Test for sacroiliitis: palpate posteriorly down the length of the spine, including
over spinous processes, paraspinal muscles, and the sacroiliac joints; examining
for tenderness.
3 Neurological defi cits (see BOX): test lower limb sensation, power, and deep tendon
and plantar refl exes. Digital rectal examination for perianal tone and sensation.
4 Examine for nerve root pain (table 12.3): this is distributed in relevant dermato-
mes, and is worsened by coughing or bending forward. Straight leg test (L4, L5,
S1): positive if raising the leg with the knee extended causes pain below the knee,
which increases on foot dorsifl exion (Lasègue’s sign). It suggests irritation to the
sciatic nerve. The main cause is lumbar disc prolapse. Also femoral stretch test
(L2–L4): pain in front of thigh on lifting the hip into extension with the patient lying
face downwards and the knee fl exed.
5 Signs of generalized disease—eg malignancy. Examine other systems (eg abdo-
men) as pain may be referred.
Causes Age determines the most likely causes:
15–30yrs: Prolapsed disc, trauma, fractures, ankylosing spondylitis (AS; p550),
spondylolisthesis (a forward shift of one vertebra over another, which is
congenital or due to trauma), pregnancy.
30–50yrs: Degenerative spinal disease, prolapsed disc, malignancy (primary or
secondary from lung, breast, prostate, thyroid, or kidney ca).
>50yrs: Degenerative, osteoporotic vertebral collapse, Paget’s (see p685), malig-
nancy, myeloma (see p368), spinal stenosis.
Rarer: Cauda equina tumours, psoas abscess, spinal infection (eg discitis, usually staphy-
lococcal but also Proteus, E. coli, S. typhi, and TB—there are often no systemic signs).
Investigations Arrange relevant tests if you suspect a specifi c cause, or if red
fl ag symptoms: FBC, ESR, and CRP (myeloma, infection, tumour), U&E, ALP (Paget’s),
serum/urine electrophoresis (myeloma), PSA. X-rays—imaging may not always
be necessary but can exclude bony abnormalities and fractures. Correlation be-
tween radiographic abnormalities and clinical features can be poor. MRI is the
image of choice and can detect disc prolapse, cord compression (fi g 12.7), can-
cer, infection, or infl ammation (eg sacroiliitis).
Management Urgent neurosurgical referral if any neurological defi cit (see BOX).
Keep the diagnosis under review. For non-specifi c back pain, focus on education
and self-management. Advise patients to continue normal activites and be ac-
tive. Regular paracetamol ± NSAIDS ± codeine. Consider low-dose amitriptyline/du-
loxetine if these fail (not SSRIS for pain). Off er physiotherapy, acupuncture, or an
exercise programme if not improving.4 Address psychosocial issues, which may
predispose to developing chronic pain and disability (see p559). Referral to pain
clinic or surgical options for patients with intractable symptoms.

Neurosurgical emergencies
Acute cauda equina compression Alternating or bilateral root pain in legs, sad-
dle anaesthesia (perianal), loss of anal tone on PR, bladder ± bowel incontinence.
Acute cord compression Bilateral pain, LMN signs (p446) at level of compression,
UMN and sensory loss below, sphincter disturbance.
Immediate urgent treatment prevents irreversible loss, eg laminectomy for disc
protrusions, radiotherapy for tumours, decompression for abscesses.
Causes (same for both): bony metastasis (look for missing pedicle on X-ray), large
disc protrusion, myeloma, cord or paraspinal tumour, TB (p392), abscess.

Osteoarthritis (OA)
Osteoarthritis is the most common joint condition worldwide, with a clinically signif-
icant impact on >10% of persons aged >60 years.5 It is usually primary (generalized),
but may be secondary to joint disease or other conditions (eg haemochromatosis,
obesity, occupational).
Signs and symptoms Localized disease (often knee or hip): Pain and crepitus on
movement, with background ache at rest. Worse with prolonged activity. Joints may
‘gel’ (brief stiff ness after rest, usually 10–15 minutes or so). Joints may feel unstable,
with a perceived lack of power due to pain. Generalized disease: ‘Nodal OA’ (typi-
cally DIP, PIP, CMC joints, and knees in post-menopausal females). There may be joint
tenderness, derangement and bony swelling (Heberden’s at DIP and Bouchard’s at
PIP), reduced range of movement and mild synovitis. Assess eff ect of symptoms on
occupation, family duties, hobbies, and lifestyle expectations.
Tests Plain radiographs show: Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subarticular sclerosis
and Subchondral cysts (fi g 12.4 p541). CRP may be slightly elevated.6
Management Core treatments: Exercise to improve local muscle strength and
general aerobic fi tness (irrespective of age, severity, or comorbidity). Weight loss
if overweight.7 Analgesia: Regular paracetamol ± topical NSAIDS. If ineff ective use
codeine or short-term oral NSAID (+PPI)—see BOX. Topical capsaicin (derived from
chillies) may help. Intra-articular steroid injections temporarily relieve pain in severe
sym ptoms. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections (viscosupplementation) are
not NICE approved8 Glucosamine and chondroitin products are not recommended,
although patients may try them if they wish (can be bought over the counter). Non-
pharmacological: Use a multidisciplinary approach, including physiotherapists and
occupational therapists. Try heat or cold packs at the site of pain, walking aids,
stretching/manipulation or TENS. Surgery: Joint replacement (hips, or knees) is the
best way to deal with severe OA that has a substantial impact on quality of life.
Septic arthritis
Consider septic arthritis in any acutely infl amed joint, as it can destroy a joint in
under 24h and has a mortaility rate up to 11%. Infl ammation may be less overt if im-
munocompromised (eg from medication) or if there is underlying joint disease. The
knee is aff ected in >50% cases.
Risk factors Pre-existing joint disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis); diabetes
mellitus, immunosuppression, chronic renal failure, recent joint surgery, prosthetic
joints (where infection is particularly diffi cult to treat), IV drug abuse, age >80yrs.9
Investigations Urgent joint aspiration for synovial fl uid microscopy and culture is
the key investigation (p541), as plain radiographs and CRP may be normal. The main
diff erential diagnoses are the crystal arthropathies (p548). Blood cultures are es-
sential (prior to antibiotics).
Ask yourself ‘How did the organism get there?’ Is there immuno suppression, or
another focus of infection, eg from indwelling IV lines, infected skin, or pneumonia
(present in up to 50% of those with pneumococcal arthritis)?10
Treatment If in doubt start empirical IV antibiotics (after aspiration) until sensi-
tivities are known. Common causative organisms are Staph. aureus, streptococci,
Neisseria gonococcus, and Gram Ωve bacilli. Follow local guidelines for antibiotic
choice and contact microbiology for advice for all complex cases/immunosup-
pressed patients (eg HIV). Consider fl ucloxacillin 2g QDS IV (clindamycin if penicillin
allergic); Vancomycin IV plus 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin, eg cefuroxime if
MRSA risk; 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin if Gram Ωve organisms suspected.11
For suspected gonococcus or meningococcus, consider ceftriaxone. Antibiotics are
required for a prolonged period, conventionally ~2 weeks IV, then if patient improv-
ing 2–4 weeks PO.12 Consider orthopaedic review for arthrocentesis, washout, and
debridement; always urgently refer patients with prosthetic joint involvement.

Prescribing NSAIDS: benefi t vs risk profi ling
Around 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID, but there is considerable vari-
ation in response and tolerance—if one isn’t eff ective, try another. Mainly act as
analgesics rather than modifying the disease process per se.
NSAIDs caused ~2000 UK deaths in 2011.13 Individualized risk: benefi t analysis for
each patient (including indication, dose, proposed duration of use, and comorbid-
ity) is crucial and needs careful and experienced thought. Follow local recommen-
dations and national guidelines where available.
NSAID side effects: The main serious side eff ects are GI bleeding (and ulcers and
perforation), cardiovascular events (MI and stroke), and renal injury. The risks are
dose related, starting with the fi rst dose, so always aim to use the lowest possible
dose for the shortest period of time. Risks increase considerably with age, polyp-
harmacy, history of peptic ulcers, and renal impairment.
GI side effects: NICE recommends co-prescription of PPI for any patient aged >45
years, and those with other risk factors for GI bleeding. Drug interactions can
increase bleeding risks—avoid concomitant prescribing of anticoagulants, anti-
platelet agents, SSRI, spironolactone, steroids, and bisphosphonates. Coxibs are
slightly lower risk than non-selective NSAIDs.
Cardiovascular side effects: NSAIDS—all are associated with a small increased
risk of MI and stroke (independent of cardiovascular risk factor or duration of
use).14 Risks are higher in those with concomitant IHD risk factors, eg diabetes and
hypertension. Coxibs and diclofenac are higher risk, and are contraindicated if
prior history of MI, PVD, stroke, or heart failure. Naproxen has the lowest cardiovas-
cular risk. Low-dose celecoxib may be considered for patients on low-dose aspirin
(if NSAID is required) as it does not interact with it.15
Renal risks: Higher for patients already on diuretics, ACE, or ARB. Risks are also
increased in the elderly, those with hypertension and T2DM. Overall, naproxen
(<1000mg/day) or ibuprofen (<1200mg/day) plus PPI may be the safest options.
Alternatives to NSAIDs: Paracetamol, topical NSAIDs, opioids. Strengthening exer-
cises may be more benefi cial than mild oral analgesics.
Counselling patients: Make sure patients understand about the drugs they are
taking: bleeding is more common in those who know less about their drugs.16
• Only to take NSAIDs when they need them.
• Stop NSAIDs and seek urgent medical review if they develop abdominal pain or
any symptoms of GI bleeding (eg report black stools ± faints immediately).
• Do not mix prescription NSAIDs with over-the-counter formulations: mixing
NSAIDS can increase risks 20-fold.
• Smoking and alcohol increase risk profi le of NSAIDs.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
RA is a chronic systemic infl ammatory disease, characterized by a symmetrical, de-
forming, peripheral polyarthritis. It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by
2–3 fold. Epidemiology Prevalence is ~1% ( in smokers). : >2:1. Peak onset: 5th–
6th decade. HLA DR4/DR1 linked (associated with severity).
Presentation Typically: Symmetrical swollen, painful, and stiff small joints of hands
and feet, worse in the morning. This can fl uctuate and larger joints may become in-
volved. Less common presentations: •Sudden onset, widespread arthritis. •Recur-
ring mono/polyarthritis of various joints (palindromic RA).2 •Persistent monoarthritis
(knee, shoulder, or hip). •Systemic illness with extra-articular symptoms, eg fa tigue,
fever, weight loss, pericarditis, and pleurisy, but initially few joint problems (com-
moner in ). •Polymyalgic onset—vague limb girdle aches. •Recurrent soft tissue
problems (eg frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain’s tenosynovitis).
Signs Early: (Infl ammation, no joint damage.) Swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints
(often symmetrical). Look for tenosynovitis or bursitis. Later: (Joint damage, de-
formity.) Ulnar deviation and subluxation of the wrist and fi ngers. Boutonnière and
swan-neck deformities of fi ngers (fi g 12.2 on p540) or Z-deformity of thumbs occur.
Hand extensor tendons may rupture. Foot changes are similar. Larger joints can be
involved. Atlanto-axial joint subluxation may threaten the spinal cord (rare).
Extra-articular manifestations Aff ect ~40% of RA patients. Nodules:
Elbows, lungs, cardiac, CNS, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis. Lungs: Pleural dis-
ease, interstitial fi brosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia. Car-
diac: IHD, pericarditis, pericardial eff usion; carpal tunnel syndrome; peripheral
neuropathy; splenomegaly (seen in 5%; only 1% have Felty’s syndrome: RA + sple-
nomegaly + neutropenia, see p698). Eye: Episcleritis, scleritis, scleromalacia,
keratoconjunctivitis sicca (p560); osteoporosis; amyloidosis is rare (p370).17,18
Investigations Rheumatoid factor (RhF) is positive in ~70% (p553). High titres
associated with severe disease, erosions, and extra-articular disease. Anticyclic
citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are highly specifi c (~98%) for RA with
a reasonable sensitivity (70–80%); they may also predict disease progression.19
Anaemia of chronic disease, platelets, ESR, CRP. X-rays show soft tissue swell-
ing, juxta-articular osteopenia and joint space. Later there may be bony erosions,
subluxation, or complete carpal destruction (see fi g 12.5 on p541). Ultrasound and
MRI can identify synovitis more accurately, and have greater sensitivity in detecting
bone erosions than conventional X-rays.20
Diagnostic criteria See table 12.4.
Management Refer early to a rheumatologist (before irreversible destruction).
• Disease activity is measured using the DAS28.3 Treatment should be escalated until
satisfactory control is achieved: ‘treat to target’.
• Early use of DMARDS and biological agents improves long-term outcomes (see BOX
‘Infl uencing biological events in RA’).
• Steroids rapidly reduce symptoms and infl ammation. Avoid starting unless appro-
priately experienced. Useful for acute exacerbations, eg IM depot methylpredniso-
lone 80–120mg. Intra-articular steroids have a rapid but short-term eff ect (OHCS
pp706–9). Oral steroids (eg prednisolone 7.5mg/d) may control diffi cult symptoms,
but side eff ects preclude routine long-term use.
• NSAIDS (see p545) are good for symptom relief, but have no eff ect on disease pro-
gression. Paracetamol and weak opiates are rarely eff ective.
• Off er specialist physio- and occupational therapy, eg for aids and splints.
• Surgery may relieve pain, improve function, and prevent deformity.
• There is risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, as atherosclerosis
is accelerated in RA.21 Manage risk factors (p93). Smoking also  symptoms of RA.
2 In rheumatological palindromes, arthritis lasting hours or days runs to and fro, visiting and revisiting
three or more sites, typically knees, wrists, and MCP joints. It may presage RA, SLE, Whipple’s, or Behçet’s
disease. Remissions are (initially) complete, leaving no radiological mark.
3 28-joint Disease Activity Score—assesses tenderness and swelling at 28 joints (MCPS, PIPS, wrists,
elbows, shoulders, knees), ESR/CRP, and patient’s self-reported symptom severity.

Quality of life
Depression, disability, and pain are important quality of life predictors. Be mindful
of the impact of disease on relationships, work, and hobbies and acknowledge and
explore this with your patients. Patients may wish to investigate complementary
therapies and may fi nd benefi t from support groups .
Infl uencing biological events in RA
The chief biological event is infl ammation. Over-produced cytokines and cellular
processes erode cartilage and bone, and produce the systemic eff ects seen in RA.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) are 1st line and should ideally
be started within 3 months of persistent symptoms. They can take 6–12 weeks for
symptomatic benefi t. Best results are often achieved with a combination of meth-
otrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.23 Lefl unomide is another option.
Immunosuppression is a potentially fatal SE of treatment (especially in combi-
nation with methotrexate) which can result in pancytopenia, susceptibility to
infection (including atypical organisms), and neutropenic sepsis (p352). Regular
FBC, LFT monitoring.24
Other SE • Methotrexate—pneumonitis (pre treatment CXR), oral ulcers, hepa-
totoxicity, teratogenic. • Sulfasalazine—rash, sperm count, oral ulcers, GI upset.
• Lefl unomide—teratogenicity ( and ), oral ulcers, BP, hepatotoxicity. • Hydroxy-
chloroquine—can cause retinopathy; pre treatment and annual eye screen required.
Biological agents and NICE guidance Initiated by specialists, for patients with
active disease despite adequate trial of at least 2 DMARDS. Pre treatment screening
for TB, hepatitis B/C, HIV essential.
1 TNF inhibitors: Eg infl iximab (p265), etanercept, adalimumab, are approved by
NICE as 1st-line agents. Where methotrexate is contraindicated, can be used as
monotherapy. Clinical response can be striking, with improved function and health
outcomes, although response may be inadequate/unsustained.25
2 B-cell depletion: Eg rituximab, used in combination with methotrexate and ap-
proved by NICE for severe active RA where DMARDS and a TNF blocker have failed.26
3 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition: Eg tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker), approved by NICE
in combination with methotrexate where TNF blocker has failed (or is contraindi-
cated).27 Monitor for hypercholesterolaemia.
4 Inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation: Eg abatacept—licensed for active RA where
patients have not responded to DMARDS or TNF blocker.28
Side eff ects of biological agents Serious infection, reactivation of TB ( screen
and consider prophylaxis) and hepatitis B; worsening heart failure; hypersensitiv-
ity; injection-site reactions and blood disorders. ANA and reversible SLE-type illness
may evolve. Data suggests there is no increased risk of solid organ tumours but
skin cancers may be more common.29 TNF inhibitors do not appear to be associated
with a further increase in the already elevated lymphoma occurrence in RA.30

Crystal arthropathies: gout
Gout31 typically presents with an acute monoarthropathy with severe joint infl am-
mation (fi g 12.8). >50% occur at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe (fi g
12.12) (podagra). Other common joints are the ankle, foot, small joints of the hand,
wrist, elbow, or knee. It can be polyarticular. It is caused by deposition of mono-
sodium urate crystals in and near joints. Attacks may be precipitated by trauma,
surgery, starvation, infection, or diuretics. It is associated with raised plasma urate.
In the long term, urate deposits (= tophi, eg in pinna, tendons, joints; see fi g 12.9) and
renal disease (stones, interstitial nephritis) may occur. Prevalence: ~1%.  :  ≈ 4 : 1.
Diff erential diagnoses Exclude septic arthritis in any acute monoarthropathy
(p544). Then consider reactive arthritis, haemarthrosis, CPPD (see following topic) and
palindromic RA (p546).
Risk factors Reduced urate excretion: Elderly, men, post-menopausal females,
impaired renal function, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diuretics, antihyper-
tensives, aspirin. Excess urate production: Dietary (alcohol, sweeteners, red meat,
seafood), genetic disorders, myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis,
tumour-lysis syndrome, drugs (eg alcohol, warfarin, cytotoxics). Associations: Car-
diovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (see
p680).31 Gout is an independent risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular and
renal disease. Screen for and treat CKD, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes.
Investigations Polarized light microscopy of synovial fl uid shows negatively bi-
refringent urate crystals (fi g 12.10). Serum urate (SUA) is usually raised but may be
normal.32 Radiographs show only soft-tissue swelling in the early stages. Later, well-
defi ned ‘punched out’ erosions are seen in juxta-articular bone (see fi g 12.6 on p541).
There is no sclerotic reaction, and joint spaces are preserved until late.
Treatment of acute gout High-dose NSAID (see BOX, p545) or if CI use colchicine
(500mcg BD) which is eff ective but slower to work (BNF states max 6mg per course
although rheumatologists will often use more).33 NB: in renal impairment, NSAIDS and
colchicine are problematic. Steroids (oral, IM, or intra-articular) may also be used.34
Rest and elevate joint. Ice packs and ‘bed cages’ can be eff ective.
Prevention Lose weight, avoid prolonged fasts, alcohol excess, purine-rich meats,
and low-dose aspirin. Prophylaxis: Start if >1 attack in 12 months, tophi, or renal
stones. The aim is to  attacks and prevent damage caused by crystal deposition. Use
allopurinol and titrate from 100mg/24h, increasing every 4 weeks until plasma urate
<0.3mmol/L (max 300mg/8h). SE: rash, fever, WCC. Allopurinol may trigger an attack
so wait 3 weeks after an acute episode, and cover with regular NSAID (for up to 6
weeks) or colchicine (0.5mg/12h PO for up to 6 months). Avoid stopping allopurinol in
acute attacks once established. Febuxostat (80mg/24h) is an alternative if allopuri-
nol is CI or not tolerated. It  uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase (SE: LFTS) and
is more eff ective at reducing serum urate than allopurinol (number of acute attacks
the same).35 Uricosuric drugs  urate excretion.
Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD)
• Acute CPPD crystal arthritis Acute monoarthropathy usually of larger joints in
elderly. Usually spontaneous but can be provoked by illness, surgery, or trauma.
• Chronic CPPD Infl ammatory RA-like (symmetrical) polyarthritis and synovitis.
• Osteoarthritis with CPPD chronic polyarticular osteoarthritis with superimposed
acute CPP attacks.
Risk factors Old age, hyperparathyroidism (see p222), haemochromatosis (see p288),
hypophosphataemia (see p679). Tests Polarized light microscopy of synovial fl uid
shows weakly positively birefringent crystals (fi g 12.11). It is associated with soft tis-
sue calcium deposition on x-ray. Management Acute attacks: cool packs, rest, aspira-
tion, and intra-articular steroids. NSAIDS (+PPI) ± colchicine 0.5–1.0mg/24h (used with
caution) may prevent acute attacks. Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine may be
considered for chronic CPP infl ammatory arthritis.36

Spondyloarthritides
The spondyloarthropathies (SpA) are a group of related chronic infl ammatory condi-
tions. They tend to, although not always, aff ect the axial skeleton with shared clinical
features:
1 Seronegativity (= rheumatoid factor Ωve).
2 HLA B27 association—see BOX.
3 ‘Axial arthritis’: pathology in spine (spondylo-) and sacroiliac joints.
4 Asymmetrical large-joint oligoarthritis (ie< 5 joints) or monoarthritis.
5 Enthesitis: infl ammation of the site of insertion of tendon or ligament into bone,
eg plantar fasci itis, Achilles tendonitis, costochondritis.
6 Dactylitis: infl ammation of an entire digit (‘sausage digit’), due to soft tissue
oedema, and tenosynovial and joint infl ammation.
7 Extra-articular manifestations: eg iritis (anterior uveitis), psoriaform rashes
(psoriatic arthritis), oral ulcers, aortic valve incompetence, infl ammatory bowel
disease.
NB: BehÇet’s syndrome (p694) can also present with uveitis, skin lesions, and a rthritis
and is not always associated with gross oral or genital ulcerations.
1 Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) A chronic infl ammatory disease of the spine and
sacroiliac joints, of unknown aetiology (likely strong genetic/environmental in-
terplay). Prevalence: 0.25–1%. Men present earlier: : ~6:1 at 16yrs old, and
~2:1 at 30yrs old. ~90% are HLA B27 +ve (see BOX). Symptoms and signs: The
typical patient is a man <30yrs old with gradual onset of low back pain,worse
during the night with spinal morning stiff ness relieved by exercise. Pain radi-
ates from sacroiliac joints to hips/buttocks, and usually improves towards the
end of the day. There is progressive loss of spinal movement (all directions)—
hence thoracic expansion. See pp540–2 for tests of spine fl exion and sacroiliitis.
The disease course is variable; a few progress to kyphosis, neck hyperextension
(question-mark posture; fi g 12.13), and spino-cranial ankylosis. Other features
include enthesitis (see BOX), especially Achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, at the
tibial and ischial tuberosities, and at the iliac crests. Anterior mechanical chest
pain due to costochondritis and fatigue may feature. Acute iritis occurs in ~⅓
of patients and may lead to blindness if untreated (but may also have occurred
many years before, so enquire directly). AS is also associated with osteoporosis
(up to 60%), aortic valve incompetence (<3%), and pulmonary apical fi brosis.
Tests: Diagnosis is clinical, supported by imaging.4 MRI allows detection of active
infl ammation (bone marrow oedema) as well as destructive changes such as
erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis. X-rays can show SI joint space narrowing or
widening, sclerosis, erosions, and ankylosis/fusion. Vertebral syndesmophytes
are characteristic (often T11–L1 initially): bony proliferations due to enthesitis
between ligaments and vertebrae. These fuse with the vertebral body above,
causing ankylosis. In later stages, calcifi cation of ligaments with ankylosis lead
to a ‘bamboo spine’ appearance. Also: FBC (normocytic anaemia), ESR, CRP, HLA
B27 +ve (+ve in 90–95% of cases but only 5% of patients HLA B27 +ve have AS).
Management: Exercise, not rest, for backache, including intense exercise regi-
mens to maintain posture and mobility—ideally with a specialist physiotherapist.
NSAIDS usually relieve symptoms within 48h, and may slow radiographic progres-
sion.37 TNF BLOCKERS (eg etanercept, adalimumab) are indicated in severe ac-
tive AS.38 Local steroid injections provide temporary relief. Surgery includes hip
replacement to improve pain and mobility if the hips are involved, and rarely spinal
osteotomy. There is risk of osteoporotic spinal fractures (consider bisphospho-
nates). Prognosis: There is not always a clear relationship between the activity
of arthritis and severity of underlying infl ammation (as for all the spondyloarth-
ritides). Prognosis is worse if ESR >30; onset <16yrs; early hip involvement or poor
response to NSAIDS.39
2 Enteric arthropathy Associations: Infl ammatory bowel disease, GI bypass,
coeliac and Whipple’s disease (p716). Arthropathy often improves with the treat-
ment of bowel symptoms (beware NSAIDS). Use DMARDS for resistant cases.
4 Sacroiliitis on imaging plus ≥1 SpA feature or HLA B27 positive plus ≥2 SpA features.

3 Psoriatic arthritis (OHCS p594.) Occurs in 10–40% with psoriasis and can present
before skin changes. Patterns are: •symmetrical polyarthritis (like RA) •DIP joints
•asymmetrical oligoarthritis •spinal (similar to AS) •psoriatic arthritis mutilans
(rare, ~3%, severe deformity). Radiology: Erosive changes, with ‘pencil-in-cup’
deformity in severe cases. Associated with nail changes in 80%, synovitis (dac-
tylitis), acneiform rashes and palmo-plantar pustulosis. Management: NSAIDS,
sulfasalazine, methotrexate. Anti-TNF agents are also eff ective.
4 Reactive arthritis A condition in which arthritis and other clinical manifesta-
tions occur as an autoimmune response to infection elsewhere in the body—
typically GI or GU, although the preceding infection may have resolved or be
asymptomatic by the time the arthritis presents. Other clinical features: Iritis,
keratoderma blenorrhagica (brown, raised plaques on soles and palms), circinate
balanitis (painless penile ulceration secondary to Chlamydia), mouth ulcers, and
enthesitis. Patients may present with a triad of urethritis, arthritis, and conjunc-
tivitis (Reiter's syndrome). Tests: ESR & CRP. Culture stool if diarrhoea. Infec-
tious serology. Sexual health review. X-ray may show enthesitis with periosteal
reaction. Management: There is no specifi c cure. Splint aff ected joints acutely;
treat with NSAIDS or local steroid injections. Consider sulfasalazine or metho-
trexate if symptoms >6 months. Treating the original infection may make little
diff erence to the arthritis.
HLA-B27 disease associations
The HLA system plays a key role in immunity and self-recognition. More than one
hundred HLA B27 disease associations have been made40, yet the actual role of HLA
B27 in triggering an infl ammatory response is not fully understood. ~5% of the
UK population are HLA B27 positive—most do not have any disease. The chance of
an HLA B27 positive person developing spondyloarthritis or eye disease is 1 in 4.
Common associations include:
Ankylosing spondylitis: 85-95% of all those with AS are HLA B27 positive.
Acute anterior uveitis: 50–60% are HLA B27 positive.
Reactive arthritis: 60–85% are HLA B27 positive.
Enteric arthropathy: 50–60% are HLA B27 positive.
Psoriatic arthritis: 60–70% are HLA B27 positive.

Autoimmune connective tissue diseases
Included under this heading are SLE (p554), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren’s syndrome
(p710), idiopathic infl ammatory myopathies (myositis—see following topic), mixed
connective tissue disease, relapsing polychondritis, and undiff erentiated connective
tissue disease and overlap syndromes. They overlap with each other, aff ect many
organ systems, and often require immunosuppressive therapies (p376). Consider as a
diff erential in unwell patients with multi-organ involvement, especially if no infection.
Systemic sclerosis Features scleroderma (skin fi brosis), internal organ fi brosis,
and microvascular abnormalities. Severe cases have a 40–50% mortality at 5 years.
90% are ANA positive and 30–40% have anticentromere antibodies (see BOX). Skin dis-
ease is limited or diff use. Limited involves the face, hands, and feet (formally CREST
syndrome). It is associated with anticentromere antibodies in 70–80%. Pulmonary
hypertension is often present subclinically, and can become rapidly life-threatening,
so should be looked for (: sildenafi l, bosentan). Diffuse can involve the whole body.
Antitopoisomerase-1 (SCL-70) antibodies in 40% and anti-RNA polymerase in 20%.
Prognosis is often poor. Control BP meticulously. Perform annual echocardiogram
and spirometry. Both limited and diff use have the potential for organ fi brosis: lung,
cardiac, GI, and renal (p314) but this occurs later in limited sub-set.
Management: Currently no cure. Immunosuppressive regimens, including IV
cyclophos phamide, are used for organ involvement or progressive skin disease. Trials
of antifi brotic tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing.41 Monitor BP and renal function.
Regular ACE-i or A2RBS  risk of renal crisis (p314). Raynaud’s phenomenon: (see p708).
Mixed connective tissue disease Combines features of systemic sclerosis, SLE, and
polymyositis and the presence of high titres of anti-U1-RNP antibodies.
Relapsing polychondritis Rare condition with recurrent episodes of cartilage infl am-
mation and destruction. Aff ects pinna (fl oppy ears), nasal septum, larynx (stridor),
tracheobronchial tree (infections), and joints. Associations: Aortic valve disease, poly-
arthritis, and vasculitis. 30% have underlying rheumatic or autoimmune disease. Di-
agnosis is clinical. : Steroids, DMARDS or CPAP/tracheostomy for airway involvement.
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis
Rare conditions characterized by insidious onset of progressive symmetrical proxi-
mal muscle weakness and autoimmune-mediated striated muscle infl ammation
(myositis), associated with myalgia ± arthralgia. Muscle weakness may also cause
dysphagia, dysphonia (ie poor phonation, not dysphasia), or respiratory weakness.
The myositis (esp. in dermatomyositis) may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, com-
monly from lung, pancreatic, ovarian, or bowel malignancy. Screen for cancers.
Dermatomyositis Myositis plus skin signs: •Macular rash (shawl sign is +ve if
over back and shoulders). •Lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids often with
oedema (fi g 12.26, p563). •Nailfold erythema (dilated capillary loops). •Gottron’s
papules: roughened red papules over the knuckles, also seen on elbows and knees
(pathognomonic if CK + muscle weakness). Malignancy in 30% cases.
Extra-muscular signs In both conditions include fever, arthralgia, Raynaud’s, in-
terstitial lung fi brosis and myocardial involvement (myocarditis, arrhythmias).
Tests Muscle enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, CK, & aldolase)  in plasma; EMG shows char-
acteristic fi brillation potentials; muscle biopsy confi rms diagnosis (and excludes
mimicking conditions). MRI shows muscle oedema in acute myositis. Autoantibody
associations: (see BOX) anti-Mi2, anti-Jo1—associated with acute onset and intersti-
tial lung fi brosis that should be treated aggressively.
Diff erential diagnoses Carcinomatous myopathy, inclusion-body myositis, mus-
cular dystrophy, PMR, endocrine/metabolic myopathy (eg steroids), rhabdomyoly-
sis, infection (eg HIV), drugs (penicillamine, colchicine, statins, or chloroquine).
Management Start prednisolone. Immunosuppressives (p376) and cytotoxics are
used early in resistant c ases. Hydroxychloroquine/topical tacrolimus for skin disease.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
SLE is a multisystemic autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies are made against a vari-
ety of autoantigens (eg ANA) which form immune complexes . Inadequate clearance
of immune complexes results in a host of immune responses which cause tissue
infl ammation and damage. Environmental triggers play a part (eg EBV p405).43
Prevalence ~0.2%. :≈9:1, typically women of child-bearing age. Commoner in
African-Caribbeans, Asians, and if HLA B8, DR2, or DR3 +ve. ~10% of patients have a
1st- or 2nd-degree relative with SLE.
Clinical features See BOX. Remitting and relapsing illness of variable presentation
and course. Features often non-specifi c (malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever) or or-
gan-specifi c and caused by active infl ammation or damage. Other features include
lymphadenopathy, weight loss,alopecia, nail-fold infarcts, non-infective endocarditis
(Libman–Sacks syndrome), Raynaud’s (30%; see p708), stroke, and retinal exudates.
Immunology >95% are ANA +ve. A high anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody
titre is highly specifi c, but only +ve in ~60% of cases. ENA (p553) may be +ve in 20–30%
(anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP); 40% are RhF +ve; antiphospholipid antibodies (an-
ticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant) may also be +ve. SLE may be associated with other
autoimmune conditions: Sjögren’s (15–20%), autoimmune thyroid disease (5–10%).
Diagnosis See BOX. Monitoring activity Three best tests: 1 Anti-dsDNA antibody ti-
tres. 2 Complement: C3, C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence C3 and C4,
and C3d and C4d, their degradation products). 3 ESR. Also: BP, urine for casts or pro-
tein (lupus nephritis, below), FBC, U&E, LFTs, CRP (usually normal) think of SLE when-
ever someone has a multisystem disorder and ESR but CRP normal. If CRP, think
instead of infection, serositis, or arthritis. Skin or renal biopsies may be diagnostic.
Drug-induced lupus Causes (>80 drugs) include isoniazid, hydralazine (if >50mg/24h
in slow acetylators), procainamide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, minocycline, phenyto-
in, anti-TNF agents. It is associated with antihistone antibodies in >95% of cases. Skin
and lung signs prevail (renal and CNS are rarely aff ected). The disease remits if the
drug is stopped. Sulfonamides or the oral contraceptive pill may worsen idiopathic SLE.
Management Refer: complex cases should involve specialist SLE/nephritis clinics.
• General measures: High-factor sunblock. Hydroxychloroquine, unless contraindi-
cated, reduces disease activity and improves survival. Screen for co-morbidities
and medication toxicity. For skin fl ares, fi rst trial topical steroids.
• Maintenance: NSAIDs (unless renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and
skin symptoms. Azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-spar-
ing agents. Belimumab (monoclonal antibody) used as an add-on therapy for auto-
antibody positive disease where disease activity is high.44 (See BOX.)
• Mild fl ares: (No serious organ damage.) Hydroxychloroquine or low-dose steroids.
• Moderate fl ares: (Organ involvement.) May require DMARDs or mycophenolate.
Severe fl ares: If life- or organ-threatening, eg haemolytic anaemia, nephritis,
severe pericarditis or CNS disease; urgent high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, rituxi-
mab, cyclophosphamide. MDT working vital for neuropsychiatric lupus (psychometric
testing, lumbar puncture may be indicated).
Lupus nephritis: (p314.) May require more intensive immunosuppression with ster-
oids and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. BP control vital (e.g. ACE-i). Renal re-
placement therapy (p306) may be needed if disease progresses; nephritis recurs in
~50% post-transplant, but is a rare cause of graft failure.45
Prognosis: ~80% survival at 15 years.43 There is an increased long-term risk of CVD
and osteoporosis.
Antiphospholipid syndrome Can be associated with SLE (20–30%). Often occurs
as a primary disease. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin & lupus antico-
agulant, anti- 2 glycoprotein 1) cause CLOTS: Coagulation defect (arterial/venous),
Livedo reticularis (p557), Obstetric (recurrent miscarriage), Thrombocytopenia.
Thrombotic tendency aff ects cerebral, renal, and other vessels. Dx: Persistent an-
tiphosphlolipid antibodies with clinical features. : Anticoagulation; seek advice in
pregnancy.46

Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Classifi cation
A favourite diff erential diagnosis, SLE mimics other illnesses, with wide variation in
symptoms that may come and go unpredictably. Diagnose SLE47 in an appropriate
clinical setting if ≥4 criteria (at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory) or biopsy-proven
lupus nephritis with positive ANA or anti-DNA.
Clinical criteria
1 Acute cutaneous lupus: Malar rash/butterfl y. Fixed erythema, fl at or raised,
over the malar eminences, tending to spare the nasolabial folds (fi g 12.14).
Occurs in up to 50%. Bullous lupus, toxic epidermal necrolysis variant of SLE,
maculopapular lupus rash, photosensitive lupus rash, or subacute cutaneous
lupus (non-indurated psoriasiform and/or annular polycyclic lesions that re-
solve without scarring).
2 Chronic cutaneous lupus: Discoid rash, erythematous raised patches with ad-
herent keratotic scale s and follicular plugging ± atrophic scarring (fi g 12.15).
Think of it as a three-stage rash aff ecting ears, cheeks, scalp, forehead, and
chest: erythemapigmented hyperkeratotic oedematous papulesatrophic
depressed lesions.
3 Non scarring alopecia: (In the absence of other causes.)
4 Oral/nasal ulcers: (In the absence of other causes.)

Vasculitis
The vasculitides are infl ammatory disorders of blood vessels; commonly classifi ed
using the modifi ed Chapel Hill criteria.48 They can aff ect any organ, and presentation
depends on the organs involved. It may be a primary condition or secondary to other
diseases, eg SLE, RA, hepatitis B & C, HIV. Categorized by size of blood vessels aff ected.
• Large Giant cell arteritis, Takayasu’s arteritis (see p712).
• Medium Polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease (OHCS p646).
• Small • ANCA-associated: microscopic polyangiitis; granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(Wegener’s granulomatosis); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg
Strauss syndrome; 40–60% are ANCA positive). • Immune complex vasculitis: Goodpas-
ture’s disease; cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis; IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein purpura).
• Variable vessel vasculitis Behçet’s (p694) and Cogan’s syndrome.
Symptoms Diff erent vasculitides preferentially aff ect diff erent organs, causing dif-
ferent patterns of symptoms (see BOX ‘Features of vasculitis’), Often only overwhelm-
ing fatigue with ESR/CRP. Consider vasculitis in any unidentifi ed multisystem
disorder. If presentation does not fi t clinically or serologically into a specifi c cat-
egory consider malignancy-associated vasculitis. A severe vasculitis fl are is a medi-
cal emergency. If suspected, seek urgent help, as organ damage may occur rapidly
(eg critical renal failure <24h). Tests ESR/CRP. ANCA may be +ve. Creatinine if renal
failure. Urine: proteinuria, haematuria, casts on microscopy. Angiography ± biopsy
may be diagnostic. Management Large-vessel: steroids in most cases, may add ster-
oid-sparing agents later. Medium/small: immunosuppression (steroids, ± another agent,
eg cyclophosphamide if severe, or methotrexate/azathioprine depending on features).
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) = temporal arteritis Common in the elderly—consider
Takayasu’s if under 55yrs (p712). Associated with PMR in 50%. Symptoms: Headache,
temporal artery and scalp tenderness (eg when combing hair), tongue/jaw clau-
dication, amaurosis fugax, or sudden unliateral blindness. Extracranial symptoms:
malaise, dyspnoea, weight loss, morning stiff ness, and unequal or weak pulses.49 The
risk is irreversible bilateral visual loss, which can occur suddenly if not treated—ask
an ophthalmologist. Tests: ESR & CRP are , platelets, ALP, Hb. Temporal artery bi-
opsy within 14 days of starting steroids, or FDG-PET. Skip lesions occur, so don’t be
put off by a negative biopsy (up to 10%). Management: Start prednisolone 60mg/d
PO immediately or IV methylprednisolone if evolving visual loss or history of amau-
rosis fugax.50 Prognosis: Typically a 2-year course, then complete remission. Reduce
prednisolone once symptoms have resolved and ESR; dose if symptoms recur. Main
cause of death and morbidity in GCA is long-term steroid treatment so balance risks! Give
PPI, bisphosphonate, calcium with colecalciferol, and consider aspirin.6; 51
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) PAN is a necrotizing vasculitis that causes aneurysms
and thrombosis in medium-sized arteries, leading to infarction in aff ected organs
with severe systemic symptoms. :≈2:1. It may be associated with hepatitis B,
and is rare in the UK. Symptoms: See BOX. Systemic features, skin (rash, ‘punched
out’ ulcers, nodules), renal (main cause of death, renal artery narrowing, glomerular
ischaemia, insuffi ciency, HTN), cardiac, GI, GU, neuro involvement. Usually spares lungs.
Coronary aneurysms occur in Kawasaki disease (OHCS p646). Tests: Often WCC, mild
eosino philia (in 30%), anaemia, ESR, CRP, ANCA Ωve. Renal or mesenteric angiography
(see fi g 12.16), or renal biopsy can be diagnostic. Treatment: Control BP and refer.
Steroids for mild cases and steroid-sparing agents if more severe. Hepatitis B should
be treated (p278) after initial treatment with steroids.52
Microscopic polyangiitis A necrotizing vasculitis aff ecting small- and medium-
sized vessels. Symptoms: Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis usually features;
pulmonary haemorrhage occurs in up to 30%; other features are rare. Tests: pANCA
(MPO) +ve (p553). Treatment: Steroids plus eg methotrexate. For maintenance: meth-
otrexate, rituximab, or azathioprine.
Hypocomplementaemic urticarial vasculitis A lupus-like illness with urticaria
and antibodies to complement (C1q).
6 Low-dose aspirin has been shown to decrease the rate of visual loss and cerebrovascular accidents in GCA
but there are also confl icting reports regarding its effi cacy at preventing ischaemic events in GCA.

Features of vasculitis
The presentation of vasculitis will depend on the organs aff ected:
Systemic: Fever,malaise,weight loss,arthralgia,myalgia.
Skin: Purpura, ulcers, livedo reticularis (fi g 12.17), nailbed infarcts, digital gangrene.
Eyes: Episcleritis,scleritis,visual loss.
ENT: Epistaxis, nasal crusting, stridor, deafness.
Pulmonary: Haemoptysis and dyspnoea (due to pulmonary haemorrhage).
Cardiac: Angina or MI (due to coronary arteritis), heart failure, and pericarditis.
GI: Pain or perforation (infarcted viscus), malabsorption (chronic ischaemia).
Renal: Hypertension, haematuria, proteinuria, casts, and renal failure (renal corti-
cal infarcts; glomerulonephritis in ANCA +ve vasculitis).
Neurological: Stroke, fi ts, chorea, psycho sis,confusion, impaired cognition, al-
tered mood. Arteritis of the vasa nervorum (arterial supply to peripheral nerves)
may cause mononeuritis multiplex or a sensorimotor polyneuropathy.53
GU: Orchitis—testicular pain or tenderness.
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)
PMR is not a true vasculitis and its pathogenesis is unknown. PMR and GCA share
the same demographic characteristics and, although separate conditions, the two
frequently occur together.
Features: Age >50yrs; subacute onset (<2 weeks) of bilateral aching, tenderness,
and morning stiff ness in shoulders, hips, and proximal limb muscles ± fatigue, fe-
ver, weight, anorexia, and depression. There may be associated mild poly arthritis,
tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (10%). Weakness is not a feature.
Investigations: CRP, ESR typically >40 (but may be normal); AlkP is  in 30%. Note
creatinine kinase levels are normal (helping to distinguish from myositis/myopathies).
Differential diagnoses: Recent-onset RA, polymyositis, hypothyroidism, primary
muscle disease, occult malignancy or infection, osteoarthritis (especially cervical
spondylosis, shoulder OA), neck lesions, bilateral subacromial impingement (OHCS
p666), spinal stenosis (OHCS p676).
Management: Prednisolone 15mg/d PO. Expect a dramatic response within 1
week and consider an alternative diagnosis if not.  dose slowly, eg by 1mg/month
(according to symptoms/ESR). Investigate apparent ‘fl ares’ during withdrawal—
attributable to another condition? Most need steroids for ≥2yrs, so give bone pro-
tection. Addition of methotrexate may be considered, under specialist supervision,
for patients at risk of relapse/prolonged therapy. NSAIDS are not eff ective. Inform
patients to seek urgent review if symptoms of GCA develop.

Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome
Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are part of a diff use group of overlap-
ping syndromes, sharing similar demographic and clinical characteristics, in which
chronic symptoms of fatigue and widespread pain feature prominently. Their exist-
ence as discrete entities is controversial, especially in the absence of clear pathol-
ogy, and some fi nd such dysfunctional diagnoses frustrating. However, a correct
diagnosis enables the doctor to give appropriate counselling and advise appropriate
therapies, and allows the patient to begin to accept and deal with their symptoms.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia comprises up to 10% of new referrals to the rheumatology clinic.54
Prevalence: 0.5–4%. :≈6:1 but varies depending on which diagnostic criteria are
used .
Risk factors: BOX ‘Risk factors’. Female sex, middle age, low household income, di-
vorced, low educational status.
Associations: Other somatic syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable
bowel syndrome (p266), and chronic headaches syndromes (see OHCS p502). Also
found in ~25% of patients with RA, AS, and SLE.
Features: Diagnosis depends on pain that is chronic (>3 months) and widespread
(involves left and right sides, above and below the waist, and the axial skeleton).
Profound fatigue is almost universal with complaint of unrefreshing sleep and
signifi cant fatigue and pain with small increases in physical exertion. Additional
features: morning stiff ness (~80–90%), paraesthesiae (without underlying cause),
headaches (migraine and tension), poor concentration, low mood, and sleep distur-
bance (~70%). Widespread and severe tender points.
Investigations: All normal. Diagnosis is clinical. Over-investigation can consolidate
illness behaviour; but exclude other causes of pain and/or fatigue (eg RA, PMR see
p557, vasculitis see p556, hypothyroidism see p220, myeloma see p368).
Management: Multidisciplinary with optimal results coming from full engagement
of the patient who should be encouraged to remain as active as they feel able, and
ideally to continue to participate in the workforce. New symptoms should be fully
reviewed to exclude an alternative diagnosis. Patients should be advised that there
is no one specifi c treatment that is guaranteed to work, but any of the following may
help: graded exercise programmes, including both aerobic and strength-based train-
ing. Pacing of activity is vital to avoid over-exertion and consequent pain and fatigue.
Long-term graded exercise programmes improve functional capacity.55, 56 Relaxa-
tion, rehabilitation and physiotherapy may also help. Cognitive-behavioural therapy
(CBT) aims to help patients develop coping strategies and set achievable goals.57
Pharmacotherapy: Low-dose amitriptyline (eg 10–20mg at night) has been shown
to help relieve pain and improve sleep. Pregabalin (150–300mg/12h PO) can be used if
amitriptyline is ineff ective. Duloxetine or an SSRI can be used for fi bromyalgia with
comorbid anxiety and depression. Steroids or NSAIDS are not recommended because
there is no infl ammation (if it does respond, reconsider your diagnosis!).
Chronic fatigue syndrome (AKA myalgic encephalomyelitis)
Chronic fatigue syndrome58 is defi ned as persistent disabling fatigue lasting >6
months, aff ecting mental and physical function, present >50% of the time, plus ≥4
of: myalgia (~80%), polyarthralgia, memory, unrefreshing sleep, fatigue after exer-
tion >24h, persistent sore throat, tender cervical/axillary lymph nodes. Management
principles are similar to fi bromyalgia and include graded exercise and CBT. No phar-
macological agents have yet been proved eff ective for chronic fatigue syndrome
(see also OHCS p502).

Risk factors: yellow fl ags
Psychosocial risk factors for developing persisting chronic pain and long-term
disability have been termed ‘yellow fl ags’: 59
Belief that pain and activity are harmful.
Sickness behaviours such as extended rest.
Social withdrawal.
Emotional problems such as low mood, anxiety, or stress.
Problems or dissatisfaction at work.
Problems with claims for compensation or time off work.
Overprotective family or lack of support.
Inappropriate expectations of treatment, eg low active participation in treatment.
An existential approach to diffi cult symptoms
The manner in which management is discussed is almost as important as the
management itself, which should focus on education of the patient and their fam-
ily and on developing coping strategies. Such a diagnosis may be a relief or a
disappointment to the patient. Explain that fi bromyalgia is a relapsing and re-
mitting condition, with no easy cures, and that they will continue to have good
and bad days. Reassure them that there is no serious underlying pathology, that
their joints are not being damaged, and that no further tests are necessary, but
be sympathetic to the fact that they may have been seeking a physical cause for
their symptoms.
We all at some stage come across a patient with diffi cult symptoms and an
exasperating lack of pathology to explain them. Investigations are all normal,
and medications do not seem to work. It is tempting to dismiss such patients as
malingerers, but often this conclusion comes from the clinician approaching the
problem from the wrong angle. The patient has symptoms that are real and disa-
bling to them, and that will not improve without help. Perhaps a more pragmatic
approach is to take advice from the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard who wrote to
a friend in 1835, ‘What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not
what I am to know ... The thing is to understand myself ... to fi nd a truth which is
true for me.’ Listen to the patient and accept their story. Then help them to focus
on what they can do to improve their situation, and to move away from dwelling
on fi nding a physical answer to their symptoms.
Pathogenesis of fi bromyalgia
The current hypothesis is that fi bromyalgia is caused by aberrant peripheral and
central pain processing. Two key features of the condition are allodynia (pain in re-
sponse to a non-painful stimulus) and hyperaesthesia (exaggerated perception of
pain in response to a mildly painful stimulus), examined for by palpation of tender
points. Research is beginning to suggest that certain antidepressants can relieve
pain and other symptoms, and especially those that have both serotonergic and
noradrenergic activity (tricyclics and venlafaxine). Those acting on serotonergic
receptors only are less eff ective. There is also some evidence to support the use
of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and spa therapies, which have been
postulated to act through similar spinal pain-modulatory pathways.60 Thus far,
trials have involved relatively small numbers of patients or short time periods,
and lack the power to draw strong conclusions. However, it is interesting to note
that the CSF of patients with fi bromyalgia appears to have increased levels of sub-
stance P, while levels of noradrenaline and serotonin metabolites are decreased.
All three are neurotransmitters involved in descending pain-modulatory pathways
in the spinal cord.61, 62 Evidence from PET imaging suggests that patients with fi bro-
myalgia may have an abnormal central dopamine response to pain.63 The critical
question is: is this cause or eff ect?

Systemic conditions causing eye signs
The eye is host to many diseases: the more you look, the more you’ll see, and the
more you’ll enjoy, not least because the eye is as beautiful as its signs are legion.
Behçet’s (p694.) Systemic infl ammatory disorder, HLA B27 association. Causes a uvei-
tis amongst other systemic manifestations. Cause unknown.
Granulomatous disorders Syphilis, TB, sarcoidosis, leprosy, brucellosis, and tox-
oplasmosis may infl ame either the front chamber (anterior uveitis/iritis) or back
chamber (posterior uveitis/choroiditis). Refer to an ophthalmologist.
Systemic infl ammatory diseases May manifest as iritis in ankylosing spondylitis
and reactive arthritis; uveitis in Behçet’s; conjunctivitis in reactive arthritis; scle-
ritis or episcleritis in RA, vasculitis, and SLE. Scleritis in RA and granulomatosis with
polyangiitis (Wegener’s) may damage the eye. Refer urgently if eye pain. GCA
causes optic nerve ischaemia presenting as sudden blindness.
Keratoconjunctivitis sicca A reduction in tear formation, tested by the Schirmer
fi lter paper test (<5mm in 5min). It causes a gritty feeling in the eyes, and a dry
mouth (xerostomia from saliva production). It is found on its own (Sjögren’s syn-
drome), or with other diseases, eg SLE, RA, sarcoidosis. : Artifi cial tears/saliva.
Hypertensive retinopathy BP damages retinal vessels. Hardened ar-
teries are shiny (‘silver wiring’; fi g 12.18) and ‘nip’ veins where they cross
(AV nipping; fi g 12.19). Narrowed arterioles may become blocked, causing localized
retinal infarction, seen as cotton-wool spots. Leaks from these in severe hyperten-
sion manifest as hard exudates or macular oedema. Papilloedema (fi g 12.20) or fl ame
haemorrhages suggest accelerated hypertension (p138) requiring urgent treatment.
Vascular occlusion Emboli passing through the retinal vasculature may cause
retinal artery occlusion (global or segmental retinal pallor) or amaurosis fugax
(p476). Roth spots (small retinal infarcts occur in infective endocarditis. In der-
matomyositis, there is orbital oedema with retinopathy showing cotton-wool spots
(micro-infarcts). Retinal vein occlusion is caused by BP, age, or hyperviscosity
(p372). Suspect in any acute fall in acuity. If it is the central vein, the fundus is like a
stormy sunset (those angry red clouds are haemorrhages). In branch vein occlusion,
changes are confi ned to a wedge of retina. Get expert help.
Haematological disorders Retinal haemorrhages occur in leukaemia; comma-
shaped conjunctival haemorrhages and retinal new vessel formation may occur in
sickle-cell disease. Optic atrophy is seen in pernicious anaemia (and also MS).
Metabolic disease Diabetes mellitus: p210. Hyperthyroid exophthalmos: p219. Lens
opacities are seen in hypoparathyroidism. Conjunctival and corneal calcifi cation can
occur in hypercalcaemia. In gout, conjunctival urate deposits may cause sore eyes.
Systemic infections Septicaemia may seed to the vitreous causing endophtha l-
mitis. Syphilis can cause iritis (+ pigmented retinopathy if congenital). Systemic fun-
gal infections may aff ect the eye, eg in the immunocompromised or in IV drug users,
requiring intra-vitreal antibiotics. AIDS and HIV CMV retinitis (pizza-pie fundus—a
mixture of cotton-wool spots, infi ltrates, and haemorrhages, p438) may be asympto-
matic but can cause sudden visual loss. If present, it implies AIDS (CD4 count <100 ≈
106/L; p398). Cotton-wool spots on their own indicate HIV retinopathy and may occur
in early disease. Kaposi’s sarcoma may aff ect the lids (non-tender purple nodule) or
conjunctiva (red fl eshy mass).

Skin manifestations of systemic diseases
Erythema nodosum (fi g 12.21) Painful, blue-red, raised lesions on shins (± thighs/
arms). Causes: sarcoidosis, drugs (sulfonamides, contraceptive pill, dapsone), strep-
tococcal infection. Less common: IBD, BCG vaccination, leptospirosis, Mycobacte-
rium (TB, leprosy), Yersinia, or various viruses and fungi. Cause unknown in 30–50%.
Erythema multiforme (See OHCS p588.) (fi g 12.22) ‘Target’ lesions: symmetrical ±
central blister, on palms/soles, limbs, and elsewhere. Stevens–Johnson syndrome
(p710): a rare, s evere variant with fever and mucosal involvement (mouth, genital, and
eye ulcers), associated with a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (NSAIDS, sulfonamides,
anticonvulsants, allopurinol), or infections (herpes, Mycoplasma, orf). Also seen in col-
lagen disorders. 50% of cases are idiopathic. Get expert help in severe disease.
Erythema migrans (fi g 12.23) Presents as a small papule at the site of a tick bite
which develops into a spreading large erythematous ring, with central fading. It lasts
from 48h to 3 months and there may be multiple lesions in disseminated disease. Cause:
the rash is pathognomonic of Lyme disease and occurs in ~80% of cases (p422).
Erythema marginatum Pink coalescent rings on trunk which come and go. It is
seen in rheumatic fever (or rarely other causes, eg drugs). See fi g 3.42, p143.
Pyoderma gangrenosum (fi g 12.24) Recurring nodulo-pustular ulcers, ~10cm wide,
with tender red/blue overhanging necrotic edge, purulent surface, and healing with
cribriform scars on leg, abdomen, or face. Associations: IBD, autoimmune hepatitis,
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s), myeloma, neoplasia. >. Treatment:
get help. Oral steroids ± ciclosporin should be 1st-line therapy.64
Vitiligo (fi g 12.25) Vitellus is Latin for spotted calf: typically white patches ± hyper-
pigmented borders. Sunlight makes them itch. Associations: autoimmune disorders;
premature ovarian failure. Treat by camoufl age cosmetics and sunscreens (± steroid
creams ± dermabrasion). UK Vitiligo Society: 0800 018 2631.
Specifi c diseases and their skin manifestations
Crohn’s Perianal/vulval/oral ulcers; erythema nodosum; pyoderma gangrenosum.
Dermatomyositis Gottron’s papules (rough red papules on the knuckles/extensor
surfaces); shawl sign; heliotrope rash on eyelids (fi g 12.26). It may be associated with
lung, bowel, ovarian, or pancreatic malignancy (p552).
Diabetes mellitus Ulcers, necrobiosis lipoidica (shiny yellowish area on shin ± tel-
angiectasia; fi g 12.27), granuloma annulare (OHCS p586), acanthosis nigricans (pig-
mented, rough thickening of axillary, neck, or groin skin with warty lesions; fi g 12.28).
Coeliac disease Dermatitis herpetiformis: Itchy blisters, in groups on knees, el-
bows, and scalp. The itch (which can drive patients to suicide) responds to dapsone
25–200mg/24h PO within 48h—and this may be used as a diagnostic test. The mainte-
nance dose may be as little as 50mg/wk. A gluten-free diet should be adhered to, but
in 30% dapsone will need to be continued. SE (dose-related): haemolysis (CI: anaemia,
G6PD-defi ciency), hepatitis, agranulocytosis (monitor FBC and LFTS). There is an  risk
of small bowel lymphoma with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis—so
surveillance is needed.
Hyperthyroidism Pretibial myxoedema: Red oedematous swellings above lateral
malleoli, progressing to thickened oedema of legs and feet, thyroid acropachy—
clubbing + subperiosteal new bone in phalanges. Other endocrinopathies: p203.
Liver disease Palmar erythema; spider naevi; gynaecomastia; decrease in pubic
hair; jaundice; bruising; scratch marks.
Malabsorption Dry pigmented skin, easy bruising, hair loss, leuconychia.
Neoplasia Acanthosis nigricans: (See ‘Diabetes mellitus’ and fi g 12.28.) Associ-
ated with gastric cancer. Dermatomyositis: see earlier in topic. Thrombophlebitis
migrans: Successive crops of tender nodules aff ecting blood vessels throughout
the body, associated with pancreatic cancer (especially body and tail). Acquired
ichthyosis: Dry scaly skin associated with lymphoma. Skin metastases: Especially
melanoma, and colonic, lung, breast, laryngeal/oral, or ovarian malignancy.

• Ensure that the right patient gets the right surgery. Have the symptoms and signs
changed? If so, inform the surgeon.
• Assess/balance risks of anaesthesia, and maximize fi tness. Comorbidities? Drugs?
Smoker? Optimizing oxygenation before major surgery improves outcome.
• Obtain informed consent (p568).
• Check proposed anaesthesia/analgesia with anaesthetist.
Family history May be relevant, eg in malignant hyperpyrexia (p572); dystrophia
myotonica (p510); porphyria; cholinesterase problems; sickle-cell disease.
Drugs Any drug/plaster/antiseptic allergies? Inform the anaesthetist about all
drugs even if ‘over-the-counter’. Steroids: see p590; diabetes: see p588.
• Antibiotics: Tetracycline and neomycin may  neuromuscular blockade.
• Anticoagulants: Tell the surgeon. Avoid epidural, spinal, and regional blocks.
Aspirin should probably be continued unless there is a major risk of bleeding. Dis-
cuss stopping clopidogrel therapy with the cardiologists/neurologists. See p590.
• Anticonvulsants: Give as usual pre-op. Post-op, give drugs IV (or by NGT) until able
to take orally. Valproate: give usual dose IV. Phenytoin: give IV slowly (<50mg/min,
on cardiac monitor). IM phenytoin absorption is unreliable.
• -blockers: Continue up to and including the day of surgery as this precludes a
labile cardiovascular response.
• Contraceptive pill: See BNF. Stop 4wks before major/leg surgery; ensure alterna-
tive contraception is used. Restart 2wks after surgery, provided patient is mobile.
• Digoxin: Continue up to and including morning of surgery. Check for toxicity (ECG;
plasma level); do plasma K+ and Ca2+ (suxamethonium can K+ and lead to ventricu-
lar arrhythmias in the fully digitalized).
• Diuretics: Beware hypokalaemia, dehydration. Do U&E (and bicarbonate).
• Eye-dr o ps: -blockers get systemically absorbed.
• HRT: As with contraceptive pill there may be an increased risk of DVT/PE.
• Levodopa: Possible arrhythmias when patient under GA.
• Lithium: Get expert help; may potentiate neuromuscular blockade and cause ar-
rhythmias. See OHCS p349.
• MAOIS: Get expert help as interactions may cause hypotensive/hypertensive crises.
• Thyroid medication: see p600.
• Tricyclics: These enhance adrenaline (epinephrine) and arrhythmias.
Preparation Starve patient; NBM ≥2h pre-op for clear fl uids and ≥6h for solids.1
• Is any bowel or skin preparation needed, or prophylactic antibiotics (p570)?
• Start DVT prophylaxis as indicated, eg graduated compression stockings (CI in pe-
ripheral arterial disease); LMWH (p350): eg moderate risk, 20mg ~2h pre-op then
20mg/24h; high risk (eg orthopaedic surgery), 40mg 12h pre-op then 40mg/24h;
or heparin 5000U SC 2h pre-op, then every 8–12h SC for 7d or until ambulant.
• Ensure necessary premedications (p572), regular medications, analgesia, anti-
emetics, antibiotics are all prescribed as appropriate. Confi rm NBM.
• Book any pre-, intra-, or post-operative x-rays or frozen sections.
• Book post-operative physiotherapy.
• If needed, site IV cannula, catheterize (p762), and/or insert a Ryle’s tube (p759).
• Meta-analyses have shown no benefi t to patients from mechanical bowel cleansing
before colonic surgery—this is no longer considered good practice. There is also no
evidence for the use of enemas prior to rectal surgery.

Pre-operative history, examination, and tests
It is the anaesthetist’s responsibility to assess suitability for anaesthesia. The
ward doctor assists with a good history and examination, should anticipate nec-
essary tests, and can also reassure and inform the patient. The surgical team
should consent the patient.
The World Health Organization ‘Surgical Safety Checklist’ should be completed
for every patient undergoing a surgical procedure, ensuring pre-operative prepa-
ration, intra-operative monitoring, and post-operative review.
History Assess past history of: MI1, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, rheumatic fe-
ver, epilepsy, jaundice. Existing illnesses, drugs, and allergies? Be alert to chronic
lung disease, BP, arrhyt hmias, and murmurs. Assess any specifi c risks, eg is the
patient pregnant? Is the neck/jaw immobile and teeth stable (intubation risk)? Has
there been previous anaesthesia? Were there any complications (eg nausea, DVT)?
Examination Assess cardiorespiratory system, exercise tolerance. Is the neck
unstable (eg arthritis complicating intubation)? Is DVT/PE prophy laxis needed
(p578)? For ‘unilateral’ surgery, mark the correct arm/leg/kidney (surgeon).
Tests Be guided by the history and examination and local/NICE protocols.
• U&E, FBC, and fi nger-prick blood glucose in most patients. If Hb <100g/L tell
anaesthetist. Investigate/treat as appropriate. U&E are particularly important if
the patient is starved, diabetic, on diuretics, a burns patient, has hepatic or renal
disease, has an ileus, or is parenterally fed.
• Crossmatch: Blood type is identifi ed and units are allocated to the patient.
Group and save (G&S): Blood type is identifi ed and held, pending crossmatch
(if required). Contact your lab to discuss requirements—this decreases wastage
and allows increased effi ciency of blood stocks.
• Specifi c blood tests: LFT in jaundice, malignancy, or alcohol abuse. Amylase in
acute abdominal pain. Blood glucose if diabetic (p588). Drug levels as appropri-
ate (eg digoxin, lithium). Clotting studies in liver or renal disease, DIC (p352),
massive blood loss, or if on valproate, warfarin, or heparin. HIV, HBsAg in high-risk
patients, after counselling. Sickle test in those from Africa, West Indies, or Medi-
terranean—and if origins are in malarial areas (including most of India). Thyroid
function tests in those with thyroid disease.
• CXR if known cardiorespiratory disease, pathology, or symptoms or >65yrs old.
Remember to check the fi lm prior to surgery.
• ECG if >55yrs old or poor exercise tolerance, or history of myocardial ischaemia,
hypertension, rheumatic fever, or other heart disease.
• Echocardiogram may be performed if there is a suspicion of poor LV function.
• Pulmonary function tests in known pulmonary disease/obesity.
• Lateral cervical spine X-ray (fl exion and extension views) if history of rheumatoid
arthritis/ankylosing spondylitis/Down’s syndrome, to warn of diffi cult intubations.
• MRSA screen: Screen and decolonize nasal carriers according to local policy (eg
nasal mupirocin ointment). Colonization is not a cont ra indication to surgery.
Place patients last on the list to minimize transmission to others and cover with
appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, eg vancomycin or teicoplanin. Consider and
document major blood-borne virus risk (HIV/HBV/HCV) according to local policies.
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classifi cation
Class I Normally healthy patient.
Class II Mild systemic disease.
Class III Severe systemic disease that limits activity but is not incapacitating.
Class IV Incapacitating systemic disease which poses a constant threat to life.
Class V Moribund: not expected to survive 24h even with operation.
You will see a space for an ASA number on most anaesthetic charts. It is a health.
index at the time of surgery. The suffi x E is used in emergencies, eg ASA 2E.
1 If within the last 6 months, the perioperative risk of re-infarction (up to 40%) makes most elective surgery
too risky. ECHO, and stress testing (+ exercise ECG or MUGA scan, p741) should be done.

Consent
In which of the following situations would you seek ‘informed written consent’
from a patient? 1 Feeling for a pulse. 2 Taking blood. 3 Inserting a central line.
4 Removing a section of small bowel during a laparotomy for division of adhesions.
5 Orchidectomy after a failed operation for testicular torsion.
English law states that any intervention or treatment needs consent—ie all of the
above—yet, for diff erent reasons. In fact, written consent itself is not required by
law, but it does constitute ‘good medical practice’ in the best interests of the patient
and practitioner. Sometimes actions and words can imply valid consent, eg by simply
entering into conversation or holding out an arm. If the consequences are not clear
and the patient has capacity to give consent, you should seek informed written
consent as a record of your conversation.
For consent to be valid
• It can be given any time before the intervention/treatment is initiated. Earlier is
better as this will give the patient time to think about the risks, benefi ts, and al-
ternatives—he or she may even bring forward questions on issues that you had
not considered relevant. Think of consent as an ongoing process throughout the
patient’s time with you, not just the moment of signing the form.
• The proposed treatment or test must be clearly understood by the patient, taking
into account the benefi ts, risks (including complication rates if known), additional
procedures, alternative courses of action, and their consequences.
• It must be given voluntarily. This can be diffi cult to evaluate—eg when live organ
donation is being considered—see BOX ‘Special circumstances for consent’ for other
diffi cult situations.
• The doctor providing treatment or undertaking the test needs to ensure that the
patient has given valid consent. The act of seeking consent is ultimately the respon-
sibility of the doctor looking after the patient, though the task may be delegated
to another health professional, as long as they are suitably trained and qualifi ed.
Capacity relates to the ability to 1 understand, 2 retain, and 3 weigh up relevant
information and 4 communicate the decision. Capacity is not a fi xed state, but is
specifi c to any given time and decision—a person may lack capacity to be involved
in a particular complex decision but retain capacity to decide other aspects of their
care, or recover capacity as they recover from acute illness. Therefore, do not label
anyone as unable to make a decision unless you have taken all practicable steps to
help them to do so without success—non-urgent decisions should always be deferred
if there is a chance to recover capacity. When acting on behalf of a person who lacks
capacity, do so in their best interests and involve family members or an appointed
surrogate where clinical urgency allows.
When taking consent
• Does the patient currently have capacity for the decision in question?
• Are you the right person to be obtaining consent?2
• Use words the patient understands and avoid jargon and abbreviations.
• Ensure that they believe your facts and can retain ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ long enough to
inform their decision. Fact sheets/diagrams for individual operations help.
• Make sure their choice is free from pressure from others, and explain that they can
withdraw consent at any time after the form is signed. Some patients may view the
consent form as a contract from which they cannot renege.
• If the patient is illiterate, a witnessed mark does endorse valid consent. Similarly,
if the patient is willing but physically unable to sign the consent form, then a wit-
nessed entry into the medical notes stating so is valid.
• Remember to discuss further procedures that may become necessary during the
proposed treatment. This avoids waking up to a nasty surprise (eg a missing testi-
cle as in scenario 5 earlier in this topic).

Special circumstances for consent
Consent is complex, but remember that it exists for the benefi t of the patient
and the doctor, giving you an opportunity to revisit expectations and involve the
patient in their own care. There are some areas of treatment or investigation for
which it may be a dvisable to seek specialist advice if it is not part of your regular
practice2:
• Photography of a patient.
• Innovative or novel treatment.
• Living organ donation.
• Storage, use, or removal of human tissue (for any length of time).
• The storage, loss, or use of gametes.
• The use of patient records or tissue in research or teaching.
• In the presence of an advanced directive or living will, expressly refusing a par-
ticular treatment, investigation, or action.
• Consent if <16yrs (consent form 3 in NHS). In the UK, those >16yrs can give valid
consent. Those <16yrs can give consent for a medical decision provided they
understand what it involves—the concept of Gillick competence. It is still good
practice to involve the parents in the decision, if the child is willing. If <18yrs
and refusing life-saving surgery, talk to the parents and your senior; the law is
unclear. You may need to contact the duty judge in the High Court.
• Consent in the incapacitated (NHS consent form 4). No one (parents, relat ives, or
even members of a healthcare team) is able to give consent on behalf of an adult
in England, and the High Court may be required to give a ruling on the matters
of lawfulness of a proposed procedure. Proceeding in a patient’s best interest is
decided by the clinician overseeing their care, with involvement of family mem-
bers or a nominated advocate.
The right to refuse treatment
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die. Alfred, Lord Tennyson from The Charge of the Light Brigade, 1854.
The rights of a patient are something of an antithesis to this military macabre of
Tennyson, and it is our responsibility to respect the legal and ethical rights of those
we treat. We do this not only for the sake of the individual, but also for the sake
of an enduring trust between the patient and doctor, remembering that it is the
patient’s right to refuse treatment (if a fully competent adult) even when this may
result in the death of the patient, or even the death of an unborn child, whatever
the stage of pregnancy. The only exceptions apply to treatment of mental health
disorders (see eg in England and Wales the Mental Health Act 2007).
2 If in any doubt, turn to: your senior/consultant; your employing organization; your legal defence organiza-
tion; your national medical association; your local research ethics committee.

Prophylactic antibiotics in surgery
Prophylactic antibiotics are given to counter the risk of wound infection (see table
13.1), which occurs in ~20% of elective GI surgery (up to 60% in emergency surgery).
Antibiotics are also given if infection elsewhere, although unlikely, would have severe
consequences (eg when prostheses are involved). A single dose given before surgery
has been shown to be just as good as more prolonged regimens in biliary and colo-
rectal surgery. Additional doses may be given if high-risk/prolonged procedures, or
if major blood loss. Wound infections are not necessarily trivial since sepsis may
lead to haemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and initiate a fatal chain of events, so take
measures to minimize the risk of wound infection:
• Time administration correctly (eg IV prophylaxis should be given 30min prior to
surgery to maximize skin concentration; metronidazole PR is given 2h before).
• Use antibiotics which will kill anaerobes and coliforms.
• Consider use of peri-operative supplemental oxygen. This is a practical method
of reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections.
• Practise strictly sterile surgical technique. (Ask for a hand with scrubbing up if
you are not sure—theatre staff will be more than pleased to help!)
Antibiotic regimens Adhere to local guidelines. BNF examples include:
• Appendicectomy; colorectal resections and open biliary surgery:A single
dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h or gentamicin 1.5mg/kg + metronidazole
500mg or co-amoxiclav 1.2g alone.
• Oesophageal or gastric surgery: 1 dose of IV gentamicin or piperacillin/tazo-
bactam or co-amoxiclav (doses as for appendicectomy).
• Vascular surgery: 1 dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam or fl ucloxacillin 1–2g +
gentamicin. Add metronidazole if risk of anaerobes (eg amputations, gangrene,
or diabetes).
• MRSA: For high-risk patients add teicoplanin or vancomycin to the above-listed
regimens.
Table 13.1 Classifi cation of surgical procedures and wound infection risk
Category Description Infection risk
Clean Incising uninfected skin without opening a viscus <2%
Clean-contaminated Intra-operative breach of a viscus (but not colon) 8–10%
Contaminated Breach of a viscus + spillage or opening of colon 12–20%
Dirty The site is already contaminated with pus or 25%

Sutures
Sutures are central to the art of surgery. No single suture fi ts the bill for every
occasion, and so suture selection (including size) depends on the job in hand (see
tables 13.2, 13.3). In their broadest sense they are absorbable or non-absorbable,
synthetic or natural, and their structure may be divided into monofi lament, twisted,
or braided. Monofi lament sutures are quite slippery but minimize infection and pro-
duce less reaction. Braided sutures have plaited strands and provide secure knots,
but they may allow infection to occur in surrounding tissue between their strands.
Twisted sutures have 2 twisted strands and similar qualities to braided sutures. Sizes
are denoted according to a scale running down from #5 (heavy braided suture). Most
common modern sutures are smaller than size #0, hence rising numbers with a -0
suffi x correspond to progressively fi ner grades of suture up to 11–0 (fi ne ophthalmic
monofi laments). 3–0 or 4–0 are the best sizes for skin closure. Timing of suture re-
moval depends on site and the general health of the patient. Face and neck sutures
may be removed after 5d (earlier in children), scalp and back of neck after 5d, ab-
dominal incisions and proximal limbs (including clips) after ~10d, distal extremities
after 14d. In patients with poor wound healing, eg steroids, malignancy, infection,
cachexia (p35), the elderly, or smokers, sutures may need ~14d.

Surgical drains in the post-operative period
The decision when to insert and remove drains may seem to be one of the great
surgical enigmas—but there are basically three types to get a grip of:
1 To drain the area of surgery and are often put under suction or Ωve pressure
(Redivac® uses a ‘high vacuum’). These are removed when they stop draining.
They protect against collection, haematoma, and seroma formation(in breast
surgery this can cause overlying skin necrosis).
2 To protect sites where leakage may occur in post-operative period, eg bowel
anastomoses. These form a tract and are removed after about 1wk.
3 To collect red blood cells from the site of the operation, which can then be
autotransfused within 6h, protecting from the hazards of allotransfusion—it
is used commonly in orthopaedics. (eg Bellovac®).
‘Shortening a drain’ means withdrawing it (eg by 2cm/d) to allow the tract to
seal, bit by bit. Check the surgeon’s wishes before altering a drain. If a drain
‘falls out’ on the ward, avoid re-siting it because it is now covered in skin fl ora.
Put a collecting bag over the wound and contact surgical registrar.

Anaesthesia
Before anaesthesia, explain to the patient what will happen and where they will
wake up, otherwise the recovery room or ITU will be frightening. Explain that they
may feel ill on waking. The premedication aims to allay anxiety and to make the
anaesthesia itself easier to conduct (see BOX). Typical regimens might include:
• Anxiolytics: Benzodiazepines, eg lorazepam 2mg PO; temazepam 10–20mg PO. In
children, use oral premeds as fi rst choice, eg midazolam 0.5mg/kg (tastes bitter so
often put in paracetamol suspension). Give oral premedication 2h before surgery
(1h if IM route used).
• Analgesics: See p574. Pre-emptive analgesia is not often used and eff ects are hard
to determine. The aim is to dampen pain signals before they arrive. In children or
anxious adults, local anaesthetic cream may be used on a few sites before inserting
an IVI (the anaesthetist may prefer to site the cannula themselves!).
• Anti-emetics: Post-operative nausea and vomiting is experienced by ~25% of
all patients. 5HT3 antagonists (eg ondansetron 4mg IV/IM) are the most eff ective
agents; others, eg metoclopramide 10mg/8h IV/IM/PO, are also used—see p251.
• Antacids: Ranitidine 50mg IV or omeprazole 40mg PO/IV if aspiration risk.
• Antisialogues: Glycopyrronium (200–400mcg in adults, 4–8mcg/kg in children;
given IV/IM 30–60min before induction) is sometimes used to decrease secretions
that may cause respiratory obstruction in smaller airways.
• Antibiotics: See p570.
Side-eff ects of anaesthetic agents
• Hyoscine, atropine: Anticholinergic,  tachycardia, urinary retention, glaucoma,
sedation (especially in the elderly).
• Opioids: Respiratory depression, cough refl ex, nausea and vomiting, constipation.
• Thiopental: (Induction agent.) Laryngospasm.
• Propofol: (Induction agent.) Respiratory/cardiac depression, pain on injection.
• Volatile agents, eg isofl urane: Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respira-
tory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF).
The complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of:
• Pain sensation: Urinary retention, pressure necrosis, local nerve injuries (eg radial
nerve palsy from arm hanging over the table edge).
• Consciousness: Cannot communicate ‘wrong leg/kidney’. NB: in some patients (eg
0.15%) retained consciousness is the problem. Awareness under GA sounds like a
contradiction of terms, but remember that anaesthesia is a process rather than an
event. Such awareness can lead to ill-defi ned, delayed neuroses and post-traumatic
stress disorder (OHCS p353).
• Muscle power: Corneal abrasion ( tape the eyes closed), no respiration, no cough
(leads to pneumonia and atelectasis—partial lung collapse causing shunting ± im-
paired gas exchange: it starts minutes after induction, and may be related to the
use of 100% O2, supine position, surgery, age, and to loss of power).
Local/regional anaesthesia If unfi t/unwilling to undergo general anaesthesia, lo-
cal nerve blocks (eg brachial plexus) or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagula-
tion, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be
indicated. See table 13.4 for doses and toxicity eff ects.
Drugs complicating anaesthesia Inform anaesthetist. See p566 for lists of spe-
cifi c drugs, and actions to take.
Malignant hyperpyrexia This is a rare complication, precipitated by any volatile
agent, eg halothane, or suxamethonium. It exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance.
There is a rapid rise in temperature (>1°C every 30min); masseter spasm may be an
early sign. Complications include hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, hyperkalaemia, meta-
bolic acidosis, and arrhythmias. Get expert help immediately. Prompt treatment
with dantrolene3 (skeletal muscle relaxant), active cooling and ITU care can reduce
mortality signifi cantly.
3 Give 1mg/kg every 5min IV—up to 10mg/kg in total (OHCS p628).

Principles and practical conduct of anaesthesia
Hypnosis Analgesia
Muscle relaxation
Fig 13.4 Principles of anaesthesia.
The conduct of anaesthesia (fi g 13.4) typically involves:
• Induction: Either intravenous (eg propofol 1.5–2.5mg/kg IV at a rate of 20–40mg
every 10s; thiopental is an alternative) or, if airway obstruction or diffi cult IV ac-
cess, gaseous (eg sevofl urane or nitrous oxide, mixed in O2).
• Airway control: Either using a facemask, an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway or
by intubation. The latter usually requires muscle relaxation with a depolarizing/
non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (OHCS p622).
• Maintenance of anaesthesia: Either a volatile agent added to NO/O mixture,
2 2
or high-dose opiates with mechanical ventilation, or IV infusion anaesthesia (eg
propofol 4–12mg/kg/h IVI).
• Recovery: Change inspired gases to 100% oxygen only, then discontinue any an-
aesthetic infusions and reverse muscle paralysis. Extubate once spontaneously
breathing, place patient in recovery position, and give oxygen by facemask.
• For further details, see the Anaesthesia chapter in OHCS (p612).
 Local anaesthetic toxicity and maximum doses
Anaesthetists are masters of the drug dose by weight! It is important to remem-
ber the maximum doses for local anaesthetics, not least because we use them so
frequently, but because the eff ects of overdose can be lethal.
Handy to remember (though it can be worked out with a pen, paper, and SI
units) is that a 1% concentration is equivalent to 10mg/mL. Local anaesthetics are
also basic, and so do not work well in acidic environments, eg abscesses.
Table 13.4 Example of maximum doses for local anaesthetic
Lidocaine concn Approx. allowable Approx. allowable volume
% concn
(mg/mL) volume (mL/kg) for 70kg adult (mL)
0.25% 2.5 1.12 ≤80
0.5% 5 0.56 ≤40
1% 10 0.28 ≤20
2% 20 0.14 ≤10
Local anaesthetic toxicity starts with peri-oral tingling and paraesthesiae, pro-
gressing to drowsiness, seizures, coma, and cardiorespiratory arrest. If suspected
(the patient feels ‘funny’ and develops early signs) then stop administration im-
mediately and commence ABC resuscitation as required. Treatment is with lipid
emulsion. Find out where this is stored in your hospital.

The control of pain
Humans are the most exquisite devices ever made for experiencing pain:the rich er
our inner lives, the greater the varieties of pain there are for us to feel, and the more
resources we have for dealing with pain. If we can connect with patients’ in ner lives
we may make a real diff erence.Never forget how painful pain is, nor how fear mag-
nifi es pain. Try not to let these sensations, so often interposed between your patient
and recovery, be invisible to you as he or she bravely puts up with them.
Approach to management (fi g 13.5 and p532.) Review and chart each pain carefully
and individually.
• Identify and treat the underlying pathology wherever possible.
• Give regular doses rather than on an ‘as-required’ basis.
• Choose the best route: PO, PR, IM, epidural, SC, inhalation, or IV.
• Explanation and reassurance contribute greatly to analgesia.
• Allow the patient to be in charge. This promotes wellbeing, and does not lead to
overuse. Patient-controlled continuous IV morphine delivery systems are useful.
• Liaise with the Acute Pain Service, if possible.
Non-narcotic (simple) analgesia Paracetamol 0.5–1.0g/4h PO (up to 4g daily; 15mg/
kg/4h IV over 15min in children <50kg; up to 60mg/kg/d). Caution in liver impair-
ment. NSAIDS, eg ibuprofen 400mg/8h PO (see BNFC for dosing in children) are good
for musculoskeletal pain and renal or biliary colic. CI: peptic ulcer, clotting disorders,
anticoagulants. Cautions: asthma, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, IHD,
pregnancy, and the elderly. Aspirin is contraindicated in children due to the risk of
Reye’s syndrome (OHCS p652).
Opioid drugs for severe pain Morphine (eg 10–15mg/2–4h IV/IM) or diamor phine
(5–10mg/2–4h PO, SC, or slow IV, but you may need much more) are best. NB: these
are ‘controlled’ drugs. For palliative care, see p532. Alternative delivery routes in-
clude transdermal (once baseline requirements are established) or sublingual.
Side-effects of opioids: These include nausea (so give with an anti-emetic, p251),
respiratory depression, constipation, cough suppression, urinary retention, BP, and
sedation (do not use in hepatic failure or head injury). Dependency is rarely a prob-
lem. Naloxone (eg 100–200mcg IV, followed by 100mcg increments, eg every 2min
until responsive) may be needed to reverse the eff ects of excess opioids (p842).
Epidural analgesia Opioids and anaesthetics are given into the epidural space by
infusion or as boluses. Ask the advice of the Pain Service. SES are thought to be less,
as the drug is more localized: watch for respiratory depression and local anaesthetic-
induced autonomic blockade (BP).
Adjuvant treatments Eg radiotherapy for bone cancer pain; anticonvulsants, an-
tidepressants, gabapentin or steroids for neuropathic pain, antispasmodics, eg hy-
oscine butylbromide4 (Buscopan® 10–20mg/8h PO/IM/IV) for intestinal or renal tract
colic. If brief pain relief is needed (eg for changing dressings or exploring wounds),
try inhaled nitrous oxide (with 50% O2—as Entonox®) with an ‘on-demand’ valve.
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), local heat, local or regional an-
aesthesia, and neurosurgical procedures (eg excision of neuroma) may be tried but
can prove disappointing. Treat conditions that exacerbate pain (eg constipation,
depression, anxiety).
4 Not to be confused with hyoscine hydrobromide; used for drying secretions and in motion sickness.

General post-operative complications
Pyrexia Mild pyrexia in the 1st 48h is often from atelectasis (needs prompt physio,
not antibiotics), tissue damage/necrosis, or even from blood transf usions, but still have
a low threshold for infection screen. Consider evidence for peritonism, chest, urinary,
wound, or cannula site infections, as well as possible endocarditis, meningism, or DVT
(also causes °T). Send blood for FBC, U&E, CRP, and cultures (±LFT). Dipstick the urine.
Consider MSU, CXR, and abdominal ultrasound/CT depending on clinical fi ndings.
Confusion may manifest as agitation, disorientation, and attempts to leave hospital,
especially at night. Gently reassure the patient in well-lit surroundings. See p484 for
a full work-up. Common causes are:
• hypoxia (pneumonia, atelectasis, LVF, PE) • infection (see earlier)
• drugs (opiates, sedatives, and many others) • alcohol withdrawal (p280)
• urinary retention • liver/renal failure.
• MI or stroke
Occasionally, sedation is necessary to examine the patient; consider lorazepam 1mg
PO/IM (antidote: fl umazenil) or haloperidol 0.5–2mg IM. Reassure relatives that post-
op confusion is common (seen in up to 40%) and reversible.
Dyspnoea or hypoxia Any previous lung disease? Sit patient up and give O2, m onitor
peripheral O2 sats by pulse oximetry (p162). Examine for evidence of: •pneum onia,
pulmonary collapse, or aspiration •LVF (MI; fl uid overload) •pulmonary embolism
(p190) •pneumothorax (p190; due to CVP line, intercostal block, or mechanical ventila-
tion). Tests: FBC; ABG; CXR; ECG. Manage according to fi ndings.
BP If severe, tilt bed head-down and give O2. Check pulse and BP yourself; compare
it with pre-op values. Post-op BP is often from hypovolaemia resulting from inad-
equate fl uid input, so check fl uid chart and replace losses. Monitor urine output
(may need catheterization). A CVP line can help monitor fl uid resuscitation (normal
is 0–5cmH2O relative to sternal angle). Hypovolaemia may also be caused by haem-
orrhage so review wounds, drains, and abdomen. If unstable, return to theatre for
haemostasis. Beware cardiogenic and neurogenic causes and look for evidence of MI
or PE. Consider sepsis and anaphylaxis. Management: p790.
BP may be from pain, urinary retention, idiopathic hypertension (eg missed medi-
cation), or inotropic drugs. Oral cardiac medications (including antihypertensives)
should be continued throughout the perioperative period even if NBM. Treat the
cause, consider increasing the regular medication, or if not absorbing orally try 50mg
labetalol IV over 1min (see p140).
Urine output (oliguria) Aim for output of >30mL/h in adults (or >0.5mL/kg/h).
Anuria may refl ect a blocked or malsited catheter (see p763) rather than AKI. Flush
or replace catheter. Oliguria is usually due to too little replacement of lost fl uid. Treat
by increasing fl uid input. Acute kidney injury may follow shock, drugs, transfusion,
pancreatitis, or trauma (see p300 for classifi cation and management of AKI).
• Review fl uid chart and examine for signs of volume depletion.
• Urinary retention is also common, so examine for a palpable bladder.
• Establish normovolaemia (a CVP line may help); you may need 1L/h IVI for 2–3h. A
‘fl uid challenge’ of 250–500mL over 30min may also help.
• Catheterize bladder (for accurate monitoring)—see p762; check U&E.
• If intrinsic renal failure is suspected, stop nephrotoxic drugs (eg NSAIDS, ACE-i) and
refer to a nephrologist early.
Nausea/vomitingAny mechanical obstruction,ileus,or emetic drugs (opiates,dig -
oxin, anaesthetics)? Consider AXR, NGT, and an anti-emetic (not metoclopramide
because of its prokinetic property).See p251 for choice of anti-emetics.
Na+ Pre-op level? Excess IV fl uids may exacerbate the situation. Correct slowly
(p672). SIADH (p673) can be precipitated by pain, nausea, opioids, and chest infection.

Post-operative bleeding
Primary haemorrhage: Continuous bleeding, starting during surgery. Replace
blood loss. If severe, return to theatre for adequate haemostasis. Treat shock
vigorously (p790–804).
Reactive haemorrhage: Haemostasis appears secure until BP rises and bleeding
starts. Replace blood and re-explore wound.
Secondary haemorrhage (caused by infection) occurs 1–2wks post-op.
Talking about post-op complications…
When asked to give your thoughts on the complications of an operation—maybe
with an examiner or a patient—a good starting point is to divide them up accord-
ingly (and for each of the following stratify as immediate, early, and late):
• From the anaesthetic: (p572.) Eg respiratory depression from induction agents.
• From surgery in general: (p576.) Eg wound infection, haemorrhage, neurovas-
cular damage, DVT/PE.
• From the specifi c procedure: Eg saphenous nerve damage in stripping of the
long varicose vein.
Tailor the discussion towards the individual who, eg if an arteriopath, may have a
signifi cant risk of cardiac ischaemia during hypotensive episodes while under the
anaesthetic. For some other post-op complications, see:
• Pain (p574) • DVT (p578) • Pulmonary embolus (p190; massive, p818) • Wound de-
hiscence (p580) • Complications in post-gastric surgery (p622) • Other complica-
tions of specifi c operations (p580).

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
DVTS occur in 25–50% of surgical patients, and many non-surgical patients. All hospi-
tal inpatients should be assessed for DVT/PE risk and off ered prophylaxis if appropri-
ate. 65% of below-knee DVTs are asymptomatic; these rarely embolize to the lung.
Risk factors Age, pregnancy, synthetic oestrogen, trauma, surgery (especially pel-
vic/orthopaedic), past DVT, cancer, obesity, immobility, thrombophilia (p374).
Signs •Calf warmth/tenderness/swelling/erythema. •Mild fever. •Pitting oedema.
 Cellulitis; ruptured Baker’s cyst. Both may coexist with a DVT.
Tests Calculate Wells score (see table 13.5) before ordering D-dimer. D-dimer is sen-
sitive but not specifi c for DVT (also  in infection, pregnancy, malignancy, and post-op).
Wells score: ≤1 point = DVT unlikely: Perform D-dimer. If negative, DVT excluded.
If positive, proceed to USS (if USS negative, DVT excluded; if positive, treat as DVT).
≥2 points = DVT likely: Do D-dimer and USS. If both negative, DVT excluded. If USS posi-
tive, treat as DVT. If D-dimer positive and USS negative, repeat USS in 1 week.
Do thrombophilia tests (p374) before commencing anticoagulant therapy if there
are no predisposing factors, in recurrent DVT, or if DVT in unusual site. Look for un-
derlying malignancy: Urine dip; FBC, LFT, Ca2+; CXR ± CT abdomen/pelvis (and mam-
mography in ) if >40yrs.
Prevention •Stop the oral contraceptive pill 4wks pre-op. •Mobilize early. •LMWH eg
enoxaparin 20mg/24h SC,  to 40mg for high-risk patients (p375) (caution if eGFR less
than 30mL/min/1.73m2). •Graduated compression stockings (‘thromboembolic deter-
rent (TED) stockings’; CI: ischaemia) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices
 risk of DVT by ~70% in surgical patients.•Fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor)  risk
of DVT over LMWH in eg major orthopaedic surgery without  risk of bleeding.
Treatment LMWH (eg enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/24h SC) or fondaparinux. LMWH is superi-
or to unfractionated heparin (used in renal failure or if risk of bleeding; dose guided
by APTT, p350). Cancer patients should receive LMWH for 6 months (then review). In
others, start warfarin simultaneously with LMWH (warfarin is prothrombotic for the
fi rst 48h). Stop heparin when INR is 2–3; treat for 3 months in most (longer in some
cases—see p351). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS p190), eg dabigatan, apixaban,
rivoraxaban, are newer alternatives licensed for the treatment of DVT with benefi ts
relating to simpler dosing and monitoring and  bleeding risk. Inferior vena caval
fi lters may be used in active bleeding, or when anticoagulants fail, to minimize risk of
PE. Post-phlebitic change (pain, swelling, and skin changes) can be seen in 10–30%—
graduated compression stockings may help.
Pretest clinical probability scoring for DVT: the Wells score
In patients with symptoms in both legs, the more symptomatic leg is used.
Table 13.5 Wells score
Clinical features Score
Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) 1 point
Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of leg 1 point
Recently bedridden for >3d or majory surgery in last 12wks 1 point
Local tenderness along distribution of deep venous system 1 point
Entire leg swollen 1 point
Calf swelling >3cm compared with asymptomatic leg (measured 1 point
10cm below tibial tuberosity)
Pitting oedema (greater in the symptomatic leg) 1 point
Collateral superfi cial veins (non-varicose) 1 point
Previously documented DVT 1 point
Alternative diagnosis at least as likely as DVT Ω2 points

Swollen legs
Bilateral oedema implies systemic disease with venous pressure (eg right heart
failure) or intravascular oncotic pressure (any cause of albumin, so test the urine
for protein). It is dependent (distributed by gravity), which is why legs are aff ected
early, but severe oedema extends above the legs. In the bed-bound, fl uid moves to
the new dependent area, causing a sacral pad. The exception is the local increase
in venous pressure occurring in IVC obstruction: the swelling neither extends above
the legs nor redistributes. Causes: •Right heart failure (p134). •Albumin (p686, eg
renal or liver failure). •Venous insuffi ciency: acute, eg prolonged sitting, or chronic,
with haemosiderin-pigmented, itchy, eczematous skin ± ulcers. •Vaso dilators, eg
nifedipine, amlodipine. •Pelvic mass (p57, p604). •Pregnancy—if BP + proteinuria,
diagnose pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48): fi nd an obstetrician urgently. In all the above,
both legs need not be aff ected to the same extent.
Unilateral oedema Pain ± redness implies DVT or infl ammation, eg cellulitis or in-
sect bites (any blisters?). Bone or muscle may be to blame, eg tumours; necrotizing
fasciitis (p660); trauma (check for sensation, pulses, and severe pain esp. on pas-
sive movement: a compartment syndrome with ischaemic necrosis needs prompt
fasciotomy). Impaired mobility suggests trauma, arthritis, or a Baker’s cyst (p694).
Non-pitting oedema is oedema you cannot indent: see p35.
Nine questions to ask
1 Is itb oth legs? 2 Is she pregnant? 3 Is she mobile?
4 Any trauma? 5 Any pitting (p35)? 6 Past diseases/on drugs?
7 Any pain? 8 Any skin changes? 9 Any oedema elsewhere?
Tests Look for proteinuria (+hypoalbuminaemia ≈nephrotic syndrome). CCF?
Treatment of leg oedema Treat the cause. Diuretics for all is not an answer. Elevat-
ing legs for dependent oedema (ankles higher than hips—do not just use footstools);
raise the foot of the bed. Graduated support stockings may help (CI: ischaemia).
Travel and DVT
Long-distance travel appears to be a risk factor for the development of venous
thromboembolism (VTE). Data suggests this is not confi ned to air travel, increases
with the duration of travel, and results in clinical thrombosis more often in travel-
lers with pre-existing risk factors. Dehydration, immobilization, decreased oxygen
tension, and prolonged sitting have all been suggested as contributory factors.
The risk of developing a DVT from a long-distance fl ight has been estimated at 1 in
10 000 to 1 in 40 000 for the general population.
• The incidence of DVT in high-risk groups has been shown to be 4–6% for fl ights
>10h. Travellers with ≥1 risk factor should consider compression stockings. For
high-risk individuals consider a single dose of prophylactic LMWH for fl ights >6h.
• There is risk of PE associated with long-distance air travel.
• Compression stockings may  risk of DVT.
• There is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic aspirin.
• Risk reduction measures: leg exercises, increased water intake, and refraining
from alcohol or caff eine during the journey.

Specifi c post-operative complications
Laparotomy Wound may break down from a few days to a few weeks post-op
(incidence ≈ 3.5%). Particular risk in the elderly, malnourished (eg cancer, IBD), if
infection, uraemia, or haematoma is present, or in repeat laparotomies. Warning
sign is a pink serous discharge. Always assume the defect involves the whole of the
wound. Wound dehiscence may lead to a ‘burst abdomen’ with eviscera tion of bowel
(mortality 15–30%). If you are on the ward when this happens, call your senior, put
the viscera back into the abdomen, place a sterile dressing over the wound, and
give IV antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam; see local guidelines). Allay anxiety,
give parenteral pain control, set up an IVI, and return patient to theatre. Incisional
hernia is a common late problem (20%), repairable by mesh insertion (if necessary).
Biliary surgery Early: Iatrogenic bile duct injury, cholangitis, bile leakage, bleeding
into the biliary tree (haemobilia—may lead to melaena or haematemesis); pancreatitis.
Retained stones may be removed by ERCP (p742); if this is not available a ‘T-tube’ left
in the bile duct at the time of closure allows free drainage to the exterior; unrelieved
distal obstruction of the bile duct may result in fi stula formation and chronic leakage
of bile. If jaundiced, maintain a good urine output, monitor coagulation, and consider
antibiotics. Late: Bile duct stricture; post-cholecystectomy syndrome (symptoms aris-
ing from alterations in bile fl ow due to loss of the reservoir function of the gallbladder).
Thyroid surgery Early: Recurrent (± superior) laryngeal nerve palsy (hoarseness)
can occur permanently in 0 . 5% and transiently in 1 . 5%—warn the patient that their
voice will be different for a few days post-op because of intubation and local oedema
(NB: pre-operative fi breoptic laryngoscopy should be performed to exclude pre-exist-
ing vocal cord dysfunction); thyroid storm (symptoms of severe hypert hyroidism—see
p834); tracheal obstruction due to haematoma in the wound: relieve by immedi-
ate removal of stitches or clips using the cutter/remover that should remain at the
beside; may require urgent surgery; hypoparathyroidism (p222); check plasma Ca2+
daily; transient drops in serum concentration are common, permanent in 2 . 5%. Late:
Hypothyroidism; recurrent hyperthyroidism.
Mastectomy Arm lymphoedema in up to 20% of those undergoing axillary node
sampling or dissection. The risk of lymphoedema increases with the level of axillary
dissection: risk is lower with level 1 dissection (remains inferior to pec. minor) com-
pared to level 3 dissection (goes superior to pec. minor, rarely done); skin necrosis.
Arterial surgery Bleeding; thrombosis; embolism; graft infection; MI; AV fi stula
formation. Complications of aortic surgery: Gut ischaemia; renal failure; respira-
tory distress; trauma to ureters or anterior spinal artery (leading to paraplegia);
ischaemic events from distal emboli from dislodged thrombus; aorto-enteric fi stula.
Colonic surgery Early: Sepsis;ileus;fi stulae;anastomotic leak (11% for radical rectal
surgery); haemorrhage; trauma to ureters or spleen. Late: Adhesional obstruction (BOX).
Small bowel surgery Short gut syndrome (best defi ned functionally, as ma-
labsorption due to insuffi cient residual small bowel; adults with 150cm at risk).
Diarrhoea and malabsorption (particularly of fats) lead to a number of metabolic
abnormalities including defi ciency in vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, hyper oxaluria (causing
renal stones), and bile salt depletion (causing gallstones). The management of short
bowel syndrome is complex, aiming to correct metabolic abnormalities, optimize
residual bowel function, and support nutrition (using parenteral route if necessary).
Tracheostomy Mediastinitis; surgical emphysema. Later: stenosis.
Splenectomy (p373.) Acute gastric dilatation (a serious consequence of not using a
NGT, or to check that the one in place is working); thrombocytosis; sepsis. Lifetime
sepsis risk is partly preventable with pre-op vaccines—ie Haemophilus type B,
meningococcal, and pneumococcal(p407 & p167)and prophylactic penicillin.
Genitourinary surgery Septicaemia (from instrumentation in the presence of in-
fected urine)—consider a stat dose of gentamicin; urinoma—rupture of a ureter or
renal pelvis leading to a mass of extravasated urine.
Gastrectomy See p622. Prostatectomy p642. Haemorrhoidectomy p632.

Adhesions—legacy of the laparotomy, bane of the surgeon
When re-operating on the abdomen, the struggle against adhesions tests the
farthest and darkest boundaries of patience of the abdominal surgeon and the
assistant. The skill and persistence required to gently and atraumatically tease
apart these fi brous bands that restrict access and vision makes any progression,
no matter how slight, cause for subdued celebration. Perseverance is the name
of this game.
Surgical division of adhesions is known as adhesiolysis. Any surgical procedure
that breaches the abdominal or pelvic cavities can predispose to the formation
of adhesions, which are found in up to 90% of those with previous abdominal
surgery; this is why we do not rush to operate on small bowel obstruction: the op-
eration predisposes to yet more adhesions. Handling of the serosal surface of the
bowel causes infl ammation, which over weeks to years can lead to the formation
of fi brous bands that tether the bowel to itself or adjacent structures—though
adhesions can also form secondary to infection, radiation injury, and infl ammatory
processes such as Crohn’s disease. Their main sequelae are intestinal obstruction
(the cause in ~60% of cases—see p610) and chronic abdominal or pelvic pain. Stud-
ies have shown that adhesiolysis may help relieve chronic pain, though for a small
proportion of patients the pain never improves or even worsens after directed
intervention.
As far as prevention is concerned, the best approach is to avoid operating; lapa-
roscopy compared with laparotomy reduces the rate of local adhesions. Insertion
of synthetic fi lms (eg hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl membrane) to prevent adhe-
sions to the anterior abdominal wall reduces incidence, extent, and severity of
adhesions, but not incidence of obstruction or operative re-intervention.

Stoma care
A stoma (Greek=mouth) is an artifi cial union between a conduit and the outside
world—eg a colostomy, in which faeces are made to pass through an opening in the
abdominal wall when a loop of colon is brought out onto the skin. NB: a stoma can
also be made between two internal conduits (eg a choledochojejunostomy).
Colostomies (Usually left illiac fossa and fl ush with the skin—fi g 13.8.) May be tem-
porary or permanent. Are they suitable for a laparoscopic operation?
• Loop colostomy: A loop of colon is exteriorized and partially divided, forming two
stomas that are joined together (the proximal end passes stool, the distal end passes
mucus, see fi g 13.6). A rod under the loop prevents retraction and may be removed
after 7d. A loop colostomy is often temporary and performed to protect a distal
anastomosis, eg after anterior resection.
• End colostomy: The bowel is divided and the proximal end brought out as a stoma;
the distal end may be: 1 resected, eg abdominoperineal (AP) resection (inspect the
perineum for absent anus when examining a stoma) 2 closed and left in the abdo-
men (Hartmann’s procedure) 3 exteriorized, forming a ‘mucous fi stula’.
• Paul–Mikulicz colostomy: A double-barrelled colostomy in which the colon is di-
vided completely (eg to excise a section of bowel). Each end is exteriorized as two
separate stomas.
Output: Colostomies ideally pass 1–2 formed motions/day into an adherent plastic
pouch. Some may be managed with irrigation, thus avoiding a pouch.
Incidence: 21 000 stomas/yr in UK (>50% are permanent). Most manage their stomas
well. The cost for appliances is ~£1500/yr. If there is a skin reaction to the adhesive
or pouch, a change of device may be all that is needed. Contact the stoma nurse.
Ileostomies (Usually right illiac fossa.) Protrude from the skin and emit frequent
fl uid motions which contain active enzymes (so the skin needs protecting—see fi g
13.7). Loop ileostomies can be formed to defunction the colon as a temporary meas-
ure eg during control of diffi cult perianal Crohn’s disease. End ileostomy follows total
or subtotal c olectomy, eg for UC; subsequent formation of ileal pouch-anal anasto-
mosis (pouch of ileum is joined to the upper anal canal) can allow for stoma reversal.
Alternative (non-stoma forming) surgery Low/ultralow anterior resection: All
or part of the rectum is excised and the proximal colon anastomosed to the top of the
anal canal (the lower the level of anastomosis, the higher the risk of complication).
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: Allows excision of small tumours within the
rectum with preservation of sphincter function.
Urostomies are fashioned after total cystectomy, bringing urine from the ureters
to the abdominal wall via an ileal conduit that is usually incontinent. Formation of
a catheterizable valvular mechanism may retain continence. Advances in urological
surgery have seen an increase in continence-saving procedures such as orthotopic
neobladder reconstruction, with good long-term continence rates.
When choosing a stoma site, avoid:
• Bony prominences (eg anterior superior iliac spine, costal margins).
• The umbilicus.
• Old wounds/scars—there may be adhesions beneath.
• Skin folds and creases.
• The waistline.
• The site should be assessed pre-operatively by the stoma nurse, with the patient
both lying and standing.

Complications of stomas
Liaise early with the stoma nurse, starting pre-operatively.
Early:
• Haemorrhage at stoma site.
• Stoma ischaemia—colour progresses from dusky grey to black.
• High output (can lead to K+)—consider loperamide ± codeine to thicken output.
• Obstruction secondary to adhesions (see p581).
• Stoma retraction.
Delayed:
• Obstruction (failure at operation to close lateral space around stoma).
• Dermatitis around stoma site (worse with ileostomy).
• Stoma prolapse.
• Stomal intussusception.
• Stenosis.
• Parastomal hernia (risk increases with time). NB: prophylactic mesh insertion at
the time of stoma formation reduces this risk.
• Fistulae.
• Psychological problems.
Psychological aspects of stoma care
The physical and psychological aspects of stoma care must not be undervalued. Be
alert to any vicious cycle in which a skin reaction leads to leakage and precipitates
a fear of going out, or a fear of eating. This in turn may lead to poor nutrition and
further skin reactions, resulting in further leakage and depression. These cycles
can be circumvented by the stoma nurse, who is the expert in fi tting secure,
odourless devices and providing patients with a wealth of physical and psycho-
logical support, both pre and post operative (explaining what is going to happen,
what the stoma will be like, and troubleshooting post-op problems). Early refer-
ral prevents problems. Without input from the stoma nurse, a patient may reject
their colostomy, never attend to it, and develop deep-seated psychological and
psychiatric problems.

nent mucosal folds, and is often right-sided.

Nutritional support in hospital
Over 25% of hospital inpatients may be malnourished. Hospitals can become so
focused on curing disease that they ignore the foundations of good health—mal-
nourished patients recover more slowly and experience more complications. See
table 13.6.
Why are so many hospital patients malnourished?
1 Increased nutritional requirements (eg sepsis, burns, surgery).
2 Increased nutritional losses (eg malabsorption, output from stoma).
3 Decreased intake (eg dysphagia, nausea, sedation, coma).
4 Eff ect of treatment (eg nausea, diarrhoea).
5 Enforced starvation (eg prolonged periods nil by mouth).
6 Missing meals (eg due to investigations—minimize meal time disruption).
7 Diffi culty with feeding(eg lost dentures;no one available to assist).
8 Unappetizing food.
Identifying at-risk patients Assess nutrition state (using eg Malnutrition Univer-
sal Screening Tool3) and weight on admission; reassess weekly thereafter. Involve
dieticians early in those at risk.
• History: Recent weight (>20%, accounting for fl uid balance); recent reduced in-
take; diet change (eg recent change in consistency of food); nausea, vomiting, pain,
diarrhoea which might have led to reduced intake.
• Examination: State of hydration (p666): dehydration can go hand-in-hand with
malnutrition, and overhydration can mask malnutrition. Evidence of malnutrition:
skin hanging off muscles (eg over biceps); no fat between fold of skin; hair rough
and wiry; pressure sores; sores at corner of mouth. Calculate body mass index
(p244); BMI <18.5kg/m2 suggests malnouri shment. Anthropomorphic indices, eg
mid-arm circumference, skin fold measures, and grip strength are also used.
• Investigations: Generally unhelpful. Low albumin suggestive, but is aff ected by
many things other than nutrition. Albumin can be helpful in monitoring recovery.
Enteral nutrition (Ie nutrition given into gastrointestinal tract.) If at all possible,
give nutrition by mouth. An all-fl uid diet can meet requirements (but get advice from
dietician). If danger of choking or aspiration (eg after stroke), consider semi-solid
diet. Early post-op enteral nutrition has been shown to benefi t patients (eg after GI
surgery) and may reduce complications. Tube feeding: Liquid nutrition via a tube:
Nasogastric typically placed without guidance (p759); nasojejunal tubes require en-
doscopic placement (used if gastric outlet obstruction, delayed gastric emptying,
post-gastrectomy, or pancreatitis). Alternatively, gastric or jejunal tubes may be in-
serted radiologically or surgically (ie gastrostomy/jejunostomy). Use for nutritionally
complete, commercially prepared feeds. Close liaison with a dietician is essential.
Polymeric feeds consist of undigested proteins, starches, and long-chain fatty acids
(eg Nutrison standard®, Osmolite®). Normally contain ~1kCal/mL and 4–6g protein
per 100mL. Typical requirements met with 2L/24h. Elemental feeds consist of indi-
vidual amino acids, oligo- and monosaccharides needing minimal digestion. Feed is
typically initiated at a slow, continuous rate (nausea and vomiting less problematic)
but patients may build up to shorter, bolus feeds, freeing them from pumps between.
Guidelines for success
• Use fi ne-bore (9Fr) nasogastric feeding tube when possible.
• Check position of nasogastric tube (pH testing) b efore starting feeding (p759); the
positioning of a nasojejunal tube can be checked on abdominal X-ray.
• Build up feeds gradually to avoid diarrhoea and distension.
• Weigh at least weekly.
• Check blood glucose and plasma electrolytes (monitor for refeeding syndrome if
previously malnourished—p587).
• Treat underlying conditions vigorously, eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance.

Nil by mouth (NBM) before theatre
If in doubt about what is acceptable oral intake prior to induction for general
anaesthesia (eg for GI surgery), it is best to liaise with the anaesthetist concerned.
However, guidelines have been published by many colleges and societies to outline
what is safe in the perioperative period:
• For adult elective surgery in healthy patients without GI comorbidity:
• Water or clear fl uids (eg black tea/coff ee) are allowed up to 2h beforehand.
• All other intake up to 6h beforehand.
• In emergency surgery, ≥6h NBM prior to theatre is best—but poor scheduling of
an emergency list is not an excuse for starving patients for days.
Table 13.6 Daily energy and nutritional requirements
Substance Requirement (/kg/d) Notes
Energy 20–40kCal Normal adult requirements will be
2000–2500kCal/d; even catabolic patients
rarely require >2500kCal/d.
84–168kJ Multiply kCal by a factor of 4.2.
Nitrogen 0.2–0.4g 6.25g of enteral protein gives 1g of nitrogen.
Considering nitrogen balance is important
because although catabolism is inevitable,
replenishment is vital.
Protein 0.5g Contains 5kCal/g.
Fat 3g Contains 10kCal/g.
Carbohydrate 2g Contains 4kCal/g.
Water 25–30mL +500mL/d for each °C of pyrexia.
Na/K/Cl 1.0mmol each Electrolytes need to be considered, even if
not on IVI.

Parenteral (intravenous) nutrition
Do not undertake parenteral feeding lightly: it has risks. Specialist advice is vital.
It should only be considered if the patient is likely to become malnourished with-
out it—this normally means that the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning (eg
bowel obstruction), and is unlikely to function for at least 7d. Parenteral feeding may
supplement other forms of nutrition (eg in short bowel syndrome or active Crohn’s
disease, when nutrition cannot be suffi ciently absorbed in the gut) or it can be used
alone (total parenteral nutrition—TPN). Even if there is GI disease, studies show that
enteral nutrition is safer, cheaper, and at least as effi cacious as parenteral nutrition
in the perioperative period.5
Administration Nutrition must be given via a dedicated central venous line (or
peripherally inserted central catheter—PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi-
lumen catheter (see fi gs 13.9 and 13.10).
Requirements There are many diff erent regimens for parenteral feeding. Most
provide 2000kCal and 10–14g nitrogen in 2–3L; this usually meets a patient’s daily
requirements (see table 13.6, p585). ~50% of calories are provided by fat and ~50%
by carbohydrate. Regimens comprise vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and elec-
trolytes; these will normally be included by the pharmacist.
Complications
• Sepsis: (eg Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus; Candida;
Pseudomonas; infective endocarditis.) Look for spiking pyrexia and examine
wound at tube insertion point. Stop PN, take line and peripheral cultures and give
antibiotics via the line. If central venous line-related sepsis is suspected, the safest
course of action is always to remove the line. Do not attempt to salvage a line when
Staph. aureus or Candida infection has been identifi ed.
• Thrombosis: Central vein thrombosis may occur, resulting in pulmonary embolus
or superior vena caval obstruction (p528).
• Metabolic imbalance: Electrolyte abnormalities—see BOX ‘Refeeding syndrome’;
deranged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; defi ciency syndromes (table 6.9, p268);
acid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production).
• Mechanical: Pneumothorax; embolism of IV line tip.
Guidelines for success
Liaise closely with line insertion team, nutrition team, and pharmacist.
• Meticulous sterility. Do not use central venous lines for uses other than nutrition.
Remove the line if you suspect infection. Culture its tip.
• Review fl uid balance at least twice daily, and requirements for energy and elec-
trolytes daily.
• Check weight, fl uid balance, and urine glucose daily during establishment of par-
enteral nutrition. Check plasma glucose, creatinine and electrolytes (including cal-
cium and phosphate), and FBC daily until stable. Check LFT and lipid clearance three
times a week until stable. Check zinc and magnesium weekly.
• Do not rush. Achieve the maintenance regimen in small steps.
• Treat underlying conditions vigorously—eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance.
5 Enteral feeding promotes integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin
translocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a sys-
temic infl ammatory response—even when the gut is not the primary source of pathology.

Refeeding syndrome
This is a life-threatening metabolic complication of refeeding via any route after
a prolonged period of starvation. At-risk patients include those initiating artifi cial
feeding (enteral or parenteral) after prolonged starvation, or with malignancy,
anorexia nervosa, or alcoholism. As the body turns to fat and protein metabolism
in the starved state, there is a drop in the level of circulating insulin (because of the
paucity of dietary carbohydrates). The catabolic state also depletes intracellular
stores of phosphate, although serum levels may remain normal (0.85–1.45mmol/L).
When refeeding begins, the level of insulin rises in response to the carbohydrate
load, and one of the consequences is to increase cellular uptake of phosphate.
A hypophosphataemic state (<0.50mmol/L) normally develops within 4d and is
mostly responsible for the features of ‘refeeding syndrome’, which include: rhab-
domyolysis; red and white cell dysfunction; respiratory insuffi ciency; arrhythmias;
cardiogenic shock; seizures; sudden death.
Prevention Give high-dose Pabrinex ® during re-feeding window. Identify at-risk
patients, assess and monitor closely during refeeding (glucose, lipids, sodium, po-
tassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc). Close involvement of a nutri-
tionist is required.
Treatment is of the complicating features and includes parenteral phosphate ad-
ministration (eg 18mmol/d) in addition to oral supplementation.
The venous system at the thoracic outlet
When trying to judge the position of a
central venous line tip on CXR (see fi g
13.10) it helps to know the anatomical
landmarks of the venous system (fi g
13.9). The subclavian veins join the inter-
nal jugular veins behind the sternoclav-
icular joints to form the brachiocephalic
veins. These come together behind the
right 1st sternocostal joint to form the
superior vena cava (SVC), which runs
from this point to the right 3rd sterno-
costal joint. The right atrium starts here. Fig 13.9 Neck veins.
Fig 13.10 Right arm PICC (peripherally inserted cen-
tral catheter) still with a wire in the lumen. This is a
radiograph at the time of insertion to determine if
placement is correct. The tip lies in the SVC—ie good
positioning for TPN or long-term antibiotic therapy.
The tip of a Hickman line, for cytotoxic administra-
tion, is better in the right atrium, to avoid possible
irritation of the SVC and consequent thrombosis or
stenosis. NB: this image was acquired in the angiog-
raphy room, where radio-opaque material appears
black (it is easier to see contrast media against a
white background). A similar eff ect may be achieved
by digitally inverting a standard X-ray.

Diabetic patients undergoing surgery
Over 10% of surgical patients will have diabetes. This group face a greater risk of post-
operative infection and cardiac complications. Tight glycaemic control is therefore
essential and improves outcome. Aim to achieve an HbA1C of <69mmol/mol prior to
elective surgery. Patients are often well informed about their diabetes—involve them
fully in managing their diabetic care. Check your hospital’s policy for managing dia-
betic patients who will be NBM before surgery. A general guide follows.
Insulin-treated diabetes mellitus
• Try to place the patient fi rst on the list in order to minimize the fasting period.
• Give all usual insulin the night before surgery.
• Long-acting (basal) insulin is usually continued at normal times (eg glargine; de-
temir), even when patients are on a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)—
previously known as a ‘sliding scale’ (see BOX).
• If on AM list, ensure no subcutaneous rapid-acting (bolus) or mixed insulin is given
on the morning of surgery. If PM list, give the normal morning bolus insulin, or half
the mixed insulin dose.
• If eating and drinking post-operatively, resume the usual insulin with evening meal.
If AM list (or early PM) and eating a late lunch, give half the morning insulin dose
with this meal. If not eating until evening, a VRIII may be needed if the capillary
glucose readings are high.
• Omit all rapid-acting and mixed insulin while the patient is on a VRIII.
• It not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hrs prior to surgery. Aim for serum
glucose levels of 6–10mmol/L and check fi nger-prick glucose every 2 hrs. When
ready to eat, give normal dose of rapid acting or mixed insulin with the 1st meal
and stop the VRIII 30–60min later.
• IV fl uid is required while the patient is on a VRIII: see BOX.
• A glucose–potassium–insulin (GKI) infusion can be used as an alternative to a VRIII,
although it is no longer used as standard in the UK.
Tablet-treated diabetes mellitus
• If diabetes is poorly controlled (eg fasting glucose >10mmol/L), treat as for
patients on insulin (see earlier in topic).
• Give usual medications the night before surgery, except long-acting sulfonylureas
(eg glibenclamide) which can cause prolonged hypoglycaemia when fasting and
may need to be substituted 2–3 days pre-operatively. Discuss with the diabetes team.
• If eating and drinking post-operatively: on AM list, omit morning medication and
take any missed drugs with lunch, after surgery. If PM list, take normal medications
with breakfast, omit midday doses, and take any missed drugs with a late lunch.
The dose of these may need reducing, depending on dietary intake.
• If not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hours prior to surgery. Once eating
and drinking, oral hypoglycaemics can be restarted.
• Some patients may need a phase of subcutaneous insulin following major sur-
gery—refer to the diabetes team if serum glucose levels are persistently raised.
• Metformin and iodine IV contrast: Metformin can be continued after IV contrast
in patients with normal serum creatinine and/or eGFR >60mL/min. To minimize the
risk of nephrotoxicity, if serum creatinine is raised or eGFR <60mL/min, stop met-
formin for 48h after contrast and check renal function has returned to baseline
before restarting.
Diet-controlled diabetes There are usually no problems; patients should be treated
as if not diabetic (and do not need to be fi rst on the list). Check capillary blood
glucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases blood glucose levels.
Peri-operative morbidity and mortality Diabetes mellitus is classed as an inter-
mediate risk factor for increased peri-operative cardiovascular risk by the American
Heart Association, so screen for the presence of asymptomatic cardiac and renal
disease (p567) and be aware of possible ‘silent’ myocardial ischaemia. Long-term
post-op survival has been found to be poorer for patients with diabetes; however,
peri-operative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were only increased in the
presence of congestive heart failure and haemodialysis—ie not diabetes alone.

How to write up a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)
Variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) is more accurate a term than the
previously used ‘sliding scale’. Prescribe 50 units of short-acting insulin in 50mL of
0.9% saline to infuse at the rate shown in table 13.7 (according to blood glucose
levels). NB: this is a guide only—infusions may vary between institutions and no one
infusion rate is suitable for all patients.
Table 13.7 Guide to VRIII according to blood glucose levels
Capillary blood glucose (mmol/L) IV soluble insulin (rate of infusion)
<4 . 0 0 . 5 units/h (0 . 0 if long-acting insulin continued)
4 . 1–7 . 0 1 unit/h
7 . 1–9. 0 2 units/h
9 . 1–11 . 0 3 units/h
11 . 1–14 . 0 4 units/h
14 . 1–17 . 0 5 units/h
17 . 1–20 6 units/h
>20 6 units/h; request urgent diabetic review
Fluids should be prescribed to run with the VRIII (through the same cannula via a
non-return valve). Ideally use 0.45% sodium chloride with 5% glucose and either
0.15% potassium chloride (KCl) (=20mmol/L) or 0.3% KCl (=40mmol/L). This pro-
vides a constant supply of substrate, but it is not widely available.
Alternatively, use 10% glucose + KCl. This has a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and
hyponatraemia than 5% glucose. If capillary glucose >15mmol/L when starting
the VRIII use 0.9% saline until <15mmol/L, then use 10% glucose.
Fluid should infuse at 83–125mL/h (ie 1L over 8–12 hours). Omit potassium if there
is renal impairment or hyperkalaemia and slow the rate of infusion in heart failure.

Jaundiced patients undergoing surgery
Avoid operating in patients with obstructive jaundiceΩconsider prior ERCP to relieve.
There is risk of bleeding, peri-operative infection, and renal failure.
Coagulopathy Vitamin K  in obstruction (requires bile in order to be absorbed. If no
history of chronic liver disease, give parenteral vitamin K (consider even if clotting is
normal). FFP may be required in liver disease or active bleeding.
Sepsis Risk due to •bacterial translocation •bacterial colonization of biliary tree
•neutrophil function. If cholangitis present, give antibiotics. Antibiotic prophylaxis
for ERCP not recommended unless biliary decompression fails, or there is a history of
biliary disorders; liver transplantation; presence of a pancreatic pseudocyst; or neu-
tropenia, in which case give oral ciprofl oxacin or IV gentamicin (check local policy).
Renal failure Risk post-op due to intestinal absorption of endotoxin (normally lim-
ited by the detergent eff ect of bile). This causes renal vasoconstriction and acute
tubular necrosis (see p298). The use of lactulose or bile salts pre-op may help. Ensure
adequate IV fl uids pre- and post-operatively to maintain good urine output. Monitor
urine output every 2h. Consider central line, inotropes, and furosemide if output poor
despite adequate hydration. Measure and correct U&E daily.
Surgery in those on anticoagulants
Inform the surgeon and anaesthetist. Risks and benefi ts must be individualized.
Warfarin Minor surgery can be undertaken without stopping (if INR <3.5 it may be
safe to proceed). In major surgery, stop for 3–5d pre-op. Vitamin K ± FFP or Beriplex®
may be needed for emergency reversal of INR. One elective option is conversion to
heparin (stop 6h prior to surgery, and monitor APTT perioperatively). When re-war-
farinizing, give LMWH until INR is therapeutic, as warfarin is initially prothrombotic.
DOACS Decision to stop will be based upon the patient’s risk of having a thromboem-
bolic event and bleeding risk associated with the procedure.4 Where procedure has
no clinically important bleeding risk it can be performed just before the next DOAC
dose/18–24h after last dose and dosing restarted 6h post-op. Low bleeding risk pro-
cedure, omit DOAC 24h pre-op. High bleeding risk procedure,omit DOAC 48h pre-op. If
renal function impaired, may require longer periods of omission pre-op.
Antiplatelets Decision to stop is complex and best discussed with the treating team
(eg cardiologist or neurologist). Premature discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients
with drug-eluting stents can lead to stent thrombosis. The bleeding eff ects of aspirin
are reversed 5d after stopping—check local policy to see if cessation required.
Surgery in those on steroids
Patients on steroids may not be able to mount an appropriate adrenal response to
meet the stress of surgery due to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis. Extra corticosteroid cover may be required, depending on the type of sur-
gery. Consider cover for any patient taking >5mg/d of prednisolone (or equivalent)
for more than 2 weeks or any patient who has had their long-term steroid reduced
in the last 2–4 weeks. There is also potential for HPA suppression in patients taking
long-term, high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids. A guide to supplementation
follows. Patients should take their normal morning steroid dose.
• Minor procedures under local anaesthetic: No supplementation required.
• Moderate procedures: (Eg joint replacement.) Give 50mg hydrocortisone before
induction and 25mg every 8h for 24h. Resume normal dose thereafter.
• Major surgery: Give 100mg hydrocortisone before induction and 50mg every 8h for
24h. After 24h, halve this dose each day until the level of maintenance.
Patients with primary adrenal insuffi ciency will need extra cover—discuss with an
endocrinologist. The major risk with adrenal insuffi ciency is hypotension, so if this is
encountered without an obvious cause, consider a stat dose of hydrocortisone. See
p836 for treatment of Addisonian crisis and BNF section 6.3 for steroid dose equivalents.

Minimally invasive and day case surgery
Laparoscopy was developed within gynaecology and is now in widespread use for
diagnostic purposes and surgical procedures such as appendicectomy, fundoplica-
tion, splenectomy, adrenalectomy, hernia repair, colectomy, prostatectomy, and
nephrectomy. Minimally invasive surgery is also used for thyroidectomy and par-
athyroidectomy.
As a rule of thumb, whatever can be done by laparotomy can also be done with
the laparoscope. This does not mean that it should be done, but if the surgeon is
adequately trained, and the patient feels better sooner, has less post-operative pain,
can return to work earlier, and has fewer complications, then there are obvious
advantages. Pre-procedure counselling should always discuss the complications of
laparoscopic surgery (eg accidental damage to other intra-abdominal organs) as
well as the risk of conversion to an open procedure.
Challenges of minimal access surgery The 2-dimensional visual representation
and diff erent surgical approach alters the normal appearance of familiar anatomy.
Palpation is impossible and it may be harder to locate lesions prior to resection. As
a result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be
learned and taught.
Day-case surgery Advances in surgical techniques as well as perioperative care
mean better results for the patient (shorter waiting lists, fewer infections, fewer
days off work, and patient satisfaction). Many operations can now be performed as
day cases. Theoretically any procedure is suitable, provided the time under general
anaesthetic does not exceed ~1h. The use of regional anaesthesia helps to avoid the
SE of nausea and disorientation that may accompany a general anaesthetic, thus
facilitating discharge.
Bear in mind that the following groups of patients may not be suitable for day-case
surgery: •Severe dementia. •Severe learning diffi culties. •Living alone (and no helpers).
•Children if supervision diffi cult—changes in expectation, delays, and pain relief can
be problematic. •BMI >32 (p244). •ASA category ≥ III (p567) thus potentially unstable
comorbidities—discuss with the anaesthetist. •Infection at the site of the operation.
Exposing patients to our learning curves? The jury is still out…
All surgeons get better over time (for a while), as they perform new techniques
with increasing ease and confi dence. When Wertheim did his fi rst hysterectomies,
his fi rst dozen patients died—but then one survived. He assumed it was a good
operation, and pressed ahead. He was a brave man, and thousands of women owe
their lives to him. But had he tried to do this today, he would have been stopped.
The UK’s General Medical Council (GMC) and other august bodies tell us that we
must protect the public by reporting doctors whose patients have low survival
rates. The reason for this is partly ethical, and partly to preserve self-regulation.
We have the toughest codes of practice and disciplinary procedures of any group
of workers. It is assumed that doctors are loyal to each other out of self-interest,
and that this loyalty is bad. This has never been tested formally, and is not evi-
dence-based. We can imagine two clinical worlds: one of constant ‘reportings’ and
recriminatory audits, and another of trust and team-work. Both are imperfect,
but we should not assume that the fi rst world would be better for our patients.
When patients are sick with fear, they do not, perhaps, want to know every-
thing. We may tell to protect ourselves. We may not tell to protect ourselves.
Perhaps what we should do is, in our hearts, appeal to those 12 dead women-of-
Wertheim—a jury as infallible as sacrifi cial—and try to hear their reply. And to
those who complain that in doing so we are playing God, it is possible to reply with
some humility that, whatever it is, it does not seem like play.
‘It is amazing what little harm doctors do when one considers all the opportuni-
ties they have.’ M. Twain.

Lumps
Examine the regional lymph nodes as well as the lump. If the lump is a node, examine
its area of drainage. Always examine the circulation and nerve supply distal to any lump.
History How long has it been there? Does it hurt? Any other symptoms, eg itch? Any
other lumps? Is it getting bigger? Ever been abroad? Otherwise well?
Physical exam Remember the 6 S’s: site, size, shape, smoothness (consistency), sur-
face (contour/edge/colour), and surroundings. Other questions: Does it transilluminate
(see next paragraph)? Is it fi xed/tethered to skin or underlying structures (see BOX)?
Is it fl uctuant/compressible? Temperature? Tender? Pulsatile (US duplex may help)?
Transilluminable lumps After eliminating as much external light as possible, place
a bright, thin ‘pen’ torch on the lump, from behind (or at least to the side), so the
light is shining through the lump towards your eye. If the lump glows red it is said to
transilluminate—a fl uid-fi lled lump such as a hydrocele is a good example.
Lipomas These benign fatty lumps, occurring wherever fat can expand (ie not scalp
or palms), have smooth, imprecise margins, a hint of fl uctuance, and are not fi xed
to skin or deeper structures. Symptoms are only caused via pressure. Malignant
change very rare (suspect if rapid growth/hardening/vascularization). Multiple scat-
tered lipomas, which may be painful,occur in Dercum’s disease,typically in post-
menopausal women.
Sebaceous cysts Refer to either epidermal (fi g 13.11) or pilar cysts (they are not of
sebaceous origin and contain keratin, not sebum). They appear as fi rm, round, mobile
subcutaneous nodules of varying size. Look for the characteristic central punctum.
Infection is quite common, and foul pus exits through the punctum. They are com-
mon on the scalp, face, neck, and trunk. Treatment: Excision of cyst and contents.
Lymph nodes Causes of enlargement: Infection: Glandular fever; brucellosis; TB;
HIV; toxoplasmosis; actinomycosis; syphilis. Infi ltration: Malignancy (carcinoma,
lymphoma); sarcoidosis.
Cutaneous abscesses Staphylococci are the most common organisms. Haemolytic
streptococci only common in hand infections. Proteus is a common cause of non-
staphylococcal axillary abscesses. Below the waist, faecal organisms are common
(aerobes and anaerobes). Treatment: Incise and drain. Boils (furuncles) are ab-
scesses involving a hair follicle and associated glands. A carbuncle is an area of
subcutaneous necrosis which discharges itself on to the surface through multiple si-
nuses. Think of hidradenitis suppurativa if recurrent inguinal or axillary abscesses.
Rheumatoid nodules (fi g 13.12) Collagenous granulomas which appear in established
rheumatoid arthritis on the extensor aspects of joints—especially the elbows (fi g 13.12).
Ganglia Degenerative cysts from an adjacent joint or synovial sheath commonly
seen on the dorsum of the wrist or hand and dorsum of the foot. May transilluminate.
50% disappear spontaneously. Aspiration may be eff ective, especially when com-
bined with instillation of steroid and hyaluronidase. For the rest, treatment of choice
is excision rather than the traditional blow from your bible (the Oxford Textbook of
Surgery)! See fi g 13.13.
Fibromas These may occur anywhere in the body, but most commonly under the
skin. These whitish, benign tumours contain collagen, fi broblasts, and fi brocytes.
Dermoid cysts Contain dermal structures and are found at the junction of embry-
onic cutaneous boundaries, eg in the midline or lateral to the eye. See fi g 13.14.
Malignant tumours of connective tissue Fibrosarcomas, lipos arcomas, leiomyo-
sarcomas (smooth muscle), and rhabdomyosarcomas (striated muscle). These are
staged using modifi ed TNM system including tumour grade. Needle-core (Trucut®)
biopsies of large tumours precede excision. Any lesion suspected of being a sarcoma
should not be simply enucleated. Refer to a specialist.
Neurofi bromas See p514.
Keloids Caused by irregular hypertrophy of vascularized collagen forming raised
edges at sites of previous scars that extend outside the scar (fi g 13.15). Common in
dark skin. Treatment can be diffi cult. Intralesional steroid injections are a mainstay.

Short periods of intense UV exposure is a major cause, particularly in the early years.
May occur in pre-existing moles. If smooth, well-demarcated, and regular, it is un-

Superfi cial spreading melanomas (70%) grow slowly, metastasize later, and have
better prognosis than nodular melanomas (10–15%) which invade deeply and me-
tastasize early. Nodular lesions may be amelanotic in ~5%. Others: acral melanomas
occur on palms, soles, and subungual areas; lentigo maligna melanoma evolves from
pre-exisiting lentigo maligna. Breslow thickness (depth in mm), tumour stage, and
presence of ulceration are important prognostic factors. : urgent excision can be cu-
rative. Chemotherapy gives a response in 10–30% with metastatic disease (OHCS p592).
Ipilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an inhibitory T-cell re-
ceptor, has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.5,6
2 Squamous cell cancer: Usually presents as an ulcerated lesion, with hard, raised
edges, in sun-exposed sites. May begin in solar keratoses (see later in topic), or be
found on the lips of smokers or in long-standing ulcers (=Marjolin’s ulcer). Metastasis
to lymph nodes is rare, local destruction may be extensive. : excision + radiotherapy to
treat recurrence/aff ected nodes. See fi g 13.17. NB: the condition may be confused with
a keratoacanthoma—a fast-growing, benign, self-limiting papule plugged with keratin.
3 Basal cell carcinoma: (AKA rodent ulcer) Nodular: typically a pearly nodule with rolled
telangiectatic edge, on the face or a sun-exposed site. May have a central ulcer. See
fi g 13.18. Metastases are very rare. It slowly causes local destruction if left untreated.
Superfi cial: lesions appear as red scaly plaques with a raised smooth edge, often on the
trunk or shoulders. Cause: (most frequently) UV exposure. : excision; cryotherapy; for
superfi cial BCCS topical fl urouracil or imiquimod (see as for ‘Solar keratoses’).
Pre-malignant tumours
1 Solar (actinic) keratoses appear on sun-exposed skin as crumbly, yellow-white
crusts. Malignant change to squamous cell carcinoma may occur after several years.
Treatment: cryotherapy; 5% fl uorouracil cream or 5% imiquimod—work by causing:
erythema  vesiculation  erosion  ulceration  necrosis  healing epithelialization,
leaving healthy skin unharmed. Warn patients of expected infl ammatory reaction. See
BNF for dosing. Alternatively: diclofenac gel (3%, use thinly twice-daily for ≤90d).
2 Bowen’s disease: Slow-growing red/brown scaly plaque, eg on lower legs. Histology:
full-thickness dysplasia (carcinoma in situ). It infrequently progresses to squamous
cell cancer. Penile Bowen’s disease is called Queyrat’s erythroplasia. Treatment: cryo-
therapy, topical fl uorouracil (see as for ‘Solar keratoses’) or photodynamic therapy.
3 See also Kaposi’s sarcoma (p702); Paget’s disease of the breast (p708).
Others •Secondary carcinoma: Most common metastases to skin are from breast,
kidney, or lung. Usually a fi rm nodule, most often on the scalp. See also acanthosis
nigricans (p562). •Mycosis fungoides: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually confi ned
to skin. Causes itchy, red plaques (Sézary syndrome-variant also associated with
erythroderma). •Leucoplakia: This appears as white patches (which may fi ssure) on
oral or genital mucosa (where it may itch). Frank carcinomatous change may occur.
•Leprosy: Suspect in any anaesthetic hypopigmented lesion (p441). •Syphilis: Any
genital ulcer is syphilis until proved otherwise. Secondary syphilis: papular rash—in-
cluding, unusually, on the palms (p412).

Lumps in the neck
Don’t biopsy lumps until tumours within the head and neck have been excluded by
an ENT surgeon. Culture all biopsied lymph nodes for TB.
Diagnosis (See fi g 13.19.) First, ask how long the lump has been present. If <3wks,
self-limiting infection is the likely cause and extensive investigation is unwise. Next ask
yourself where the lump is. Is it intradermal—eg sebaceous cyst with a central punc-
tum (p594)? Is it a lipoma (p594)? If the lump is not intradermal, and is not of recent
onset, you are about to start a diagnostic hunt over complicated terrain. 85% of neck
swellings are lymph nodes (examine areas which they serve). Consider TB, viruses such
as HIV or EBV (infectious mononucleosis), any chronic infection, or, if >20yrs, consider
lymphoma (hepatosplenomegaly?) or metastases (eg from GI or bronchial or head and
neck neoplasia), 8% are goitres (p600), and other diagnoses account for 7%.
Tests Do virology and TB tests (p394). US shows lump consistency: cystic, solid, com-
plex, vascular. CT defi nes masses in relation to their anatomical neighbours. CXR may
show malignancy or, in sarcoid, reveal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Consider
fi ne-needle aspiration (FNA).
Midline lumps •If patient is <20yrs old, likely diagnosis is dermoid cyst (p594). •If it
moves up on tongue protrusion and is below the hyoid, likely to be a thyroglossal cyst,
a fl uid-fi lled sac resulting from incomplete closure of the thyroid’s migration path. :
Surgery; they are the commonest congenital cervical cystic lump. •If >20yrs old, it is
probably a thyroid isthmus mass. •If it is bony hard, the diagnosis may be a chon-
droma (benign cartilaginous tumour).
Submandibular triangle (Bordered by the mental process, mandible, and the line
between the two angles of the mandible.) •If <20yrs, self-limiting lymphadenopathy
is likely. If >20yrs, exclude malignant lymphadenopathy (eg fi rm and non-tender).
Is TB likely? •If it is not a node, think of submandibular salivary stone, sialadenitis,
or tumour (see BOX for Salivary gland pathology).
Anterior triangle (Between midline, anterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and
the line between the two angles of the mandible.) •Branchial cysts emerge under
the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid where the upper third meets the mid-
dle third (age <20yrs). Due to non-disappearance of the cervical sinus (where 2nd
branchial arch grows down over 3rd and 4th). Lined by squamous epithelium, their
fl uid contains cholesterol crystals. Treat by excision. There may be communication
with the pharynx in the form of a fi stula. •If lump in the supero-posterior area of the
anterior triangle, is it a parotid tumour (more likely if >40yrs)? •Laryngoceles are
an uncommon cause of anterior triangle lumps. They are painless and may be made
worse by blowing. These cysts are classifi ed as external, internal, or mixed, and may
be associated with laryngeal cancer. If pulsatile may be: •Carotid artery aneurysm,
•Tortuous carotid artery, or •Carotid body tumours (chemodectoma). These are
very rare, move from side to side but not up and down, and splay out the carotid
bifurcation. They are usually fi rm and occasionally soft and pulsatile. They do not
usually cause bruits. They may be bilateral, familial, and malignant (5%). Suspect in
any mass just anterior to the upper third of sternomastoid. Diagnose by duplex USS
(splaying at the carotid bifurcation) or digital computer angiography. : Extirpation
by vascular surgeon.
Posterior triangle (Behind sternocleidomastoid, in front of trapezius, above clavi-
cle.) •Cervical ribs may intrude into this area. These are enlarged costal elements
from C7 vertebra. The majority are asymptomatic but can cause Raynaud’s syndrome
by compressing subclavian artery and neurological symptoms (eg wasting of 1st dor-
sal interosseous) from pressure on lower trunk of the brachial plexus. •Pharyngeal
pouches can protrude into the posterior triangle on swallowing (usually left-sided).
•Cystic hygromas (usually infants) arise from jugular lymph sac. These macrocystic
lymphatic malformations transilluminate brightly. Treat by surgery or hypertonic sa-
line sclerosant injection. Recurrence can be troublesome. •Pancoast’s tumour (see
p708). •Subclavian artery aneurysm will be pulsatile.

Salivary gland pathology
There are three pairs of major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublin-
gual (there are many minor glands). History: Lumps; swelling related to food; pain.
Examination: Note external swelling; look for secretions; bimanual palpation for
stones. Examine VIIth nerve and regional lymph nodes. Cytology: Do FNA.
Acute swelling Think of mumps and HIV. Recurrent unilateral pain and swelling
is likely to be from a stone. 80% are sub-
mandibular. The classical story is of pain
and swelling on eating—with a red, tender,
swollen, but uninfected gland. The stone
may be seen on plain X-ray or by sialography
(fi g 13.20). Distal stones are removed via the
mouth but deeper stones may require exci-
sion of the gland. Chronic bilateral symp-
toms may coexist with dry eyes and mouth
and autoimmune disease, eg hypothyroidism,
Mikulicz’s or Sjögren’s syndrome (p706 &
p710)—also bulimia or alcohol excess. Fixed
swelling may be from a tumour/ALL (fi g 8.49, Fig 13.20 Normal sialogram of the sub-
p355), sarc oid, amyloid, granulomatosis with mandibular gland. Wharton’s (subman-
polyangiitis , or be idiopathic. dibular) duct opens into the mouth near

swelling for assessment if present for >1 month. VIIth nerve palsy means malignancy.

Pleomorphic adenoma Acinic cell Adenoid cystic ca
Pleomorphic adenomas often present in middle age and grow slowly. Remove
by superfi cial parotidectomy. Adenolymphomas (Warthin’s tumour): usually older
men; soft; treat by enucleation. Carcinomas: rapid growth; hard fi xed mass; pain;
facial palsy. Treatment: surgery + radiotherapy.

Lumps in the thyroid
If the thyroid (fi g 13.21) is enlarged (=goitre), ask yourself: 1 Is the thyroid diff usely en-
larged or nodular? 2 Is the patient euthyroid, thyrotoxic (p218), or hypothyroid (p220)?
Diff use goitre: Causes: Endemic (iodine defi ciency); congenital; secondary to goi-
trogens (substances that  iodine uptake); acute thyroiditis (de Quervain’s); physi-
ological (pregnancy/puberty); autoimmune (Graves’ disease; Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).
Nodular goitre: •Multinodular goitre (MNG): The most common goitre in the UK.
50% who present with a single nodule actually have MNG. Patients are usually eu-
thyroid, but may become hyperthyroid (‘toxic’). MNG may be retro- or substernal.
Hypothyroidism and malignancy within MNG are rare. Plummer’s disease is hyper-
thyroidism with a single toxic nodule (uncommon). •Fibrotic goitre: Eg Reidel’s thy-
roiditis. •Solitary thyroid nodule: typically cyst, adenoma, discrete nodule in MNG
or malignant (~10%).
Investigations Check TSH and USS (solid, cystic, complex or part of a group of
lumps). If abnormal consider: •T4, autoantibodies (p216, eg if Hashimoto’s /Graves’,
suspected). •CXR with thoracic inlet view (tracheal goitres and metastases?). •Ra-
dionuclide scans (fi g 13.22) may show malignant lesions as hypofunctioning or ‘cold’,
whereas a hyperfuncti oning ‘hot’ lesion suggests adenoma. •FNA (fi ne-needle aspira-
tion) and cytologyΩwill characterize lesion. A FNA fi nding of a follicular neoplasm
can be challenging (15–30% malignant)Ωdiscuss with cytopathologist and perform
molecular diagnostics where available; if any doubt, refer for surgery.
What should you do if high-resolution ultrasound shows impalpable nodules?
Such thyroid nodules can usually be observed provided they are:
• <1cm across (which accounts for most; ultrasound can detect lumps <2mm; such
‘incidentalomas’ occur in 46% of routine autopsies) and are asymptomatic.
• There is no past history of thyroid cancer or neck irradiation.
• No family history of medullary cancer (if present, do USS-guided FNA).
Thyroid cancer
1 Papillary: (60%.) Often in younger patients. Spread: lymph nodes and lung (jugulo-
digastric node metastasis is the so-called lateral aberrant thyroid). : total thyroid-
ectomy to remove non-obvious tumour ± node excision ± radioiodine (131I) to ablate
residual cells. Give levothyroxine to suppress TSH. Prognosis: better if young and .
2 Follicular: (≤25%.) Occurs in middle-age and spreads early via blood (bone, lungs).
Well-diff erentiated. : total thyroidectomy + T4 suppression + radioiodine ablation.
3 Medullary: (5%.) Sporadic (80%) or part of MEN syndrome (p223). May produce
calcitonin which can be used as a tumour marker. They do not concentrate iodine.
Perform a phaeochromocytoma screen pre-op. : thyroidectomy + node clear-
ance. External beam radiot herapy may prevent regional recurrence.
4 Lymphoma: (5%.) :≈3:1. May present with stridor or dysphagia. Do full stag-
ing pre-treatment (chemoradiotherapy). Assess histology for mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) origin (associated with a good prognosis).
5 Anaplastic: Rare. :≈3:1. Elderly, poor response to any treatment. In the absence
of unresectable disease, excision + radiotherapy may be tried.
Thyroid surgery Plays a signifi cant role in the management of thyroid disease.
Operations include partial lobectomy or lobectomy (for isolated nodules); and thy-
roidectomy (for cancers, MNG, or Graves’). Indications: Pressure symptoms, relapse
hyperthyroidism after >1 failed course of drug treatment, carcinoma, cosmetic
reasons, symptomatic patients planning pregnancy. Pre-operative management:
Render euthyroid pre-op with antithyroid drugs (eg carbimazole up to 20mg/12h PO
or p ropylthiouracil 200mg/12h PO but stop 10d prior to surgery as these increase vas-
cularity). Propranolol up to 80mg/8h PO can be used to control tachycardia or tremor
associated with hyperthyroidism (continue for 5d post-op). Check vocal cords by in-
direct laryngoscopy pre- and post-op (risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury). Check
serum Ca2+ (and PTH if abnormal). Complications: see p580.

Breast carcinoma
Epidemiology Aff ects 1 in 8 ; nearly 60 000 new cases per year in UK (incidence
increasing). Rare in men (~1% of all breast cancers).
Risk factors Risk is related to family history, age, and uninterr upted oestrogen ex-
posure, hence: nulliparity; 1st pregnancy >30yrs old, early menarche; late menopause;
HRT; obesity; BRCA genes (p521); not breastfeeding; past breast cancer (metachronous
rate ≈2%, synchronous rate ≈1%).
Pathology Non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is premalignant and seen as
microcalcifi cation on mammography (unifocal or widespread). Non-invasive lobular
CIS is rarer and tends to be multifocal. Invasive ductal carcinoma is most common
(~70%) whereas invasive lobular carcinoma accounts for 10–15% of breast cancers.
Medullary cancers (~5%) tend to aff ect younger patients while colloid/mucoid
(~2%) tend to aff ect the elderly. Others: papillary, tubular, adenoid-cystic and Pa-
get’s (p708). 60–70% of breast cancers are oestrogen receptor +ve, conveying better
prognosis. ~30% over-express HER2 (growth factor receptor gene) associated with
aggressive disease and poorer prognosis.
Investigations (See p82 for history and examination.) All lumps should undergo
‘triple’ assessment: Clinical examination + histology/cytology + mammography/ul-
trasound; see fi g 13.24.
Staging: Stage 1: Confi ned to breast, mobile. Stage 2: Growth confi ned to breast,
mobile, lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla. Stage 3: Tumour fi xed to muscle (but not
chest wall), ipsilateral lymph nodes matted and may be fi xed, skin involvement larger
than tumour. Stage 4: Complete fi xation of tumour to chest wall, distant metasta-
ses. Also TNM staging: (p523) T1<2cm, T2, 2–5cm, T3 >5cm, T4, fi xity to chest wall or
peau d’orange; N1, mobile ipsilateral nodes; N2, fi xed nodes; M1, distant metastases.
Treating local disease (Stage 1–2.)7 •Surgery: Removal of tumour by wide local
excision (WLE) or mastectomy ± breast reconstruction + axillary node sampling/
surgical clearance or sentinel node biopsy (BOX ‘Sentinel node biopsy’). •Radio-
therapy: Recommended for all patients with invasive cancer after WLE. Risk of
recurrence decreases from 30% to <10% at 10yrs and increases overall survival.
Axillary radiotherapy used if lymph node +ve on sampling and surgical clearance
not performed (risk of lymphoedema and brachial plexopathy). SE: pneumonitis,
pericarditis, and rib fractures. •Chemotherapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves
survival and reduces recurrence in most groups of women (consider in all except
excellent prognosis patients), eg epirubicin + ‘CMF’ (cyclophosphamide + methotrex-
ate + 5-FU). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown no diff erence in survival but may
facilitate breast-conserving surgery. •Endocrine agents: Aim to  oestr ogen activity
and are used in oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) +ve disease.
The ER blocker tamoxifen is widely used, eg 20mg/d PO for 5yrs post-op (may rarely
cause uterine cancer so warn to report vaginal bleeding). Aromatase inhibitors (eg
anastrozole) targeting peripheral oestrogen synthesis are also used (may be better
tolerated). They are only used if post-menopausal. If pre-menopausal and an ER+ve
tumour, ovarian ablation (via surgery or radiotherapy) or GnRH anal ogues (eg gos-
erelin)  recurrence and  survival. • Support: Breastcare nurses •Reconstruction
options: Eg tissue expanders/implants/nipple tattoos, latissimus dorsi fl ap, TRAM
(transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) fl ap.
Treating distant disease (Stage 3–4.)8 Long-term survival is possible and median
survival is >2yrs. Staging investigations should include CXR, bone scan, liver USS, CT/
MRI or PET-CT (p739), + LFTS and Ca2+. Radiotherapy (p526) to painful bony lesions (bis-
phosphonates, p677, may  pain and fracture risk). Tamoxifen is often used in ER+ve;
if relapse after initial success, consider chemotherapy. Trastuzumab should be given
for HER2 +ve tumours, in combination with chemotherapy. CNS surgery for solitary (or
easily accessible) metastases may be possible; if not—radiotherapy. Get specialist help
for arm lymphoedema (try decongestive methods fi rst).
Preventing deaths •Promote awareness. •Screening: 2-view mammography every
3yrs for women aged 47–73 in UK has  breast cancer deaths by 30% in women >50yrs.

* US is more accurate at detecting invasive breast cancer, though mammography remains most accurate at
detecting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). MRI is used in the assessment of multif ocal/bilateral disease and
patients with cosmetic implants who are identifi ed as high risk.
Sentinel node biopsy
Decreases needless axillary clearances in lymph node Ωve patients.
• Patent blue dye and/or radiocolloid injected into periareolar area or tumour.
• A gamma probe/visual inspection is used to identify the sentinel node.
• The sentinel node is biopsied and sent for histology ± immunohisto chemistry;
further clearance only if sentinel node +ve.
Sentinel node identifi ed in 90%. False Ωve rates <5% for experienced surgeons.
Prognostic factors in breast cancer
Tumour size, grade, lymph node status, ER/PR status, presence of vascular invasion
all help assess prognosis. Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) is widely used to
predict survival and risk of relapse, and to help select appropriate adjuvant sys-
temic therapy. NPI = 0.2 ≈ tumour size (cm) + histological grade + nodal status6
If treated with surgery alone, 10yr survival rates are: NPI <2.4: 95%; NPI 2.4–3.4:
85%; NPI 3.4–4.4: 70%; NPI 4.4–5.4: 50%; NPI >5.4: 20%.
Benign breast disease
Fibroadenoma: Usually presents <30yrs but can occur up to menopause. Benign
overgrowth of collagenous mesenchyme of one breast lobule. Firm, smooth, mobile
lump, the ‘breast mouse’. Painless. May be multiple. ⅓ regress, ⅓ stay the same, ⅓
get bigger. : observation and reassurance, but if in doubt refer for USS (usually
conclusive) ± FNA. Surgical excision if large.
Breast cysts: Common >35yrs, esp. perimenopausal. Benign, fl uid-fi lled rounded
lump. Not fi xed to surrounding tissue. Occasionally painful. : diagnosis confi rmed
on aspiration (perform only if trained).
Infective mastitis/breast abscesses: Infection of mammary duct often associat-
ed with lactation (usually Staph. aureus). Abscess presents as painful, hot swelling
of breast segment. : antibiotics. Open incision or percutaneous drainage if abscess.
Duct ectasia: Typically around menopause. Ducts become blocked and secre-
tions stagnate. Present with nipple discharge (green/brown/bloody) ± nipple re-
traction ± lump. Refer for confi rmation of diagnosis. Usually no  needed. Advise
to stop smoking.
Fat necrosis: Fibrosis and calcifi cation after injury to breast tissue. Scarring re-
sults in a fi rm lump. Refer for triple assessment. No  once diagnosis confi rmed.
6 Nodal status is scored 1–3: 1 = node –ve; 2 = 1–3 nodes +ve; 3 = >3 nodes +ve for breast cancer. Histological

Abdominal masses
As with any mass (see p594), determine size, site, shape, and surface. Find out if it is
pulsatile and if it is mobile. Examine supraclavicular and inguinal nodes. Is the lump
ballotable (like bobbing an apple up and down in water)?

Abdominal distension Flatus, fat, fl uid, faeces, or fetus (p57)? Fluid may be outside
the gut (ascites) or sequestered in bowel (obstruction; ileus). To demonstrate ascites
elicit signs of a fl uid thrill and/or shifting dullness (p61).
Causes of ascites Ascites with portal hypertension
• Malignancy • CCF; pericarditis • Cirrhosis • Portal nodes
• Infections—esp. TB • Pancreatitis • Budd–Chiari syndrome (p696)
• Albumin (eg nephrosis) • Myxoedema. • IVC or portal vein thrombosis.
Tests: Aspirate ascitic fl uid (p764) for cytology, culture and albumin;7 US.
Left upper quadrant mass Is it spleen, stomach, kidney, colon, pancreas, or a rare
cause (eg neurofi broma)? Pancreatic cysts may be true (congenital; cystadenomas;
retention cysts of chronic pancreatitis; cystic fi brosis) or pseudocysts (fl uid in lesser

Pelvic masses Fibroids, fetus, bladder, ovarian cysts or malignancies. Is it truly pel-
vic?—Yes, if by palpation you cannot get ‘below it’.
Investigating lumps Check FBC (with fi lm); CRP; U&E; LFT; Ca2+; tumour markers only as
appropriate. Imaging by CT or US (transvaginal approach may be useful); MRI also has
a role, eg in assessment of liver masses (p286). Others: TB tests (p394). Biopsy to give

The fi rst successful laparotomy...
In 1809, an American surgeon by the name of Ephraim McDowell performed an
astonishing operation: the fi rst successful elective laparotomy for an abdominal
tumour. It was an ovariotomy for an ovarian mass in a 44-year-old who, prior
to physical examination by McDowell, was believed to be gravid. Not only was
this feat performed in the age before anaesthesia and antisepsis, but it was also
performed on a table in the front room of McDowell’s Kentucky home, at that
time on the frontier of the West in the United States. His account of the opera-
tion makes fascinating reading. While the strength of his diagnostic convictions
combined with his speed and skill at operating is to be admired (the operation
took 25 minutes), there is an even more laudable part played in this story. The
patient, Mrs Jane Todd-Crawford, was fully willing to be involved with what can
only be described as experimental surgery in the face of uncertainty. She defi ed
pain simply by reciting psalms and hymns, and was back at home within 4 weeks
with no complications, ultimately living another 33 years. We would be well served
in remembering the exceptional commitment of Mrs Todd-Crawford. In the rush
and hurry of our daily tasks perhaps it is all to easy to forget that the undertak-
ing of surgery today may be no less fear-provoking for patients than it was 200
years ago.

The acute abdomen
Someone who becomes acutely ill and in whom symptoms and signs are chiefl y
related to the abdomen has an acute abdomen. Prompt laparotomy is sometimes
essential: repeated examination is the key to making the decision.
Clinical syndromes that usually require laparotomy
1 Rupture of an organ (Spleen, aorta, ectopic pregnancy.) Shock is a leading sign—
see table 13.10 for assessment of blood loss. Abdominal swelling may be seen. Any
history of trauma: blunt trauma  spleen; penetrating trauma  liver? Delayed
rupture of the spleen may occur weeks after trauma. Peritonism may be mild.
2 Peritonitis (Perforation of peptic ulcer/duodenal ulcer, diverticulum, appendix,
bowel, or gallbladder.) Signs: prostration, shock, lying still, +ve cough test (p62),
tenderness (± rebound/percussion pain, p62), board-like abdominal rigidity, guard-
ing, and no bowel sounds. Erect CXR may show gas under the diaphragm (fi g 13.26).
NB: acute pancreatitis (p636) causes these signs, but does not require a laparotomy
so don’t be caught out and always check serum amylase.
Syndromes that may not require a laparotomy
Local peritonitis:Eg diverticulitis,cholecystitis,salpingitis,and appendicitis(the lat-
ter will need surgery). If abscess formation is suspected (swelling, swinging fever,
and WCC) do US or CT. Drainage can be percutaneous (US or CT-guided), or by lapa-
rotomy. Peritoneal infl ammation can cause localized ileus with a ‘sentinel loop’ of
intraluminal gas visible on plain AXR (p729).
Colic is a regularly waxing and waning pain, caused by muscular spasm in a hollow
viscus, eg gut, ureter, salpinx, uterus, bile duct, or gallbladder (in the latter, pain is
often dull and constant). Colic, unlike peritonitis, causes restlessness and the patient
may well be pacing around when you go to review!
Obstruction of the bowel See p610.
Tests U&E; FBC; amylase; LFT; CRP; lactate (is there mesenteric ischaemia?); urinalysis.
Urine and serum hCG is vital to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Erect CXR (fi g 13.26),
AXR may show Rigler’s sign (p728). Laparoscopy may avert open surgery. CT can be
helpful provided it is readily available and causes no delay (pp732–3); US may identify
perforati on or free fl uid (appropriate performer training is important).
Pre-op Don’t rush to theatre. Anaesthesia compounds shock, so resuscitate prop-
erly fi rst (p790) unless blood being lost faster than can be replaced, eg ruptured
ectopic pregnancy, (OHCS p262), aneurysm leak (p654), trauma.
Plan Bed rest, keep NBM; assess volume status (BOX) and treat shock (p790); cross-
match/group and save; analgesia (p574); arrange imaging; consider need for IVI,
blood cultures, and antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV); ECG.
The medical acute abdomen Irritable bowel syndrome (p266) is the chief cause, so
always ask about episodes of pain associated with loose stools, relieved by defeca-
tion, bloating, and urgency (but not blood—this may be UC). Other causes:
Myocardial infarction Pneumonia (p166) Sickle-cell crisis (p341)
Gastroenteritis or UTI Thyroid storm (p834) Phaeochromocytoma (p837)
Diabetes mellitus/DKA (p206) Zoster (p404) Malaria (p416)
Bornholm disease Tuberculosis (p393) Typhoid fever (p415)
Pneumococcal peritonitis Porphyria (p692) Cholera (p430)
Henoch–Schönlein (p702) Narcotic addiction Yersinia enterocolitica (p431)
Tabes dorsalis (p412) PAN (p556) Lead colic
Hidden diagnoses Mesenteric ischaemia (p620), acute pancreatitis (p636), and
leaking AAA (p654) are the Unterseeboote of the acute abdomen—unsuspected,
undetectable unless carefully looked for, and underestimatedly deadly. They may
have non-specifi c symptoms and signs that are surprisingly mild, so always think
of them when assessing the acute abdomen and hopefully you will ‘spot’ them!
Finally: always exclude pregnancy (± ectopic?) in females.

Assessing hypovolaemia from blood loss
Treat suspected shock rather than wait for BP to fall. The most likely cause of
shock in a surgical patient is hypovolaemia. Check urine output, GCS, and capillary refi ll
(CR) as measures of renal, brain, and skin perfusion.
When there is any blood loss, assess the status of the following:

Acute appendicitis
Incidence Most common surgical emergency (lifetime incidence = 6%). Can occur
at any age, though highest incidence is between 10–20yrs.8 It is rare before age 2
because the appendix is cone shaped with a larger lumen.
Pathogenesis Gut organisms invade the appendix wall after lumen obstruction by
lymphoid hyperplasia, faecolith, or fi larial worms. This leads to oedema, ischaemic
necrosis, and perforation.
Presentation Classically periumbilical pain that moves to the RIF. Associated signs
may include tachycardia, fever, peritonism with guarding and rebound or percussion
tenderness in RIF. Pain on right during PR examination suggests an infl ammed, low-
lying pelvic appendix. Anorexia is an important feature; vomiting is rarely promi-
nent—pain normally precedes vomiting in the surgical abdomen. Constipation is
usual, though diarrhoea may occur. Additional signs: Rovsing’s sign (pain > in RIF
than LIF when the LIF is pressed). Psoas sign (pain on extending hip if retrocaecal
appendix). Cope sign (pain on fl exion and internal rotation of right hip if appendix in
close relation to obturator internus).
Investigations Blood tests may reveal neutrophil leucocytosis and elevated CRP. US
may help, but the appendix is not always visualized. CT has high diagnostic accuracy
and is useful if diagnosis is unclear: it reduces Ωve appendicectomy rate.
Variations in the clinical picture
• Infl ammation in a retrocecal/retroperitoneal appendix (2.5%) may cause fl ank or
RUQ pain; its only sign may be tenderness on the right on PR.
• The child with vague abdominal pain who will not eat their favourite food.
• The shocked, confused octogenarian who is not in pain.
• Appendicitis occurs in ~1/1000 pregnancies. Mortality is higher, especially from
20wks’ gestation. Perforation is more common, and increases fetal mortality. Pain is
often less well localized (may be RUQ) and signs of peritonism less obvious.
Hints
• If a child is anxious, use their hand to press their tummy.
• Check for recent viral illnesses and lymphadenopathy—mesenteric adenitis?
• Don’t start palpating in the RIF (makes it diffi cult to elicit pain elsewhere).
• Expect diagnosis to be wrong half the time. If diagnosis is uncertain, re-examine
often. A normal appendix is removed in up to 20% of patients.
Treatment Prompt appendicectomy (fi g 13.27). Antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobac-
tam 4.5g/8h, 1 to 3 doses IV starting 1h pre-op, reduces wound infections. Give a long-
er course if perforated. Laparoscopy: Has dia gnostic and therapeutic advantages
(if surgeon experienced), especially in women and the obese. It is not recommended
in cases of suspected gangrenous perf or ation as the rate of abscess formation may
be higher.
Complications
• Perforation is commoner if a faecolith is present and in young children,as the
diagnosis is more often delayed.
• Appendix mass may result when an infl amed appendix becomes covered with omen-
tum. US/CT may help with diagnosis. Some advocate early surgery. Alternatively,
initial conservative management—NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some
perform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (lapa-
rotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th decade.
• Appendix abscess May result if an appendix mass fails to resolve but enlarges
and the patient gets more unwell. Treatment usually involves drainage (surgical or
percutaneous under US/CT-guidance). Antibiotics alone may bring resolution.
8 There is a second peak between 60–70yrs; older adults may present later with atypical symptoms.

Explaining the patterns of abdominal pain
Internal organs and the visceral peritoneum have no somatic innervation, so the
brain attributes the visceral (splanchnic) signals to a physical location whose der-
matome corresponds to the same entry level in the spinal cord. Importantly, there
is no laterality to the visceral unmyelinated C-fi bre pain signals, which enter the
cord bilaterally and at multiple levels. Division of the gut according to embryologi-
cal origin is the important determinant here: see table 13.11.
Table 13.11 Somatic referral of abdominal pain
Gut Division points Somatic referral Arterial supply
Fore Proximal to 2nd part of duodenum Epigastrium Coeliac axis
Mid Above to ⅔ along transverse colon Periumbilical Superior mesenteric
Hind Distal to above Suprapubic Inferior mesenteric
Early infl ammation irritates the structure and walls of the appendix, so a colicky
pain is referred to the mid-abdomen—classically periumbilical. As the infl ammation
progresses and irritates the parietal peritoneum (especially on examination), the
somatic, lateralized pain settles at McBurney’s point, ⅔ of the way along from the
umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine.
These principles also help us understand patterns of referred pain. In pneumo-
nia, the T9 dermatome is shared by the lung and the abdomen. Also, irritation of
the underside of the diaphragm (sensory innervation is from above through the
phrenic nerve, C3–5) by an infl amed gallbladder or a subphrenic abscess refers pain
to the right shoulder: dermatomes C3–5.

Obstruction of the bowel
Cardinal features of intestinal obstruction •Vomiting,9 nausea and anorexia.•Colic
occurs early ( in long-standing obstruction). •Constipation may be absolute (ie no
faeces or fl atus passed) in distal obstruction; less pronounced if obstruction is high.
•Abdominal distension  as the obstruction progresses with active, ‘tinkling’ bowel
sounds.
The key decisions
1 Is it obstruction of the small or large bowel? In small bowel obstruction, vomiting
occurs early, distension is less, and pain is higher in the abdomen; in large bowel
obstruction, pain is more constant. The AXR plays a key role (fi g 13.28 & p728).
2 Is there an ileus or mechanical obstruction? Ileus is functional obstruction from
bowel motility (see BOX ‘Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?’ & p728). Bowel
sounds are absent; pain tends to be less.
3 Is the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated? Simple: one obstruct-
ing point and no vascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg
sigmoid volvulus) forming a loop of grossly distended bowel at risk of perforation.
Strangulated: blood supply is compromised and the patient is iller than you would
expect. There is sharper, more constant, and localized pain. Peritonism is the cardi-
nal sign. There may be fever + WCC with other signs of mesenteric ischaemia (p620).
Causes See table 13.12.
Table 13.12 Causes of bowel obstruction
Causes: small bowel Causes: large bowel Rarer causes
• Adhesions (p581) • Colon ca (p616) • Crohn’s stricture
• Hernias (p612) • Constipation (p260) • Gallstone ileus (p634)
• Diverticular stricture • Intussusception
• Volvulus • TB (developing world)
• Sigmoid (see BOX ‘Sigmoid • Foreign body
volvulus’)
• Caecal
Management
• General principles: Cause, site, speed of onset, and completeness of obstruction
determine defi nitive therapy: strangulation and large bowel obstruction require
surgery; ileus and incomplete small bowel obstruction can be managed conserva-
tively, at least initially.
• Immediate action: ‘Drip and suck’—NGT and IV fl uids to rehydrate and correct
electrolyte imbalance (p668). Being NBM does not give adequate rest for the bowel
because it can produce up to 9L of fl uid/d. Also: analgesia, blood tests (inc. amylase,
FBC, U&E), AXR, erect CXR, catheterize to monitor fl uid status.
• Further imaging: CT to establish the cause of obstruction (may show dilated, fl uid-
fi lled bowel and a transition zone at the site of obstruction—fi gs 13.29, 13.30). Oral
Gastrografi n® prior to CT can help identify level of obstruction and may have mild
therapeutic action against mechanical obstruction. Consider investigating the cause
of large bowel obstruction by colonoscopy but beware risk of perforation.
• Surgery: Strangulation needs emergency surgery. Closed loop obstruction may
be managed with surgery or endoscopic decompression attempted. Endoscopic
stenting may be used for obstructing large bowel malignancies either in palliation
or as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction (p616). Small bowel obstruction
secondary to adhesions should rarely lead to surgery—see BOX, p581.
9 Fermentation of the intestinal contents in established obstruction causes ‘faeculent’ vomiti ng. True ‘fae-
cal’ vomiting is found when there is a colonic fi stula with the proximal gut.

Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?
Paralytic ileus is adynamic bowel due to the absence of normal peristaltic con-
tractions. Contributing factors include abdominal surgery, pancreatitis (or any
localized peritonitis), spinal injury, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, uraemia, perito-
neal sepsis and drugs (eg tricyclic antidepressants).
Pseudo-obstruction resembles mechanical GI obstruction but with no obstruct-
ing lesion. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is called Ogilvie’s syndrome (p706),
and clinical features are similar to that of mechanical obstruction. Predisposing
factors: puerperium; pelvic surgery; trauma; cardiorespiratory and neurological
disorders. Treatment: Neostigmine or colonoscopic decompression are sometimes
useful. In chronic pseudo-obstruction weight loss from malabsorption is a problem.
Sigmoid volvulus
Sigmoid volvulus occurs when the bowel twists on its mesentery, which can pro-
duce severe, rapid, strangulated obstruction (fi g 13.28c). It tends to occur in the
elderly, constipated, and comorbid patient, and is managed by insertion of a fl atus
tube or sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoid colectomy is sometimes required. If not treated
successfully, it can progress to perforation and fatal peritonitis.

Abdominal hernias
Defi nition The protrusion of a viscus or part of a viscus through a defect of the
walls of its containing cavity into an abnormal position. See fi g 13.31. Terminology:
• Irreducible: contents cannot be pushed back into place (see p614 for technique).
• Obstructed: bowel contents cannot pass—features of intestinal obstruction (p610).
• Strangulated: ischaemia occurs—the patient requires urgent surgery.
• Incarceration: contents of the hernial sac are stuck inside by adhesions.
Care must be taken with reduction as it is possible to push an incarcerated hernia
back into the abdominal cavity, giving the initial appearance of successful reduction.
Inguinal hernia The commonest type in both  &  (but >>), p614.
Femoral hernia Bowel enters the femoral canal, presenting as a mass
in the upper medial thigh or above the inguinal ligament where it points
down the leg, unlike an inguinal hernia which points to the groin. They oc-
cur more often in  especially in middle age and the elderly. They are likely
to be irreducible and to strangulate due to the rigidity of the canal’s borders.
Anatomy:See fi g 13..32 Differential diagnosis: (See p651.) 1 Inguinal hernia.
2 Saphena varix. 3 An enlarged Cloquet’s node (p615). 4 Lipoma. 5 Femoral aneurysm.
6 Psoas abscess. Treatment: Surgical repair is recommended. Herniotomy is ligation
and excision of the sac, herniorrhaphy is repair of the hernial defect.
Paraumbilical hernias occur just above or below the umbilicus. Risk factors are
obesity and ascites. Omentum or bowel herniates through the defect. Surgery in-
volves repair of the rectus sheath (Mayo repair).
Epigastric hernias pass through linea alba above the umbilicus.
Incisional hernias follow breakdown of muscle closure after surgery (11–20%). If
obese, repair is not easy. Mesh repair has recurrence but infection over sutures.
Spigelian hernias occur through the linea semilunaris at the lateral edge of the
rectus sheath, below and lateral to the umbilicus.
Lumbar hernias occur through the inferior or superior lumbar triangles in the pos-
terior abdominal wall.
Richter’s hernias involve bowel wall only—not the whole lumen.
Maydl’s hernias involve a herniating ‘double loop’ of bowel. The strangulated por-
tion may reside as a single loop inside the abdominal cavity.
Littré’s hernias are hernial sacs containing strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum.
Obturator hernias occur through the obturator canal. Typically there is pain along
the medial side of the thigh in a thin woman.
Sciatic hernias pass through the lesser sciatic foramen (a way through var ious
pelvic ligaments). GI obstruction + a gluteal mass suggests this rare possibility.
Sliding hernias contain a partially extraperitoneal structure (eg caecum on the
right, sigmoid colon on the left). The sac does not completely surround the contents.
Paediatric hernias include Umbilical hernias: (3% of live births). Are a result of a
persistent defect in the transversalis fascia. Surgical repair rarely needed as most
resolve by the age of 3. Indirect inguinal hernias (~ 4% of all  infants due to patent
processus vaginalis—prematurity is a risk factor; uncommon in  infants—consider
testicular feminization.) Surgical repair is required. Gastroschisis: Protrusion of the
abdominal contents through a defect in the anterior abdominal wall to the right of
the umbilicus. Prompt surgical repair required. Exomphalos: Abdominal contents
are found outside the abdomen, covered in a three-layer membrane consisting of
peritoneum, Wharton’s jelly, and amnion. Surgical repair less urgent because the
bowel is protected by these membranes.

Inguinal hernias
Indirect hernias pass through the internal inguinal ring and, if large, out through
the external ring (fi g. 13.33). Direct hernias push their way directly forward through
the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, into a defect in the abdominal wall (Hes-
selbach’s triangle; medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and lateral to the rectus
abdominus). Predisposing conditions: males (:≈8:1), chronic cough, constipation,
urinary obstruction, heavy lifting, ascites, past abdominal surgery (eg damage to the
iliohypogastric nerve during appendicectomy). There are two landmarks to identify:
the deep (internal) ring may be defi ned as being the mid-point of the inguinal liga-
ment, ~1½ cm above the femoral pulse (which crosses the mid-inguinal point); the
superfi cial (external) ring is a split in the external oblique aponeurosis just superior
and medial to the pubic tubercle (the bony prominence forming the medial attach-
ment of the inguinal ligament).
Examination Look for previous scars; feel the other side (more common on the
right); examine the external genitalia. Then ask: •Is the lump visible? If so, ask the
patient to reduce it—if he cannot, make sure that it is not a scrotal lump. Ask him
to cough. Appears above and medial to the pubic tubercle. •If no lump is visible,
feel for a cough impulse. •Repeat the examination with the patient standing. Dis-
tinguishing direct from indirect hernias: This is loved by examiners but is of little
clinical use—not least because repair is the same for both (see ‘Repairs’ later in
topic). The best way is to reduce the hernia and occlude the deep (internal) ring
with two fi ngers. Ask the patient to cough or stand—if the hernia is restrained, it is
indirect; if not, it is direct. The ‘gold standard’ for determining the type of inguinal
hernia is at surgery: direct hernias arise medial to the inferior epigastric vessels;
indirect hernias are lateral.
Indirect hernias: Direct hernias: Femoral hernias:
• Common (80%) • Less common (20%) • More frequent in females
• Can strangulate. • Reduce easily • Frequently irreducible
• Rarely strangulate. • Frequently strangulate.
Irreducible hernias You may be called because a long-standing hernia is now ir-
reducible and painful. It is always worth trying to reduce these yourself to prevent
strangulation and necrosis (demanding prompt laparotomy). Learn how to do this
from an expert, ie one of your patients who has been reducing his hernia for years.
Then you will know how to act correctly when the emergency presents. Notice that
such patients use the fl at of the hand, directing the hernia from below, up towards
the contralateral shoulder. Sometimes, as the hernia obstructs, reduction requires
perseverance, which may be rewarded by a gurgle from the retreating bowel and a
kiss from the attending spouse who had thought that surgery was inevitable.
Repairs Weight loss (if over-weight) and stop smoking pre-op. Warn that hernias
may recur and patients should be counselled about possibility of chronic pain post-
operatively. Mesh techniques (eg Lichtenstein repair) have replaced older methods.
In mesh repairs, a polypropylene mesh reinforces the posterior wall. Recurrence
rate is less than with other methods (eg <2% vs 10%). (CI: strangulated hernias, con-
tamination with pus/bowel contents.) Local anaesthetic techniques and day-case
‘ambulatory’ surgery may halve the price of surgery. This is important because this
is one of the most common operations (>100 000 per year in the UK). Laparoscopic
repair gives similar recurrence rates. Methods include transabdominal pre-perito-
neal (TAPP) in which the peritoneum is entered and the hernia repaired, and totally
extraperitoneal (TEP), which decreases the risk of visceral injury. For benefi ts of lapa-
roscopic surgery see p592.
Return to work: Will depend upon surgical approach and patient—discuss this pre-
operatively. Rest for 4wks and convalescence over 8wks with open approaches, but
laparoscopic repairs may allow return to manual work (and driving) after ≤2wks if
all is well.

• Vas deferens, obliterated processus vaginalis, and lymphatics.
• Arteries to the vas, cremaster, and testis.
• The pampiniform plexus and the venous equivalent of the above.
• The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve and sympathetic nerves.
• The ilioinguinal nerve, which enters the inguinal canal via the anterior wall and
runs anteriorly to the cord.

Colorectal carcinoma
This is the 3rd most common cancer and 2nd most common cause of UK cancer
deaths (16 000 deaths/yr). Usually adenocarcinoma. 86% of presentations are in
those >60yrs old. Lifetime UK incidence:  = 1 : 15;  = 1 : 19.
Predisposing factors Neoplastic polyps (see BOX & p520); IBD (UC and Crohn’s);
genetic predisposition (<8%), eg FAP and HNPCC (see p521); diet (low-fi bre; red and
processed meat); alcohol ; smoking; previous cancer. Prevention: While routine
chemoprevention is not currently recommended due to gastrointestinal SES, aspirin
≥75mg/d reduces incidence and mortality.
Presentation depends on site: Left-sided: Bleeding/mucus PR; altered bowel habit
or obstruction (25%); tenesmus; mass PR (60%). Right: Weight; Hb; abdominal
pain; obstruction less likely. Either: Abdominal mass; perforation; haemorrhage;
fi stula. See p522 for a guide to urgent referral criteria. See fi g 13.34 for distribution.
Tests FBC (microcytic anaemia); faecal occult blood (FOB, see BOX); sigmoidoscopy or
colonoscopy (fi gs 6.7 & 6.8, p249), which can be done ‘virtually’ by CT (fi g 16.31, p743); LFT;
liver MRI/US. CEA (p531) may be used to monitor disease and eff ectiveness of treatment.
If family history of FAP, refer for DNA test once >15yrs old.
Spread Local, lymphatic, by blood (liver, lung, bone) or transcoelomic. The TNM sys-
tem (Tumour, Node, Metastases see table 13.13 and p523) is used to stage disease
and is preferred to the older Dukes’ classifi cation (Dukes A: limited to muscularis
mucosae; Dukes B: extension through muscularis mucosae; Dukes C: involvement of
regional lymph nodes).
Surgery aims to cure and may  survival times by up to 50%. In elective surgery,
anastomosis is typically achieved at the 1st operation. Laparoscopic surgery has
revolutionized surgery for colon cancer. It is as safe as open surgery and there is no
diff erence in overall survival or disease recurrence. •Right hemicolectomy for caecal,
ascending, or proximal transverse colon tumours. •Left hemicolectomy for tumours in
distal transverse or descending colon. •Sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid tumours. •An-
terior resection for low sigmoid or high rectal tumours. •Abdomino-perineal (AP) re-
section for tumours low in the rectum (8cm from anus): permanent colostomy and
removal of rectum and anus. •Hartmann’s procedure in emergency bowel obstruc-
tion, perforation, or palliation (p582). •Transanal endoscopic microsurgery allows
local excision through a wide proctoscope for localized rectal disease. Endoscopic
stenting should be considered for palliation in malignant obstruction and as a bridge
to surgery in acute obstruction. Stenting  need for colostomy, has less complica-
tions than emergency surgery, shortens intensive care and total hospital stays, and
prevents unnecessary opera tions. Surgery with liver resection may be curative if
single-lobe hepatic metastases and no extrahepatic spread.
Radiotherapy is mostly used in palliation for colonic cancer. It is occasionally used
pre-op in rectal cancer to allow resection. Post-op radiotherapy is only used in pa-
tients with rectal tumours at high risk of local recurrence.
Chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage 3 disease has been shown to re-
duce disease recurrence by 30% and mortality by 25%. Benefi ts for stage 2 disease
are more marginal and warrant an individualized approach. The FOLFOX regimen has
become standard (fl uorouracil, folinic acid and oxaliplatin). Chemotherapy is also
used in palliation of metastatic disease. Biological therapies: Bevacizumab (anti-
VEGF antibody) improves survival when added to combination therapy in advanced
disease. Cetuximab and panitumumab (anti-EGFR agents) improve response rate
and survival in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.
Prognosis Survival is dependent on age and stage; for stage 1 disease, 5yr survival
is ~75% but this drops to just 5% with diagnosis at stage 4, hence the imperative for
eff ective screening (BOX).

TNM status used to defi ne overall stage. This is complex with several important
subtypes, but in essence, stage 1 disease is T1 or T2/N0/M0; stage 2 is T3 or T4/N0/M0;
stage 3 is characterized by N1 or N2 but still M0; stage 4 is M1.
Polyps, the challenges of screening, and the NHS
Polyps are growths that appear above the mucosa and can be infl ammatory,
hamartomatous, or neoplastic. Left in situ, polyps carry a risk of malignant trans-
formation that will relate to size and histology (tubular or villous adenomas, esp.
if >2cm). Patients with polyps may have no symptoms and thus a colonoscopy is
required to detect and remove. Colonscopy allows the opportunity to detect colo-
rectal cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more eff ective.
However, population-based colonoscopic screening is costly and some studies
have suggested that the test does not impact on deaths from right-sided can-
cers which are rarer and harder to detect (fi g 13.34). Therefore, the NHS has intro-
duced a one-off screening fl exible sigmoidoscopy off ered to all people in their 55th
year. Trial results have shown the incidence of colorectal cancer in the intervention
(screening) group is reduced by 33% and mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced
by 43%. Number needed to screen to prevent one diagnosis (=191); or death (=489).
In parallel, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (introduced in 2006) of-
fers colonoscopy to all men and women aged 60–75 who test positive for faecal
occult blood (FOB) using a home testing kit performed every 2 years. This FOB-
stratifi cation targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting
detection of more advanced adenomas and early stage cancers. The relative risk
of death from colorectal cancer in patients undergoing screening is reduced by
16%. A 11% increase in incidence rates since 2006 for people aged 60–69 is almost
certainly due to earlier detection through the screening programme.

Carcinoma of the oesophagus
Incidence Australia <5/100 000/yr; UK <9; Iran >100. Risk factors: Diet, alcohol ex-
cess, smoking, achalasia, refl ux oesophagitis ± Barrett’s oesophagus (p695); obesity,
hot drinks, nitrosamine exposure, Plummer–Vinson syndrome (p250).  :  ≈ 5 : 1.
Site 20% occur in the upper part, 50% in the middle, and 30% in the lower part.
They may be squamous cell (proximal) or adenocarcinomas (distal; incidence rising).
Presentation Dysphagia; weight; retrosternal chest pain. Signs from the upper
third of the oesophagus: Hoarseness; cough (may be paroxysmal if aspiration pneu-
monia). : See ‘Dysphagia’, p250.
Tests Oesophagoscopy with biopsy is the investigation of choice ± EUS, CT/MRI for stag-
ing (fi g 13.35), or laparoscopy if signifi cant infra-diaphragmatic component. Staging:
See table 13.14.
Treatment Survival rates are poor with or without treatment. If localized T1/T2
disease, radical curative oesophagectomy may be tried. Pre-op chemotherapy (cis-
platin + fl uorouracil) for localized disease may improve survival, but causes some
morbidity. If surgery is not indicated, then chemor adiotherapy may be better than
radiotherapy alone. Palliation in advanced disease aims to restore swallowing with
chemo/radiotherapy, stenting, and laser use.
TNM staging in oesophageal cancer
Spread of oesophageal cancer is direct, by submucosal infi ltration and local
spread—or to nodes, or, later, via the blood.

Carcinoma of the stomach
Incidence of adenocarcinoma at the gastro-oesophageal junction is increasing in the
West, though incidence of distal and gastric body carcinoma has fallen sharply. It
remains a tumour notable for its gloomy prognosis and non-specifi c presentation.
Incidence 23/100 000/yr in the UK, but there are unexplained wide geographical
variations; it is espe cially common in Japan, as well as Eastern Europe, China, and
South America.  :  ≈ 2 : 1. Risk factors: Pernicious anaemia, blood group A, H. pylori
(p252), atrophic gastritis, adenomatous polyps, lower social class, smoking, diet (high
nitrate, high salt, pickling, low vitamin C), nitrosamine exposure.
Pathology A range of clinical and histological classifi cations are in use. Of note, ‘early’
gastric carcinoma (confi ned to mucosa and submucosa) carries a better prognosis
with endoscopic resection often possible.
Presentation Symptoms: Often non-specifi c. Dyspepsia (p59; age ≥55yrs with
treatment-refractory symptoms demands investigation), weight, vomiting, dyspha-
gia, anaemia. Signs suggesting incurable disease: epigastric mass, hepatomegaly;
jaundice, ascites (p604); large left supraclavicular (Virchow’s) node (=Troisier’s sign);
acanthosis nigricans (p562). Most patients in the West present with locally advanced
(inoperable) or metastatic disease. Spread is local, lymphatic, blood-borne, and
transcoelomic, eg to ovaries (Krukenberg tumour).
Tests Gastroscopy + multiple ulcer edge biopsies. Aim to biopsy all gastric ul-
cers as even malignant ulcers may appear to heal on drug treatment. Endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) can evaluate depth of invasion; CT/MRI helps staging. Staging lapa-
roscopy is recommended for locally advanced tumours. Cytology of peritoneal wash-
ings can help identify peritoneal metastases.
Treatment See p622 for a description of surgical resections. Early gastric cancers
may be resectable endoscopically (endoscopic mucosal resection). Partial gastrec-
tomy may suffi ce for more advanced distal tumours. If proximal, total gast rectomy
may be needed. Combination chemotherapy (eg epirubicin, cisplatin and fl uorouracil)
appears to increase survival in advanced disease. If given perioperatively in operable
disease it improves survival compared to surgery alone. Surgical palliation is often
needed for obstruction, pain, or haemorrhage. In locally advanced and metastatic
disease, chemotherapy increases quality of life and survival. Targeted therapies are
likely to have an increasing role, eg trastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumours.
5yr survival <10% overall, but nearly 20% for patients undergoing radical surgery.
The prognosis is much better for ‘early’ gastric carcinoma.
Bile duct and gallbladder cancers
All are rare, have an overall poor prognosis, and are diffi cult to diagnose. They ac-
count for ~3% of all GI cancers worldwide, but there is geographical variation ( in
north-east Thailand, Japan, Korea, and Eastern Europe). Most are adenocarcino-
mas. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (p282) is the commonest predisposing factor in
the West. Presentation: Varies according to location and may include obstructive
jaundice, pruritus, abdominal pain, weight loss, and anorexia. Investigations: US, CT,
and ERCP. MRI has a role for determining extent of invasion in bile duct cancers.
Treatment:
• Bile duct cancer: surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment
yet ~80% present with inoperable disease. Palliation includes biliary stenting
and chemotherapy.
• Gallbladder cancer: again, radical surgery is the only chance of cure. Patients
with a calcified (‘porcelain’) gallbladder have an increased risk of cancer—pro-
phylactic surgery should be considered. Palliative treatment of inoperable dis-
ease includes biliary stenting and chemotherapy.

Bowel ischaemia
There are three main types of bowel ischaemia: AF with abdominal pain should
always prompt thoughts of mesenteric ischaemia.
1 Acute mesenteric ischaemia almost always involves the small bowel and may
follow superior mesenteric artery (SMA; fi g 13.36) thrombosis (~35%) or embolism
(~35%), mesenteric vein thrombosis (~5%; younger patients with hypercoagulable
states—tends to aff ect smaller lengths of bowel), or non-occlusive disease (~20%;
occurs in low-fl ow states and usually refl ects poor cardiac output, though there may
be other factors such as recent cardiac surgery or renal failure). Other causes include
trauma, vasculitis (p556), radiotherapy, or strangulation (volvulus or hernia, p612).
Presentation is a classical clinical triad: acute severe abdominal pain; no/minimal
abdominal signs; rapid hypovolaemiashock. Pain tends to be constant, central, or
around the RIF. The degree of illness is often far out of proportion with clinical signs.
Tests: There may be Hb (due to plasma loss), WCC, modestly raised plasma am-
ylase, and a persistent metabolic acidosis (high lactate). Early on, the abdominal
x-ray shows a ‘gasless’ abdomen. CT/MR may show evidence of ischaemia with CT/MR
angiography or formal arteriography if doubt remains. Often the diganosis is made
on fi nding a nasty, necrotic bowel at laparotomy.
Treatment: The main life-threatening complications secondary to acute mesenteric
ischaemia are 1 septic peritonitis and 2 progression of a systemic infl ammatory re-
sponse syndrome (SIRS) to multi-organ failure, mediated by bacterial translocation
across the dying gut wall. Resuscitation with fl uid, antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazo-
bactam, see table 9.3, p386), and, usually, LMWH/heparin are required. If arteriogra-
phy is done, thrombolytics may be infused locally via the catheter. At surgery, dead
bowel must be removed. Revascularization may be attempted on potentially viable
bowel but it is a diffi cult process and often needs a 2nd laparotomy.
Prognosis: Poor for arterial thrombosis and non-occlusive disease (<40% survive),
though not so bad for venous and embolic ischaemia.
2 Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (AKA intestinal angina.) The triad of severe, colicky
post-prandial abdominal pain (‘gut claudication’), weight (eating hurts), and an up-
per abdominal bruit may be present ± PR bleeding, malabsoprtion, and N&V. Typically
brought about through a combination of a low-fl ow state with atheroma (95% due to
diff use atherosclerotic disease in all three mesenteric arteries). It is rare and diffi cult
to diagnose. Tests: CT angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography are replac-
ing traditional angiography. Treatment: Once diagnosis is confi rmed, surgery should
be considered due to the ongoing risk of acute infarction. Percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty and stent insertion has replaced open revascularization. It is associated
with less post-operative morbidity and mortality, but has higher restenosis rates.
3 Chronic colonic ischaemia (AKA ischaemic colitis) usually follows low fl ow in the
inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) territory and ranges from mild ischaemia to gan-
grenous colitis. Presentation: Lower left-sided abdominal pain ± bloody diarrhoea.
Tests: CT may be helpful but lower GI endoscopy is ‘gold-standard’. Treatment: Usu-
ally conservative with fl uid replacement and antibiotics. Most recover but subse-
quent development of ischaemic strictures is common. Gangrenous ischaemic colitis
(presenting with peritonitis and hypovolaemic shock) requires prompt resuscitation
followed by resection of the aff ected bowel and stoma formation. Mortality is high.

Gastric surgery and its aftermath
Indications for gastric surgery include gastric cancer (p619) and perforated/
haemorrhaging peptic ulcers. Medical therapy (p252) for peptic ulcers has made
elective surgery exceedingly rare/redundant. Emergency surgery may be needed
for haemorrhage or perforation. Haemorr hage is usually treated by under-running
the bleeding ulcer base or excision of the ulcer. If the former is done, then a biopsy
should be taken to exclude malignancy. Perforation is usually managed by excision
of the hole for histology, then closure.
Gastric carcinoma Localized disease may be treated by curative gastrectomy. Le-
sions in the proximal third or extensive infi ltrative disease require total gastrectomy,
while lesions in the distal two-thirds can be treated with a partial gastrectomy. Lapa-
roscopic surgery may be as eff ective and safe as open surgery in specialist centres.
Surgery: Billroth I: Partial gastrectomy with simple gastroduodenal re-anastomosis.
Billroth II (AKA Polya) gastrectomy: (fi g 13.37) Partial gastrectomy with gastroje-
junal anastomosis. The duodenal stump is oversewn (leaving a blind aff erent loop),
and anastomosis is achieved by a longitud inal incision into the proximal jejunum.
Roux-en-Y: (fi g 13.38) Following total or subtotal gastrectomy, the proximal duodenal
stump is oversewn, the proximal jejunum is divided from the distal duodenum and con-
nects with the oesophagus (or proximal stomach after subtotal gastrectomy), while
the distal duodenum is connected to the distal jejunum.
Lymph node clearance is a controversial area. RCTS and meta-analyses suggest there
may be limited benefi t and increased morbidity associated with extended lymph
node resections (D2 or D3) over resection limited to the perigastric nodes (D1).
Physical complications of gastrectomy
• Abdominal fullness: Feeling of early satiety (± discomfort and distension) im-
proving with time. Advise to take small, frequent meals.
• Afferent loop syndrome: Post-gastrectomy (eg Billroth II), the aff erent loop
may fi ll with bile after a meal, causing upper abdominal pain and bilious vomit-
ing. This is diffi cult to treat—but often improves with time.
• Diarrhoea: May be disabling after vagotomy. Codeine phosphate may help.
• Gastric tumour: A rare complication of any surgery which  acid production.
• Amylase: If with abdominal pain, this may indicate aff erent loop obstruction
after Billroth II surgery and requires emergency surgery.
Metabolic complications
• Dumping syndrome: Fainting and sweating after eating due to food of high os-
motic potential being dumped in the jejunum, causing oligaemia from rapid fl uid
shifts. ‘Late dumping’ is due to rebound hypoglycaemia and occurs 1–3h after
meals. Both tend to improve with time but may be helped by eating less sugar,
and more guar gum and pectin (slows glucose absorption). Acarbose may also
help to reduce the early hyperglycaemic stimulus to insulin secretion.
• Weight loss: Often due to poor calorie intake.
• Bacterial overgrowth ± malabsorption (blind loop syndrome) may occur.
• Anaemia: Usually from lack of iron, hypochlorhydria, and stomach resection. B12
levels are frequently low but megaloblastic anaemia is rare.
• Osteomalacia: There may be pseudofractures which look like metastases.

Theodor Billroth
Theodor Billroth was a surgeon of German-Austrian origin, whose name lives on
as a set of operations on the stomach. He was a pioneer of abdominal surgery and
the use of aseptic techniques, performing the fi rst Billroth I procedure in 1881 for
the resection of a pyloric gastric carcinoma. Among the many of his remarkable
achievements is included the fi rst laryngectomy. He was also a talented musician (a
close friend of Brahms) and a dedicated educator with something of a realist’s view
of the world:
‘The pleasure of a physician is little, the gratitude of patients is rare, and even
rarer is material reward, but these things will never deter the student who feels
the call within him.’ Theodor Billroth (1829–94).

Fundoplication for gastro-oesophageal refl ux
Laparoscopic fundoplication is the surgical procedure of choice when symptoms of
GORD are refractory to medical therapy and there is severe refl ux (confi rmed by pH-
monitoring)—see p254. Symptoms may be complicated by a hiatus hernia, which is
repaired during the procedure.
Surgery The defect in the diaphragm is repaired by tightening the crura. Refl ux is
prevented by wrapping the gastric fundus around the lower oesophageal sphinc-
ter—see fi g 13.39. There are various types of procedure, eg Nissen (360° wrap),
Toupet (270° posterior wrap), Watson (anterior hemifundoplication). Laparoscopic
surgery is at least as eff ective at controlling refl ux as open surgery but with a lower
mortality and morbidity. Wound infections and respiratory complications are also
more common in open surgery, though the incidence of dysphagia is similar for the
two procedures—but see p592.
Complications Dysphagia (if the wrap is too tight), ‘gas-bloat syndrome’ (inability
to belch/vomit), and new-onset diarrhoea.

Oesophageal rupture
Causes •Iatrogenic, eg endoscopy/biopsy/dilatation (accounts for 85–90% of per-
forations). •Trauma, eg penetrating injury/ingestion of foreign body. •Carcinoma
•Boerhaave syndrome—rupture due to violent vomiting. •Corrosive ingestion.
Clinical features Odynophagia, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, fever, shock, surgical em-
physema (a crackling sensation felt on palpating the skin over the chest or neck
caused by air tracking from the lungs.  : Pneumothorax).
 Iatrogenic perforations are less prone to mediastinitis and sepsis and may be man-
aged conservatively with NG tube, PPI, and antibiotics. Others require resuscitation,
PPI, antibiotics, antifungals, and surgery (debridement of mediastinum and place-
ment of T-tube for drainage and formation of a controlled oesophago-cutaneous
fi stula).

Surgical management of obesity
Severe obesity is increasing in prevalence worldwide and is associated with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM); hypertension; ischaemic heart disease; sleep apnoea; osteo-
arthritis; and depression. Bariatric surgery has become very successful at weight
reduction, symptom improvement, and improving quality of life. Surgery increases
life expectancy by around 3 years (but may not prolong survival in high-risk men).
Indications: According to NICE guidelines,9 weight-loss surgery in adults should be
considered if all the following criteria are met:
1 BMI ≥40 (or ≥35 with signifi cant comorbidities that could improve with weight).
2 Failure of non-surgical management to achieve and maintain clinically benefi cial
weight loss for 6 months.
3 Fitness for surgery and anaesthesia.
4 Intensive management in tier 3 service (provides guidance on diet, physical ac-
tivity, and psychosocial concerns, as well as lifelong medical monitoring).
5 The patient must be well informed and motivated.
If BMI ≥50, or in newly diagnosed T2DM with BMI ≥30, surgery is recommended as
fi rst-line treatment.
Comparison with medical therapy Surgery is more eff ective in achieving weight
loss than non-surgical management and weight loss is more likely to be maintained
in the longer term. Adverse events are more common following surgery, and vary
from one procedure to another.
Procedures There are two main mechanisms causing weight loss: 1 Restriction of
calorie intake by reducing stomach capacity. 2 Malabsorption of nutrients by reduc-
ing the length of functional small bowel. NB: This also aff ects the levels of circulating
gut peptides (eg PYY and GLP-1), which are thought to play a role in the mechanism of
satiety and weight loss. Choose surgical intervention jointly with patient:
• Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB): This restrictive technique creates a
pre-stomach pouch by placing a silicone band around the top of the stomach, which
serves as a new smaller stomach. The band can be adjusted by addition or removal of
saline through a subcutaneous port (see fi g 13.40). LAGB is associated with improve-
ments in comorbidities and quality of life. Weight loss is slower and less than with
gastric bypass but there is lower mortality and fewer complications. Relatively non-
invasive and band removal possible. Complications: pouch enlargement, band slip,
band erosion, and port infection/breakage.
• Sleeve gastrectomy: (fi g 13.41) Involves division of the stomach vertically, reduc-
ing it in size by about 75%. The pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach is left
intact so function and digestion are unaltered. The procedure is not reversible
and may be a fi rst stage for progression to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or duodenal
switch in very obese patients where a single-stage procedure would be technically
diffi cult or unsafe.
• Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: (fi g 13.42) Laparoscopic or open. A portion of the jeju-
num is attached to a small stomach pouch to allow food to bypass the distal stom-
ach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. It can be performed laparoscopically and
works by both restriction and malabsorption. Mean excess weight loss at 5 years
is 62.8%. Current evidence demonstrates greater weight loss, greater resolution of
comorbidities, and lower reoperation rates compared to LAGB. Complications: mi-
cronutrient defi ciency (requires vitamin supplementation and lifelong follow-up/
blood tests), dumping syndrome, wound infection, hernias, malabsorption, diar-
rhoea, and a mortality of <0.5% (at experienced centres).

Diverticular disease
A GI diverticulum is an outpouching of the gut wall, usually at sites of entry of
perforating arteries. Diverticulosis means that diverticula are present, and diver-
ticular disease implies they are symptomatic. Diverticulitis refers to infl ammation
of a diverticulum. Diverticula can be aquired or congenital and may occur elsewhere,
but the most important are acquired colonic diverticula, to which this page refers.
Pathology Most within sigmoid colon with 95% of complications at this site, but
right-sided and massive single diverticula can occur. High intraluminal pressures
(due, perhaps, to lack of dietary fi bre) force the mucosa to herniate through the
muscle layers of the gut at weak points adjacent to penetrating vessels. 30% of
Westerners have diverticulosis by age 60. The majority are asymptomatic.
Diagnosis Diverticula are a common incidental fi nding at colonoscopy (fi g 6.11, p249).
CT abdomen is best to confi rm acute diverticulitis and can identify extent of disease
and any complications (eg colovesical fi stulae). Colonoscopy risk perforation in acute
setting. AXR may identify obstruction or free air (perforation).
Diverticular disease Altered bowel habit ± left-sided colic relieved by defecation;
nausea and fl atulence. High-fi bre diets do not help symptoms; try antispasmodics,
eg mebeverine 135mg/8h PO. Surgical resection occasionally resorted to.
Diverticulitis features above + pyrexia, WCC, CRP/ESR, a tender colon ± localized or
generalized peritonism. Mild attacks can be treated at home with bowel rest (fl uids
only) ± antibiotics. If fl uids and pain not tolerated, admit for analgesia, NBM, IV fl uids
and IV antibiotics. Most attacks settle but complications include abscess formation
(neces sitating percutaneous CT-guided drainage), or perforation. Beware diverticu-
litis in immunocompromised patients (eg on steroids) who often have few symptoms
and may present late.
Surgery The need for surgery is refl ected by the degree of infective complications:
Stage 1 Pericolic or mesenteric abscess Surgery rarely needed
Stage 2 Walled off or pelvic abscess May resolve without surgery
Stage 3 Generalized purulent peritonitis Surgery required
Stage 4 Generalized faecal peritonitis Surgery required
Indications for elective surgery include stenosis, fi stulae, or recurrent bleeding.
Complications Perforation: There is ileus, peritonitis ± shock. Mortality: 40%.
Manage as for an acute abdomen. At laparotomy a Hartmann’s procedure may be
performed (p582). Primary anastomosis is possible in selected patients. Emergency
laparoscopic management is an emerging alternative.
• Haemorrhage is usually sudden and painless. It is a common cause of big rectal
bleeds (p629). Embolization (at angiography) or colonic resection only necessary
if ongoing massive bleeding and colonoscopic haemostasis has been unsuccessful.
• Fistulae: Enterocolic, colovaginal, or colovesical (pneumaturia ± intractable UTIS).
Treatment is surgical, eg colonic resection.
• Abscesses, eg with swinging fever, leucocytosis, and localizing signs, eg boggy
rectal mass (pelvic abscess—drain rectally). If no localizing signs, remember the
aphorism: pus somewhere, pus nowhere = pus under the diaphragm. A sub-
phrenic abscess is a horrible way to die, so do an urgent ultrasound. Antibiotics ±
ultrasound/CT-guided drainage may be needed.
• Post-infective strictures may form in the sigmoid colon.

Rectal bleeding—an acute management plan
Causes Diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, IBD, perianal disease, an-
giodyplasia (submucosal arteriovenous malformations, typically elderly). Rarities:
trauma, ischaemia colitis, radiation proctitis, aorto-enteric fi stula.
An acute mana gement plan for this common surgical event:
 ABC resuscitation, if necessary.
 History and examination.
 Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting, amyl ase (always thinking of pancreatitis),
CRP, group and save—await Hb result before crossmatching unless unstable and
bleeding.
 Imaging: May only need plain AXR, but if there are signs of perforation (eg sepsis,
peritonism) or if there is cardiorespiratory comorbidity, then request an erect CXR.
 Fluid management: Insert 2 cannulae (≥18G) into the antecubital fossae. Insert
a urinary catheter if there is a suspicion of haemodynamic comprom ise—there
is no absolute indication, but remember that you are weighing up the risks and
benefi ts. Give crystalloid as replacement and maintenance IVI. Blood transfu-
sion only if signifi cant blood loss (table 13.10, p607).
 Clotting: Withold ± reverse anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents (p351).
 Antibiotics may occasionally be required if there is evidence of sepsis or perfo-
ration, eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV.
 Keep bedbound: The patient may feel the need to get out of bed to pass stool,
but this could be another large bleed, resulting in collapse if they try to walk.
Don’t allow them to mobilize and inform the nursing staff of this.
 Start a stool chart to monitor volume and frequency of motions. Send a sample
for MC&S (x3 if known to have compromising comorbidity such as IBD).
 Diet: Keep on clear fl uids so that they can have something, yet the colon will be
as clear as possible if colonoscopy required.
 Interventions if bleeding not settling with conservative management: Angi-
ography may allow localization of bleeding (eg sigmoid diverticulum or right
sided angiodysplasia) as well as therapeutic embolization; CT angiography is
a non-invasive alternative (without interventional options); colonoscopy may
permit endoscopic haemostasis.
 Surgery: The main indication for this is unremitting, massive bleeding that is not
controlled by other means.

Perianal problems
Pruritus ani Itch occurs if the anus is moist/soiled; fi ssures, incontinence, poor hy-
giene, tight pants, threadworm, fi stula, dermatoses, lichen sclerosis, anxiety, contact
dermatitis (perfumed goods). Cause is often unknown. : Avoid scratching, perianal
hygiene, avoid foods which loosen stools. Soothing ointment, mild topical corticos-
teroid if perinanal infl ammation (max 2wks), oral antihistamine for noctural itch.
Fissure-in-ano Painful tear in the squamous lining of the lower anal canal—often, if
chronic, with a ‘sentinel pile’ or mucosal tag at the external aspect. 90% are posterior
(anterior ones follow parturition). >. Causes: Most are due to hard faeces. Spasm
may constrict the inferior rectal artery, causing ischaemia, making healing diffi cult
and perpetuating the problem. Rare causes (multiple ± lateral): syphilis; herpes;
trauma; Crohn’s; anal cancer; psoriasis. Groin nodes suggest a complicating factor
(eg immunosuppression/HIV). : 5% lidocaine ointment + GTN ointment (0.2–0.4%) or
topical diltiazem (2%) ; dietary fi bre, fl uids, stool softener, and hygiene advice. Botu-
linum toxin injection (2nd line) and topical diltiazem (2%) are at least as eff ective as
GTN with fewer side-eff ects. If conservative measures fail, surgical options include
lateral partial internal sphincterotomy.
Fistula-in-ano A track communicates between the skin and anal canal/rectum.
Blockage of deep intramuscular gland ducts is thought to predispose to the forma-
tion of abscesses, which discharge to form the fi stula. Goodsall’s rule determines
the path of the fi stula track: if anterior, the track is in a straight line (radial); if poste-
rior, the internal opening is always at the 6 o’clock position, taking a tortuous course.
Causes: perianal sepsis, abscesses (see later in topic), Crohn’s disease, TB, diverticu-
lar disease, rectal carcinoma, immunocompromise. Tests: MRI; endoanal US scan. :
Fistulot omy + excision. High fi stulae (involving continence muscles of anus) require
‘seton suture’ tightened over time to maintain continence; low fi stulae are ‘laid open’
to heal by secondary intention—division of sphincters poses no risk to continence.
Anorectal abscesses Usually caused by gut organisms (rarely staphs or TB). :≈1:8.
Perianal (~45%), ischiorectal (≤30%), intersphincteric (>20%), supralevator (~5%)
(fi g 13.43). : Incise & drain under GA. Associations: DM, Crohn’s, malignancy, fi stulae.
Perianal haematoma (AKA thrombosed external pile—see p633). Strictly, it is actu-
ally a clotted venous saccule. It appears as a 2–4mm ‘dark blueberry’ under the skin
at the anal margin. It may be evacuated under LA or left to resolve spontaneously.
Pilonidal sinus Obstruction of natal cleft hair follicles ~6cm above the anus. In-
growing of hair excites a foreign body reaction and may cause secondary tracks to
open laterally ± abscesses, with foul-smelling discharge. (Barbers get these between
fi ngers.) :≈10:1. Obese Caucasians and those from Asia, the Middle East, and
Mediterranean at risk. : Excision of the sinus tract ± primary closure. Consider pre-
op antibiotics. Complex tracks can be laid open and packed individually, or skin fl aps
can be used to cover the defect. Off er hygiene and hair removal advice.
Rectal prolapse The mucosa (partial/type 1), or all layers (complete/type 2—more
common), may protrude through the anus. Incontinence in 75%. It is due to a lax
sphincter, prolonged straining, and related to chronic neurological and psychological
disorders. : Abdominal approach: fi x rectum to sacrum (rectopexy) ± mesh inser-
tion ± rectosigmoidectomy. Laparoscopic rectoplexy is as eff ective as open repair.
Perineal approach: Delorme’s procedure (resect close to dentate line and suture
mucosal boundaries), anal encirclement with a Thiersch wire.
Perianal warts Condylomata acuminata (viral warts) are treated with podophyllo-
toxin or imiquimod or cryotherapy/surgical excision. Giant condylomata acuminata
of Buschke & Loewenstein may evolve into verrucous cancers (low-grade, non-me-
tastasizing). Condylomata lata secondary to syphilis is treated with penicillin.
Proctalgia fugax Idiopathic, intense, brief, stabbing/crampy rectal pain, often
worse at night. The mainstay of treatment is reassurance. Inhaled salbutamol or
topical GTN (0.2–0.4%) or topical diltiazem (2%) may help.
Anal ulcers Consider Crohn’s, anal cancer, lymphogranuloma venerum, TB, syphilis.
Skin tags Seldom cause trouble but are easily excised.

Anal cancer
Incidence: 1233 new cases of anal cancer in the UK (2013). Risk factors: Anorec eptive
intercourse; HPV (HPV 16 associated with worse prognosis); HIV. Histology: Squamous
cell (85%); rarely basaloid, melanoma, or adenocarcinoma. Anal margin tumours
are usually well-diff erentiated, keratinizing lesions with a good prognosis. Anal ca-
nal tumours arise above dentate line, are poorly diff erentiated and non-keratinizing
with a poorer prognosis. Spread: Tumours above the dentate line spread to pelvic
lymph nodes; those below spread to the inguinal nodes. Presentation: Bleeding,
pain, bowel habit change, pruritus ani, masses, stricture. : Perianal warts; leu-
coplakia; lichen sclerosis; Bowen’s disease; Crohn’s disease. Treatment: Chemo-
irradiation (radiotherapy+ fl uorouracil + mitomycin/cisplatin) is usually prefer red
to anor ectal excision & colostomy; 75% retain normal anal function.
Fig 13.43 Anatomy of the anal canal. Perianal abscesses present as
tender, infl amed, localized swellings at the anal verge. Ischiorectal
abscess es are also tender but cause a diff use, indurated swelling in
the ischioanal fossa area. You will fi nd your patient waiting anx-
iously for you, pac ing about, or on the edge of their chair: avoid-
ing all pressure is imperative. NB: above the dentate line = visceral
nerve innervation (hence no pain sensation); below = somatic inner-
vation (very sensitive to pain).

Haemorrhoids (piles)
Defi nition Haemorrhoids (≈running blood in Greek) are disrupted and dilated anal
cushions. The anus is lined mainly by discontinuous masses of spongy vascular tis-
sue—the anal cushions, which contribute to anal closure. Viewed from the lithotomy
position, the three anal cushions are at 3, 7, and 11 o’clock (where the three major
arteries that feed the vascular plexuses enter the anal canal). They are attached
by smooth muscle and elastic tissue, but are prone to displacement and disrup-
tion, either singly or together. The eff ects of gravity (standing), increased anal tone
(?stress), and the eff ects of straining at stool may make them become both bulky
and loose, and so to protrude to form piles (Latin pila, meaning a ball). They are
vulnerable to trauma (eg from hard stools) and bleed readily from the capillaries
(bright red blood) of the underlying lamina propria. NB: piles are not varicose veins.
As there are no sensory fi bres above the dentate line (squamomucosal junction),
piles are not painful unless they thrombose when they protrude and are gripped by
the anal sphincter, blocking venous return. See fi g 13.44.
Diff erential diagnosis Perianal haematoma; anal fi ssure; abscess; tumour; proctalgia
fugax. Never ascribe rectal bleeding to piles without examination or investigation.
Causes Constipation with prolonged straining is a key factor. In many the bowel
habit may be normal. Congestion from a pelvic tumour, pregnancy, CCF, or portal
hypertension are important in only a minority of cases. Elicit red fl ags in history.
Pathogenesis There is a vicious circle: vascular cushions protrude through a tight
anus, become more congested, and hypertrophy to protrude again more readily.
These protrusions may then strangulate. See table 13.15 for classifi cation.
Symptoms Bright red rectal bleeding, often coating stools, on the tissue, or drip-
ping into the pan after defecation. There may be mucous discharge and pruritus ani.
Severe anaemia may occur. Symptoms such as weight loss, tenesmus, and change in
bowel habit should prompt thoughts of other pathology. In all rectal bleeding do:
• An abdominal examination to rule out other diseases.
• PR exam: prolapsing piles are obvious. Internal haemorrhoids are not palpable.
• Colonoscopy/fl exible sigmoidoscopy to exclude proximal pathology if 50 years old.
Treatment 1 Medical: (1st-degree.) Fluid and fibre is key ± topical analgesics &
stool softener (bulk forming). Topical steroids for short periods only.
2 Non-operative: (2nd & 3rd degree, or 1st degree if medical therapy failed.) •Rubber
band ligation. Cheap, but needs skill. Banding produces an ulcer to anchor the mu-
cosa (SE: bleeding, infection; pain). It has the lowest recurrence rate. •Sclerosants.
(1st- or 2nd-degree.) 2mL of 5% phenol in oil is injected into the pile above the den-
tate line, inducing fi brotic reaction. Recurrence higher (SE: impotence; prostatitis).
•Infra-red coagulation. Applied to localized areas of piles, it works by coagulating
vessels and tethering mucosa to subcutaneous tissue. It is as successful as banding
and may be less painful. •Bipolar diathermy and direct current electrotherapy.
Causes coagulation and fi brosis after local application of heat. Success rates are simi-
lar to those of infrared coagulation, and complication rates are low.
3 Surgery: •Excisional haemor rhoid ectomy is the most eff ective treatment (excision
of piles ± ligation of vascular pedicles, as day-case surgery, needing ~2wks off work).
Scalpel, electrocautery, or laser may be used. •Stapled haemorrhoidopexy (procedure
for prolapsing haemorrhoids) may result in less pain, a shorter hospital stay, and quick-
er return to normal activity than conventional surgery. It is used when there is a large
internal component, but has a higher recurrence and prolapse rate than excisional.
Surgical complications include constipation; infection; stricture; bleeding.
Prolapsed, thrombosed piles Analgesia, ice packs, and stool softeners. Pain usu-
ally resolves in 2–3wks. Some advocate early surgery.

Gallstones
Bile contains cholesterol, bile pigments (from broken down Hb), and phospholipids.
If the concentrations vary, diff erent stones may form. Pigment stones: Small, fri-
able, and irregular. Causes: haemolysis. Cholesterol stones: Large, often solitary.
Causes: , age, obesity (Admirand’s triangle: risk of stone if lecithin, bile salts,
cholesterol). Mixed stones: Faceted (calcium salts, pigment, and cholesterol). Gall-
stone prevalence: 8% of those over 40yrs. 90% remain asymptomatic. Risk factors
for stones becoming symptomatic: smoking; parity.
Biliary colic Gallstones are symptomatic with cystic duct obstruction or if passed
into the common bile duct (CBD10). RUQ pain (radiates  back) ± jaundice. : Analgesia
(see p636), rehydrate, NBM. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see BOX ‘Early or
delayed cholecystectomy?’). Do urinalysis, CXR, and ECG.
Acute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallblad-
der (GB10), which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right
shoulder—see p609), vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a GB mass. The main dif-
ference from biliary colic is the infl ammatory component (local peritonism, fever,
WCC; see table 13.16). If the stone moves to the CBD, obstructive jaundice and cholan-
gitis may occur—see BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’. Murphy’s sign: lay 2 fi ngers
over the RUQ; ask patient to breathe in. This causes pain & arrest of inspiration as
an infl amed GB impinges on your fi ngers. It is only +ve if the same test in the LUQ
does not cause pain. A phlegmon (RUQ mass of infl amed adherent omentum and
bowel) may be palpable. Tests: WCC, US—a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in
chronic disease), peri cholecystic fl uid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only
shows ~10% of gallstones; it may identify a ‘porcelain’ GB (associated risk of cancer).
Treatment: NBM, pain relief, IVI, and antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg/8h IV. Lapa-
roscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients fi t for GA. Open
surgery is required if there is GB perforation. If elderly or high risk/unsuita ble for
surgery,consi der percutaneous cholecystostomy; cholecystectomy can still be done
later. Cholecystostomy is also the preferred treatment for acalculous cholecystitis.
Chronic cholecystitis Chronic infl ammation ± colic. ‘Flatulent dyspepsia’: vague
abdom inal discomfort, distension, nausea, fl atulence, and fat intolerance (fat stimu-
lates cholecystokinin release and GB contraction). US to image stones and assess CBD
diameter. MRCP (p742) is used to fi nd CBD stones. : Cholec ystectomy. If US shows a di-
lated CBD with stones, ERCP (p742) + sphincterotomy before surgery. If symptoms per-
sist post-surgery consider hiatus hernia/IBS/peptic ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour.
Other presentations
• Obstructive jaundice with CBD stones: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with
sphincterotomy ± biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open sur-
gery with CBD exploration. If CBD stones are suspected pre-operatively, they should
be identifi ed by MRCP (p742).
• Cholangitis: (Bile duct infection.) Causing RUQ pain, jaundice, and rigors (Charcot’s
triad, BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’). Treat with, eg piperacillin/tazobactam
4.5g/8h IV.
• Gallstone ileus: A stone erodes through the GB into the duodenum; it may then
obstruct the terminal ileum. AXR shows: air in CBD (= pneumobilia), small bowel fl uid
levels, and a stone. Duodenal obstruction is rarer (Bouveret’s syndrome).
• Pancreatitis: See p636.
• Mucocoele/empyema: Obstructed GB fi lls with mucus (secreted by GB wall)/pus.
• Silent stones: Do elective surgery on those with sickle cell, immunosuppression,
(debatably diabetes) as well as all calcifi ed/porcelain GBS.
• Mirizzi’s syndrome: A stone in the GB presses on the bile duct causing jaundice.
• Gallbladder necrosis: Rare because of dual blood supply (hepatic artery via cystic
artery, and from small branches of the hepatic artery in the GB fossa).
• Other: Causes of cholecystitis and biliary symptoms other than gallstones are rare.
Consider infection (typhoid, cryptosporidiosis, and brucellosis); cholecystokinin
release; parenteral nutrition; anatomical abnormality; polyarteritis nodosa (p556).
10 Common abbreviations used in this section: CBD, common bile duct; GB, gallbladder.

Early or delayed cholecystectomy?
For acute cholecystitis Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis
has traditionally been performed 6–12wks after the acute episode due to antici-
pated increased mortality and conversion to open procedure. Early laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, within 7d of symptom onset, is now the treatment of choice.
Early surgery reduces the duration of hospital admission compared with delayed
surgery, but does not reduce mortality or complications. Up to one-quarter of
people scheduled for delayed surgery may require urgent operations because of
recurrent or worsening symptoms.10
For biliary colic Patients with biliary colic due to gallstones waiting for an elec-
tive laparoscopic cholecystectomy may develop signifi cant complications, such
as acute pancreatitis (p636) during the waiting period. One high-bias trial found
early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24h of an acute episode) decreased
potential complications that may develop during the wait for elective surgery.

Acute pancreatitis
This unpredictable disease (mortality ~12%) is characterized by self-perpetuating
pancreatic enzyme-mediated autodigestion; oedema and fl uid shifts cause hypovol-
aemia, as extracellular fl uid is trapped in the gut, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum
(worsened by vomiting). Although pancreatitis is mild in 80% of cases; 20% develop
severe complicated and life-threatening disease: progression may be rapid from mild
oedema to necrotizing pancreatitis. ~50% of cases that advance to necrosis are fur-
ther complicated by infection.
Causes The one mnemonic we can all agree on: ‘GET SMASHED‘. Gallstones (~35%),
Ethanol (~35%), Trauma (~1.5%), Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune (PAN), Scorpion
venom, Hyperlipidaemia, hypothermia, hypercalcaemia, ERCP (~5%) and emboli,
Drugs. Also pregnancy and neoplasia or no cause found (~10–30%).
Symptoms Gradual or sudden severe epigastric or central abdominal pain (radiates
to back, sitting forward may relieve); vomiting prominent.
Signs May be subtle in serious disease. HR, fever, jaundice, shock, ileus, rigid abdo-
men ± local/general tenderness, periumbilical bruising (Cullen’s sign) or fl anks (Grey
Turner’s sign) from blood vessel autodigestion and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.
Tests Raised serum amylase (>1000U/mL or around 3-fold upper limit of normal). The
degree of elevation is not related to severity of disease. Amylase may be normal
even in severe pancreatitis (levels starts to fall within 24–48h). It is excreted renally
so renal failure will  levels. Cholecystitis, mesenteric infarction, and GI perforation
can cause lesser rises. Serum lipase is more sensitive and specifi c for pancreati tis
(especially when related to alcohol), and rises earlier and falls later. ABG to monitor
oxy genation and acid–base status. AXR: No psoas shadow (retroperitoneal fl uid),
‘sentinel loop’ of proximal jejunum from ileus (solitary air-fi lled dilatation). Erect CXR
helps exclude other causes (eg perforation). CT is the standard choice of imaging to
assess severity and for complications. US (if gallstones + AST). ERCP if LFTS worsen. CRP
>150mg/L at 36h after admission is a predictor of severe pancreatitis.
Management Severity assessment is essential (see BOX and table 13.17).
• Nil by mouth, consider NJ feeding (decrease pancreatic stimulation). Set up IVI
and give lots of crystalloid, to counter third-space sequestration, unt il vital signs
are satisfactory and urine fl ow stays at >30mL/h. Insert a urinary catheter and
consider CVP monitoring.
• Analgesia: pethidine 75–100mg/4h IM, or morphine (may cause Oddi’s sphincter
to contract more, but it is a better analgesic and not contraindicated).
• Hourly pulse, BP, and urine output; daily FBC, U&E, Ca2+, glucose, amylase, ABG.
• If worsening: ITU, O2 if PaO2. In suspected abscess formation or pancreatic ne-
crosis (on CT), consider parenteral nutrition ± laparotomy & debridement (‘necro-
sectomy’). Antibiotics may help in severe disease.
• ERCP + gallstone removal may be needed if there is progressive jaundice.
• Repeat imaging (usually CT) is performed in order to monitor progress.
 Any acute abdomen (p606), myocardial infarct.
Early complications Shock, ARDS (p186), renal failure (give lots of fl uid!), DIC, sep-
sis, Ca2+, glucose (transient; 5% need insulin).
Late complications (>1wk.) Pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst(fl uid in lesser
sac, fi g 13.45), with fever, a mass ± persistent amylase/LFT; may resolve or need
drainage. Abscesses need draining. Bleeding from elastase eroding a major ves-
sel (eg splenic artery); embolization may be life-saving. Thrombosis may occur in
the splenic/gastrod uodenal arteries, or colic branches of the SMA, causing bowel
necrosis. Fistulae normally close spontaneously. If purely pancreatic they do not
irritate the skin. Some patients suff er recurrent oedematous pancreatitis so often
that near-total pancreate ctomy is contemplated. It can all be a miserable course.

These criteria have been validated for pancreatitis caused by gallstones and
alcohol; Ranson’s criteria are valid for alcohol-induced pancreatitis, and can only
be fully applied after 48h, which does have its disadvantages. Other criteria for
assessing severity include the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Examination
(APACHE)-II, and the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP).

rather a collection of fl uid in the lesser sac (ie not lined by epi/endothelium).
It develops at ≥6wks. The cyst fl uid is of low attenuation compared with the
stomach contents because it has not been enhanced by the contrast media.

phosphate; 15%). •Also: urate (5%), hydroxyapatite (5%), brushite, cystine (1%), mixed.
Presentation Asymptomatic or: 1 Pain: Excruciating spasms of renal colic ‘loin to
groin’ (or genitals/inner thigh), with nausea/vomiting. Often cannot lie still (diff erenti-
ates from perit onitis). Obstruction of kidney: felt in the loin,between rib 12 and lateral
edge of lumbar muscles(like intercostal nerve irritation pain; the latter is not colicky,
and is worsened by specifi c movements/pressure on a trigger spot). Obstruction of
mid-ureter: may mimic appendicitis/diverticulitis. Obstruction of lower ureter: may
lead to symptoms of bladder irritability and pain in scrotum, penile tip, or labia ma-
jora. Obstruction in bladder or urethra: causes pelvic pain, dysuria, strangury (desire
but inability to void) ± interrupted fl ow. 2 Infection: Can coexist (risk if voiding im-
paired), eg UTI; pyelo nephritis (fever, rigors, loin pain, nausea, vomiting); pyonephrosis
(infected hydronephrosis) 3 Haematuria. 4 Proteinuria. 5 Sterile pyuria. 6 Anuria.
Examination Usually no tenderness on palpation. May be renal angle tenderness
especially to percussion if there is retroperitoneal infl ammation.
Tests FBC, U&E, Ca2+, PO43Ω, glucose, bicarbonate, urate. Urine dipstick: Usually +ve for
blood (90%). MSU: MC&S. Further tests for cause: Urine pH; 24h urine for: calcium, ox-
alate, urate, citrate, sodium, creatinine; stone biochemistry (sieve urine & send stone).
Imaging: Non-contrast CT is investigation of choice for imaging stones (99% visible)
& helps exclude diff erential causes of an acute abdomen. A ruptured abdominal
aortic aneurysm may present similarly. 80% of stones are visible on KUB XR (kidneys +
ureters + bladder). Look along ureters for calcifi cation over the transverse processes
of the vertebral bodies. US an alternative for hydronephrosis or hydroureter.
 Initially: Analgesia, eg diclofenac 75mg IV/IM, or 100mg PR. (If CI: opioids) + IV fl uids
if unable to tolerate PO; antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV, or gen-
tamicin) if infection. Stones <5mm in lower ureter: ~90–95% pass spontaneously.
Fluid intake. Stones >5mm/pain not resolving: Medical expulsive therapy: start
at presentation; nifedipine 10mg/8h PO or -blockers (tams ulosin 0.4mg/d) promote
expulsion and reduce analgesia requirements. Most pass within 48h (>80% after
~30d). If not, try extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) (if <1cm), or ureteros-
copy using a basket. ESWL: US waves shatter stone. SE: renal injury, may also cause BP
and DM. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): keyhole surgery to remove stones,
when large, multiple, or complex. Open surgery is rare.
Indications for urgent intervention (delay kills glomeruli): Presence of infec-
tion and obstruction—a percutaneous nephr ostomy or ureteric stent may be needed
to relieve obstruction (p640); urosepsis; intractable pain or vomiting; impending AKI;
obstruction in a solitary kidney; bilateral obstructing stones.
Prevention General: Drink plenty. Normal dietary Ca2+ intake (low Ca2+ diets in-
crease oxalate excretion). Specifi cally: •Calcium stones: in hypercalciuria, a thiazide
diuretic is used to Ca2+ excretion. •Oxalate: oxalate intake; pyridoxine may be used
(p295). •Struvite (phosphate mineral): treat infection promptly. •Urate: allopurinol
(100–300mg/24h PO). Urine alkalinization may also help, as urate is more soluble at
pH>6 (eg with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate). •Cystine: vigorous hydra-
tion to keep urine output >3L/d and urinary alkalinization (as above-mentioned).
Penicillamine is used to chelate cystine, given with pyridoxine to prevent vitamin
B6 defi ciency.

Questions to address when confronted by a stone
What is its composition? (See table 13.18.)
Table 13.18 Types, causes, and X-ray appearance of renal stones
Type Causative factors Appearance on X-ray
Calcium oxalate (fi g 13.46) Metabolic or idiopathic Spiky, radio-opaque
Calcium phosphate Metabolic or idiopathic Smooth, may be large, radio-
opaque
Magnesium ammonium UTI (proteus causes al- Large, horny, ‘staghorn’, radio-
phosphate (fi g 13.47) kaline urine and calcium opaque
precipitation and ammo-
nium salt formation)
Urate (p680) Hyperuricaemia Smooth, brown, radiolucent
Cystine (fi g 13.48) Renal tubular defect Yellow, crystalline, semi-opaque
Why has he or she got this stone now?
• Diet: chocolate, tea, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, and spinach all oxalate levels.
• Season: variations in calcium and oxalate levels are thought to be mediated by
vitamin D synthesis via sunlight on skin.
• Work: can he/she drink freely at work? Is there dehydration?
• Medications: precipitating drugs include: diuretics, antacids, acetazolamide,
corticosteroids, theophylline, aspirin, allopurinol, vitamin C and D, indinavir.
Are there any predisposing factors? For example:
• Recurrent UTIS (in magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi).
• Metabolic abnormalities:
• Hypercalciuria/hypercalcaemia (p676): hyperparathyroidism, neoplasia,
sarc oido sis, hyperthyroidism, Addison’s, Cushing’s, lithium, vitamin D excess.
• Hyperuricosuria/plasma urate: on its own, or with gout.
• Hyperoxaluria.
• Cystinuria (p321).
• Renal tubular acidosis (pp316–7).
• Urinary tract abnormalities: eg pelviureteric junction obstruction, hydro-
nephrosis (renal pelvis or calyces), calyceal diverticulum, horseshoe kidney,
ureterocele, vesicoureteric refl ux, ureteral stricture, medullary sponge kidney.11
• Foreign bodies: eg stents, catheters.
Is there a family history? Risk of stones 3-fold. Specifi c diseases include X-linked
nephrolithiasis and Dent’s disease (proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis).
Is there infection above the stone? Eg fever, loin tender, pyuria? This needs
urgent intervention.

11 Medullary sponge kidney is a typically asymptomatic developmental anomaly of the kidney mostly seen
in adult females, where there is dilatation of the collecting ducts, which if severe leads to a sponge-like
appearance of the renal medulla. Complications/associations: UTIs, nephrolithiasis, haematuria and hyper-
calciuria, hyperparathyroidism (if present, look for genetic markers of MEN type 2A, see p223).

Urinary tract obstruction
Urinary tract obstruction is common and should be considered in any patient with
impaired renal function. Damage can be permanent if the obstruction is not
treated promptly. Obstruction may occur anywhere from the renal calyces to the
urethral meatus, and may be partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Obstruct-
ing lesions are luminal (stones, blood clot, sloughed papilla, tumour: renal, ureteric,
or bladder), mural (eg congenital or acquired stricture, neuromuscular dysfunction,
schistosomiasis), or extra-mural (abdom inal or pelvic mass/tumour, retroperitoneal
fi brosis, or iatrogenic—eg post surgery). Unilateral obstruction may be clinically
silent (normal urine output and U&E) if the other kidney is functioning. Bilateral
obstruction or obstruction with infection requires urgent treatment. See p641.
Clinical features
• Acute upper tract obstruction: Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be
superimposed infection ± loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney.
• Chronic upper tract obstruction: Flank pain, renal failure, superimposed infection.
Polyuria may occur due to impaired urinary concentration.
• Acute lower tract obstruction: Acute urinary retention typically presents with
severe suprapubic pain ± acute confusion (elderly); often acute on chronic (hence
preceded by chronic symptoms , see next bullet point). Clinically: distended, palpable
bladder containing ~600mL, dull to percussion. Causes include prostatic obstruction
(usual cause in older ), urethral strictures, anticholinergics, blood clots eg from
bladder lesion (‘clot retention’), alcohol, constipation, post-op (pain/infl ammation/
anaesthetics), infection (p296), neurological (cauda equina syndrome, see p466).
• Chronic lower tract obstruction: Symptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, poor
stream, terminal dribbling, overfl ow incontinence. Signs: distended, palpable blad-
der (capacity may be >1.5L) ± large prostate on PR. Complications: UTI, urinary
retention, renal failure (eg bilateral obstructive uropathy—see BOX ‘Obstructive
uropathy’). Causes include prostatic enlargement (common); pelvic malignancy;
rectal surgery; DM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2–S4).
Tests Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA, p530).12 Urine:
Dipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p744) is the imaging modality of choice for investi-
gating upper tract obstruction: If there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter (distension
of the renal pelvis and calyces or ureter), arrange a CT scan. This will determine the
level of obstuction. NB: in ~5% of cases of obstruction, no distension is seen on US.
Radionuclide imaging enables functional assessment of the kidneys.
Treatment Upper tract obstruction: Nephrostomy or ureteric stent. NB: stents may
cause signifi cant discomfort and patients should be warned of this and other risks
(see BOX ‘Problems of ureteric stenting’). -blockers help reduce stent-related pain
(ureteric spasm). Pyeloplasty, to widen the PUJ, may be performed for idiopathic
PUJ obstruction.
Lower tract obstruction: Insert a urethral or suprapubic catheter (p762) to relieve
acute retention. In chronic obstruction only catheterize patient if there is pain, uri-
nary infection, or renal impairment; intermittent self-catheterization is sometimes
required (p763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and
bladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diure-
sis (see BOX ‘Obstructive uropathy’). Monitor weight, fl uid balance, and U&E closely.
Treat the underlying cause if possible, eg if prostatic obstruction, start an -blocker
(see p642). After 2–3 days, trial without catheter (TWOC, p763) may work (especially
if <75yrs old and <1L drained or retention was triggered by a passing event, eg GA).
12 Do venepuncture for PSA before PR, as PR can  total PSA by ~1ng/mL (free PSA  by 10%). It’s diffi cult
to know if acute retention raises PSA, but relieving obstruction does cause it to drop.

Problems of ureteric stenting (depend on site)
Common: Rare:
• Stent-related pain • Obstruction
• Trigonal irritation • Kinking
• Haematuria • Ureteric rupture
• Fever • Stent misplacement
• Infection • Stent migration (especially if made of silicone)
• Tissue infl ammation • Tissue hyperplasia
• Encrustation • Forgotton stents.
• Biofi lm formation.
Obstructive uropathy
In chronic urinary retention, an episode of acute retention may go unnoticed
for days and, because of their background symptoms, may only present when
overfl ow incontinence becomes a nuisance—pain is not necessarily a feature.
After diagnosing acute on chr onic
retent ion and placing a catheter, the
bladder residual can be as much as
1.5L of urine. Don’t be surprised to
be called by the biochemistry lab to
be told that the serum creatinine is
1000μmol/L! The good news is that
renal fun ction usually returns to
baseline after a few days (there may
be mild background impairment).
Ask for an urgent renal US (fi g 13.49) Fig 13.49 Ultrasound of an obstr ucted kidney
and con sider the following in the show ing hydro nephrosis. Note dilatation of renal
acute plan to ensure a safe course: pelvis and ureter, and clubbed calyces.
• Hyperkalaemia See p301. Image courtesy of Norwich Radiology Department.
• Metabolic acidosis On ABG there
is likely to be a respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis. Concerns should
prompt discussion with a renal specialist (a good idea anyway), in case haemo-
dialysis is required (p306).
• Post-obstructive diuresis In the acute phase after relief of the obstruction, the
kidneys produce a lot of urine—as much as a litre in the fi rst hour. It is vital to
provide resuscitation fl uids and then match input with output. Fluid depletion
rather than overload is the danger here.
• Sodium- and bicarbonate–losing nephropathy As the kidney undergoes diu-
resis, Na+ and bicarbonate are lost in the urine in large quantities. Replace ‘in for
out’ (as mentioned above) with isotonic 1 . 26% sodium bicarbonate solution—this
should be available from ITU. Some advocate using 0.9% saline, though the chlo-
ride load may exacerbate acidosis. Withhold any nephrotoxic drugs.
• Infection Treat infection, bearing in mind that the WCC and CRP may be part of
the stress response. Send a sample of urine for MC&S.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common (24% if aged 40–64; 40% if older).
Pathology: Benign nodular or diff use proliferation of musculofi brous and glandular
layers of the prostate. Inner (transitional) zone enlarges in contrast to peripheral lay-
er expansion seen in prostate carcinoma. Features: Lower urinary tract symptoms
(LUTS) = nocturia, frequency, urgency, post-micturition dribbling, poor stream/fl ow,
hesitancy, overfl ow incontinence, haematuria, bladder stones, UTI. Management:
Assess severity of symptoms and impact on life. PR exam. Tests: MSU; U&E; ultrasound
(large residual volume, hydronephrosis—fi g 13.49), PSA (prior to PR exam; see also BOX
‘Advice to asymptomatic men’, p645), transrectal US ± biopsy. Then consider:
• Lifestyle: Avoid caff eine, alcohol (to urgency/nocturia). Relax when voiding. Void
twice in a row to aid emptying. Control urgency by pract ising distraction methods
(eg breathing exercises). Train the bladder by ‘holding on’ to  time between voiding.
• Drugs are useful in mild disease, and while awaiting surgery. • -blockers are 1st
line (eg tamsulosin 400mcg/d PO; also alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin). Smooth
muscle tone (prostate and bladder). SE: drowsiness; depression; dizziness; BP;
dry mouth; ejaculatory failure; extra-pyramidal signs; nasal congestion; weight.
• 5-reductase inhibitors: can be added, or used alone, eg fi nasteride 5mg/d PO
(conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone).
Excreted in semen, so use condoms; females should avoid handling. SE: impotence;
libido. prostate size over 3–6mths and  long-term retention risk.
• Surgery:
• Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) ≤14% become impotent (see BOX).
Crossmatch 2U. Beware bleeding, clot retention, and post TURP syndrome: absorp-
tion of washout causing CNS & CVS disturbance. ~12% need redoing within 8yrs.
• Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) involves less destruction than
TURP, and less risk to sexual function, gives similar benefi t. Relieves pressure
on the urethra. Maybe best surgical option for those with small glands <30g.
• Retropubic prostatectomy is an open operation (if prostate very large).
• Transurethral laser-induced prostatectomy (TULIP) may be as good as TURP.
• Robotic prostatectomy is gaining popularity as a less traumatic and minimally
invasive treatment option.
Advice for patients concerning transurethral prostatectomy (TURP)
Pre-op consent issues may centre on risks of the procedure, eg:
• Haematuria/haemorrhage • Infection; prostatitis
• Haematospermia • Erectile dysfunction ~10%
• Hypothermia • Incontinence ≤10%
• Urethral trauma/stricture • Clot retention near strictures
• Post TURP syndrome (T°; Na+) • Retrograde ejaculation (common).
Post–operative advice
• Avoid driving for 2wks after the operation.
• Avoid sex for 2wks after surgery. Then get back to normal. The amount ejacu-
lated may be reduced (as it fl ows backwards into the bladder—harmless, but
may cloud the urine). It means you may be infertile. Erections may be a problem
after TURP, but do not expect this: in some men, erections improve. Rarely, orgas-
mic sensations are reduced.
• Expect to pass blood in the urine for the fi rst 2wks. A small amount of blood
colours the urine bright red. Do not be alarmed.
• At fi rst you may need to urinate more frequently than before. Do not be de-
spondent. In 6wks things should be much better—but the operation cannot be
guaranteed to work (8% fail, and lasting incontinence is a problem in 6%; 12%
may need repeat TURPS within 8yrs, compared with 1.8% of men undergoing open
prostatectomy).
• If feverish, or if urination hurts, take a sample of urine to your doctor.

Retroperitoneal fi brosis
Causes Idiopathic retroperitoneal fi brosis (RPF), infl ammatory aneurysms of the
abdominal aorta, and perianeurysmal RPF. With idiopathic RPF there is an associ-
ated infl ammatory response resulting in fi brinoid necrosis of the vasa vasorum,
aff ecting the aorta and small and medium retroperitoneal vessels. The ureters get
embedded in dense, fi brous tissue resulting in progressive bilateral ureteric ob-
struction. Secondary causes of RPF include malignancy, typically lymphoma.
Associations Drugs (eg -blockers, bromocriptine, methysergide, methyldopa),
autoimmune disease (eg thyroiditis, SLE, ANCA+ve vasculitis), smoking, asbestos.
Typical patient Middle-aged  with vague loin, back, or abdominal pain, BP.
Tests Blood: Urea and creatinine; ESR; CRP; anaemia. Ultrasound: Dilated ure-
ters (hydronephrosis). CT/MRI: Periaortic mass (fi g 13.50). Biopsy under imaging
guidance is used to rule out malignancy.
Treatment Retrograde stent placement to relieve obstruction (removed after 12
months) ± ureterolysis (dissection of the ureters from the retroperitoneal tissue).
Immunosuppression (in idiopathic RPF) with low-dose steroids has good long-term
results.

Urinary tract malignancies
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises from proximal renal tubular epithelium. Epi-
demiology: Accounts for 90% of renal cancers; mean age 55yrs. :≈2:1. 15% of
haemodialysis patients develop RCC. Features: 50% found incidentally. Haematuria,
loin pain, abdominal mass, anorexia, malaise, weight loss, PUO—often in isolation.
Rarely, invasion of left renal vein compresses left testicular vein causing a varicocele.
Spread may be direct (renal vein), via lymph, or haemat ogenous (bone, liver, lung).
25% have metastases at presentation. Tests: BP: from renin secretion. Blood: FBC
(polycythaemia from erythropoietin secretion); ESR; U&E, ALP (bony mets?). Urine:
RBCS; cytology. Imaging: US (p744); CT/MRI; CXR (‘cannon ball’ metastases). : Radical
nephrectomy (nephron-sparing surgery is as good for T1 tumours + preserves renal
function). Cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation is an option for patients unfi t or
unwilling to undergo surgery. RCC is generally radio- & chemoresistant. In those with
unresectable or metastatic disease, options include: high-dose IL-2 and other T-cell
activation therapies; anti-angiogenesis agents (eg pazopanib, sunitinib, axitinib, or
bevacizumab); mTOR inhibitors, eg temsir olimus. The Mayo prognostic risk score
(SSIGN) was developed to predict survival and uses information on tumour stage,
size, grade, and necrosis. Prognosis: 10yr survival ranges from 96.5% (scores 0–1) to
19.2% (scores ≥ 10).
Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) may arise in the bladder (50%), ureter, or renal
pelvis. Epidemiology: Age >40yrs; :≈4:1. Risk factors: p646. Presentation: Pain-
less haematuria; frequency; urgency; dysuria; urinary tract obstruction. Diagnosis:
Urine cytology; IVU; cystoscopy + biopsy; CT/MRI. : See ‘Bladder tumours’, p646.
Prognosis: Varies with clinical stage/histological grade: 10–80% 5yr survival.
Wilms’ tumour (nephroblastoma) is a childhood tumour of primitive renal tubules
and mesenchymal cells. Prevalence: 1:100 000—the chief abdominal malignancy in
children. It presents with an abdominal mass and haematuria. : OHCS p133.
Prostate cancer The commonest male malignancy. Incidence: with age: 80%
in men >80yrs (autopsy studies). Associations: +ve family history (x2–3 risk, p521),
testost erone. Most are adenocarcinomas arising in peripheral prostate. Spread may
be local (seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum) via lymph, or haemat ogenously (sclerotic
bony lesions). Symptoms: Asymptomatic or nocturia, hesitancy, poor stream, terminal
dribbling, or obstruction. Weight ± bone pain suggests mets. DRE exam of prostate:
may show hard, irregular prostate. Diagnosis: PSA (normal in 30% of small cancers);
transrectal US & biopsy; bone scan; CT/MRI. Staging: MRI. Treatment: Disease confi ned
to prostate: options depend on prognosis (see BOX ‘Prognostic factors’), patient prefer-
ence, and comorbidities. •Radical prostatectomy if <70yrs gives excellent disease-free
survival (laparoscopic surgery is as good). The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy is
being explored. •Radical radiotherapy (± neoadjuvant & adjuvant hormonal therapy) is
an alternative curative option that compares favourably with surgery (no RCTS). It may
be delivered as external beam or brachytherapy. •Hormone therapy alone temporar-
ily delays tumour progression but refractory disease eventually develops. Consider
in elderly, unfi t patients with high-risk disease. •Active surveillance—particularly if
>70yrs and low-risk. Metastatic disease: •Hormonal drugs may give benefi t for 1–2yrs.
LHRH agonists, eg 12-weekly goserelin (10.8mg SC) fi rst stimulate, then inhibit pituitary
gonadotrophin. NB: risks tumour ‘fl are’ when fi rst used—start anti-androgen, eg cypro-
terone acetate, in susceptible patients. The LHRH antagonist degarelix is also used in
advanced disease. Symptomatic : Analgesia; treat hypercalca emia; radiotherapy for
bone mets/spinal cord compression. Prognosis: 10% die in 6 months, 10% live >10yrs.
Screening: DRE of prostate; transrectal US; PSA (see BOX ‘Advice to asymptomatic men’).
Penile cancer Epidemiology: Rare in UK, more common in Far East and Africa, very rare
in circumcised. Related to chronic irritation, viruses, smegma. Presentation: Chronic
fungating ulcer, bloody/purulent discharge, 50% spread to lymph at presentation
: Radiotherapy & irridium wires if early; amputation & lymph node dissection if late.

Advice to asymptomatic men asking for a PSA blood test
• Many men over 50 consider a PSA test to detect prostatic cancer. Is this wise?
• The test is not very accurate, and we cannot say that those having the test will
live longer—even if they turn out to have prostate cancer. Most men with pros-
tate cancer die from an unrelated cause.
• If the test is falsely positive, you may needlessly have more tests, eg prostate
sampling via the back passage (causes bleeding and infection in 1–5% of men).
• Only one in three of those with a high PSA level will have cancer.
• You may be worried needlessly if later tests put you in the clear.
• If a cancer is found, there’s no way to tell for sure if it will impinge on health. You
might end up having a bad eff ect from treatment that wasn’t needed.
• There is much uncertainty on treating those who do turn out to have prostate
cancer: options are radical surgery to remove the prostate (risks erectile dys-
function and incontinence), radiotherapy, or hormones.
• Screening via PSA has shown confl icting results. Some RCTS have shown no dif-
ference in the rate of death from prostate cancer, others have found reduced
mortality, eg 1 death prevented per 1055 men invited for screening (if 37 cancers
detected).
Ultimately, you must decide for yourself what you want.
Prognostic factors in prostate cancer
A number of prognostic factors help determine if ‘watchful waiting’ or agg ressive
therapy should be advised: •Pre-treatment PSA level. •Tumour stage (as measured
by the TNM system; p523). •Tumour grade—Gleason score. Gleason grading is from
1 to 5, with 5 being the highest grade, and carrying the poorest prognosis. Gleason
grades are decided by analysing histology from two separate areas of tumour
specimen, and adding them to get the total Gleason score for the tumour, from 2
to 10. Scores 8–10 suggest an aggressive tumour; 5–7: intermediate; 2–4: indolent.
Benign diseases of the penis
Balanitis Acute infl ammation of the foreskin and glans. Associated with strep
and staph infections. More common in diabetics. Often seen in young children with
tight foreskins : Antibiotics, circumcision, hygiene advice.
Phimosis The foreskin occludes the meatus. In young boys this causes recurrent
balanitis and ballooning, but time (+ trials of gentle retraction) may obviate the
need for circumcision. In adulthood presents with painful intercourse, infection,
ulceration, and is associated with balanitis xerotica obliterans.
Paraphimosis Occurs when a tight foreskin is retracted and becomes irreplace-
able, preventing venous return leading to oedema and even ischaemia of the glans.
Can occur if the foreskin is not replaced after catheterization. : Ask patient
to squeeze glans. Try applying a 50% glucose-soaked swab (oedema may follow
osmotic gradient). Ice packs and lidocaine gel may also help. May require aspira-
tion/dorsal slit/circumcision.
Prostatitis
May be acute or chronic. Usually those >35yrs. Acute prostatitis is caused mostly
by S. faecalis and E. coli, also Chlamydia (and previously TB). Features: UTIs, reten-
tion, pain, haematospermia, swollen/boggy prostate on DRE. : Analgesia; levofl oxa-
cin 500mg/24h PO for 28d. Chronic prostatitis may be bacterial or non-bacterial.
Symptoms as for acute prostatitis, but present for >3 months. Non-bacterial chronic
prostatitis does not respond to antibiotics. Anti-infl ammatory drugs, –blockers,
and prostatic massage all have a place.

Bladder tumours
>90% are transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS) in the UK. Adenocarcin omas and squa-
mous cell carcinomas are rare in the West (the latter may follow schistosomiasis).
UK incidence ≈ 1:6000/yr. :≈5:2. Histology is important for prognosis: Grade 1—
diff erentiated; Grade 2—intermediate; Grade 3—poorly diff ere ntiated. 80% are con-
fi ned to bladder mucosa, and only ~20% penetrate muscle (increasing mortality to
50% at 5yrs).
Presentation Painless haematuria; recurrent UTIs; voiding irritability.
Associations Smoking; aromatic amines (rubber industry); chronic cystitis; schisto-
somiasis (risk of squamous cell carcinoma); pelvic irradiation.
Tests
• Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic.
• Urine: microscopy/cytology (cancers may cause sterile pyuria).
• CT urogram is both diagnostic and provides staging.
• Bimanual EUA helps assess spread.
• MRI or lymphangiography may show involved pelvic nodes.
Staging See table 13.19.
Treating TCC of the bladder
• Tis/Ta/T1: (80% of all patients) Diathermy via transurethral cystoscopy/trans-
urethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Consider a regimen of intravesical
BCG (which stimulates a non-specifi c immune response) for multiple small tumours
or high-grade tumours. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include mitomycin,
epirubicin and gemcitabine. 5yr survival ≈ 95%.
• T2–3: Radical cystectomy is the ‘gold standard’. Radiotherapy gives worse 5yr
survival rates than surgery, but preserves the bladder. ‘Salvage’ cystectomy can
be performed if radiotherapy fails, but yields worse results than primary sur-
gery. Post-op chemotherapy (eg M-VAC: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin,
and cisplatin) is toxic but eff ective. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC or GC
(gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or ra-
diotherapy alone. Methods to preserve the bladder with transurethral resection or
partial cyst ectomy + systemic chemot herapy have been tried, but long-term results
are disappointing. If the bladder neck is not involved, orthotopic reconstru ction
rather than forming a urostoma is an option (both using ~40cm of the patient’s
ileum), but adequate tumour clearance must not be compromised. The patient
should have all these options explained by a urologist and an oncologist.
• T4: Usually palliative chemo/radiotherapy. Chronic catheterization and urinary di-
versions may help to relieve pain.
Follow-up History, examination, and regular cystoscopy: •High-risk tumours: Every
3 months for 2yrs, then every 6 months. •Low-risk tumours: First follow-up cystos-
copy after 9 months, then yearly.
Tumour spread Local  to pelvic structures; lymphatic  to iliac and para-aortic
nodes; haematogenous  to liver and lungs.
Survival This depends on age at surgery. For example, the 3yr survival after cystec-
tomy for T2 and T3 tumours is 60% if 65–75yrs old, falling to 40% if 75–82yrs old (op-
erative mortality is 4%). With unilateral pelvic node involvement, only 6% of patients
survive 5yrs. The 3yr survival with bilateral or para-aortic node involvement is nil.
Complications Cystectomy can result in sexual and urinary malfunction. Massive
bladder haemorrhage may complicate treatment or be a feature of disease treated
palliatively. Determining the cause of bleeding is key. Consider alum solution blad-
der irrigation (if no renal failure) as 1st-line treatment for intractable haematuria in
advanced malignancy: it is an inpatient procedure.

Is asymptomatic non-visible haematuria signifi cant?
Dipstick tests are often done routinely for patients on admission. If non-visible
(previously microscopic) haematuria is found, but the patient has no related
symptoms, what does this mean? Before rushing into a barrage of investigations,
consider:
• One study found that incidence of urogenital disease (eg bladder cancer) was
no higher in those with asymptomatic microhaematuria than in those without.
• Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria is the sole presenting feature in only 4%
of bladder cancers, and there is no evidence that these are less advanced than
malignancies presenting with macroscopic haematuria.
• When monitoring those with treated bladder cancer for recurrence, non-visible-
haematuria tests have a sensitivity of only 31% in those with superfi cial bladder
malignancy, in whom detection would be most useful.
• Although 80% of those with fl ank pain due to a renal stone have microscopic
haematuria, so do 50% of those with fl ank pain but no stone.
The conclusion is not that urine dipstick testing is useless, but that results should
not be interpreted in isolation. Unexplained non-visible haematuria in those
>50yrs should be referred under the 2-week rule. Smokers and those with +ve
family history for urothelial cancer may also be investigated diff erently from
those with no risk factors. It is worth considering, that in a young, fi t athlete, the
diagnosis is more likely to be exercise-induced haematuria. Wise doctors work
collaboratively with their patients. ‘Shall we let sleeping dogs lie?’ is a reasonable
question for some patients.

Urinary incontinence
Think twice before inserting a urinary catheter.
Carry out rectal examination to exclude faecal impaction.
Is the bladder palpable after voiding (retention with overfl ow)?
Is there neurological comorbidity: eg MS; Parkinson’s disease; stroke; spinal trauma?
Incontinence in men Enlargement of the prostate is the major cause of inconti-
nence: urge incontinence (see later in topic) or dribbling may result from partial
retention of urine. TURP (p642) & other pelvic surgery may weaken the bladder sphinc-
ter and cause incontinence. Troublesome incontinence needs specialist assessment.
Incontinence in women Often under-reported with delays before seeking help.
• Functional incontinence: Ie when physiological factors are relatively unimportant.
The patient is ‘caught short’ and too slow in fi nding the toilet because of (for exam-
ple) immobility, or unfamiliar surroundings.
• Stress incontinence: Leakage from an incompetent sphincter, eg when intra-
abdominal pressure rises (eg coughing, laughing). Increasing age and obesity are
risk factors. The key to diagnosis is the loss of small (but often frequent) amounts
of urine when coughing etc. Examine for pelvic fl oor weakness/prolapse/pelvic
masses. Look for cough leak on standing and with full bladder. Stress incontinence
is common in pregnancy and following birth. It occurs to some degree in ~50% of
post-menopausal women. In elderly women, pelvic fl oor weakness, eg with uterine
prolapse or urethrocele (OHCS p290), is a very common association.
• Urge incontinence/overactive bladder syndrome:The urge to urinate is quickly
followed by uncon t rollable and sometimes complete emptying of the bladder as
the detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home
(latchkey incontinence, a conditioned refl ex); cold; the sound of running water; caf-
feine; and obesity.  : urodynamic studies. Cause: detrusor overactivity (see table
13.20), eg from central inhibitory pathway malfunction or sensitization of peripher-
al aff erent terminals in the bladder; or a bladder muscle problem. Check for organic
brain damage (eg stroke; Parkinson’s; dementia). Other causes: urinary infection;
diabetes; diuretics; atrophic vaginitis; urethritis.
In both sexes incontinence may result from confusion or sedation. Occasionally it
may be purposeful (eg preventing admission to an old people’s home) or due to anger.
Management Eff ective treatment can have a huge impact on quality of life.
Check for: UTI; DM; diuretic use; faecal impaction; palpable bladder; GFR.
• Stress incontinence: Pelvic fl oor exercises are 1st line (8 contractions ≈3/d for
3 months). Intravaginal electrical stimulation may also be eff ective, but is not
acceptable to many women. A ring pessary may help uterine prolapse, eg while
awaiting surgical repair. Surgical options (eg tension-free vaginal tape) aim to sta-
bilize the mid-urethra. Urethral bulking also available. Medical options: duloxetine
40mg/12h PO (50% have ≥50%  in incontinence episodes). SE = nausea.
• Urge incontinence: The patient (or carer) should complete an ‘incontinence’ chart
for 3d to defi ne the pattern of incontinence. Examine for spinal cord and CNS signs
(including cognitive test, p64); and for vaginitis (if postmenopausal). Vaginitis can
be treated with topical oestrogen therapy for a limited period. Bladder training
(may include pelvic fl oor exercises) and weight loss are important. Drugs may help
reduce night-time incontinence (see BOX) but can be disappointing. Consider aids,
eg absorbent pad. If  consider a condom catheter.
Do urodynamic assessment (cystometry & urine fl ow rate measurement) before
any surgical intervention to exclude detrusor overactivity or sphincter dyssynergia.

Surgery (eg clam ileocystoplasty) Reserved for troublesome or intractable
symptoms. The bladder is bisected, opened
like a clam, and 25cm of ileum is sewn in.
NB: desmopressin nasal spray 20mcg nocte reduces urine production and  nocturia in overactive bladder.
Unsuitable if elderly (SE: fl uid retention, heart failure, Na+).
*Mind over bladder: •Void when you DON’T have urge; DON’T go to the bathroom when you do have urge.
•Gradually extend the time between voiding. •Schedule your trips to toilet. •Stretch your bladder to normal
capacity. • When urge comes, calm down and make it go using mind over bladder tricks.
Not all male urinary symptoms are prostate-related!
Detrusor overactivity Men get this as well as women. Pressure-fl ow studies
help diagnose this (as does detrusor thickness ≥2.9mm on US).
Primary bladder neck obstruction A condition in which the bladder neck
does not open properly during voiding. Studies in men and women with void-
ing dysfunction show that it is common. The cause may be muscular or neuro-
logical dysfunction or fi brosis. Diagnosis: Video-urodynamics, with simultaneous
pressure-fl ow measurement, and visualization of the bladder neck during voiding.
Treatment: Watchful waiting; -blockers (p642); surgery.
Urethral stricture This may follow trauma or infection (eg gonorrhoea)—and
frequently leads to voiding symptoms, UTI, or retention. Malignancy is a rare cause.
Imaging: Retrograde urethrogram or antegrade cystourethrogram if the patient
has an existing suprapubic catheter. Internal urethrotomy involves incising the
stricture transurethrally using endoscopic equipment—to release scar tissue.
Stents incorporate themselves into the wall of the urethra and keep the lumen
open. They work best for short strictures in the bulbar urethra (anterior urethral
anatomy, from proximal to distal: prostatic urethraposterior or membranous
urethrabulbar urethrapenile or pendulous urethrafossa navicularismeatus).

Lumps in the groin and scrotum
Testicular lump = cancer until proved otherwise.
Acute, tender enlargement of testis = torsion (p652) until proved otherwise.
Diagnosing scrotal masses (fi g 13.51)
1 Can you get above it? 2 Is it separate from the testis? 3 Cystic or solid?
• Cannot get above: inguinoscrotal hernia (p614) or hydrocele extending proximally.
• Separate and cystic: epididymal cyst.
• Separate and solid: epididymitis/varicocele.
• Testicular and cystic: hydrocele.
Testicular and solid—tumour, haem atocele, granuloma (p196), orchitis, gumma
(p412). US may help.
Epididymal cysts Usually develop in adulthood and contain clear or milky (sperm-
atocele) fl uid. They lie above and behind the testis. Remove if symptomatic.
Hydroceles (Fluid within the tunica vaginalis.) Primary (associated with a patent
processus vaginalis, which typically resolves during the 1st year of life) or seconda ry
to testis tumour/trauma/infection. Primary hydro celes are more common, larger,
and usually in younger men. Can resolve spontaneously. : Aspira tion (may need
repeating) or surgery: plicating the tunica vaginalis (Lord’s repair)/inverting the sac
(Jaboulay’s repair). Is the testis normal after aspiration? If any doubt, do US.
Epididymo-orchitis Causes:Chlamydia(eg if<35yrs);E. coli; mumps;N. gonorrh-
oeae; TB. Features: Sudden-onset tender swelling, dysuria, sweats/fever. Take ‘1st
catch’ urine sample; look for urethral discharge. Consider STI screen. Warn of possi-
ble infertility and symptoms worsening before improving. : If <35yrs; doxycycline
100mg/12h (covers chlamydia;treat sexual partn ers). If gonorrhoea suspected add
ceftriaxone 500mg IM stat. If >35yrs (mostly non-STI), associated UTI is common so
try ciprofl oxacin 500mg/12h or ofl oxacin 200mg/12h. Antibiotics should be used for
2–4wks. Also: analgesia, scrotal support, drainage of any abscess.
Varicocele Dilated veins of pampiniform plexus. Left side more commonly aff ect-
ed. Often visible as distended scrotal blood vessels that feel like ‘a bag of worms’.
Patient may complain of dull ache. Associated with subfertility, but repair (via sur-
gery or embolization) seems to have little eff ect on subsequent pregnancy rates.
Haematocele Blood in tunica vaginalis, follows trauma, may need drainage/excision.
Testicular tumours The commonest malignancy in  aged 15–44; 10% occur in
undescended testes, even after orchidopexy. A contralateral tumour is found in
5%. Types: Seminoma, 55% (30–65yrs); non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, 33%
(NSGCT; previously teratoma; 20–30yrs); mixed germ cell tumour, 12%; lymphoma.
Signs: Typically painless testis lump, found after trauma/infection ± haemosperm-
ia, secondary hydrocele, pain, dyspnoea (lung mets), abdominal mass (enlarged
nodes), or eff ects of secreted hormones. 25% of seminomas & 50% of NSGCTS pre-
sent with metastases. Risk factors: Undescended testis; infant hernia; infertility.
Staging: 1 No evidence of metastasis. 2 Infradiaphragmatic node involvement
(spread via the para-aortic nodes not inguinal nodes). 3 Supra diaphragmatic node
involvement. 4 Lung involvement (haematogenous).
Tests: (Allow staging.) CXR, CT, excision biopsy. -FP (eg >3IU/mL)13 and -hCG are
useful tumour markers and help monitor treatment (p531); check before & during .
: Radical orchidectomy (inguinal incision; occlude the spermatic cord before
mobilization to risk of intra-operative spread). Options are constantly updated
(surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). Seminomas are exquisitely radiosensitive.
Stage 1 seminomas: orchidectomy + radiotherapy cures ~95%. Do close follow-
up to detect relapse. Cure of NSGCT, even if metasta ses are present, is achieved
by 3 cycles of bleomycin + etoposide + cisplatin. 5yr survival >90% in all groups.
Encourage regular self-examination (prevents late presentation).
13 FP is not  in pure seminoma; may also be  in: hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, open neural tube defect.

Torsion of the testis
The aim is to recognize this condition before the cardinal signs and symptoms are
fully manifest, as prompt surgery saves testes. If surgery is performed in <6h the
salvage rate is 90–100%; if >24h it is 0–10%.
If in any doubt, surgery is required. If suspected refer immediately to urology.
Symptoms: Sudden onset of pain in one testis, which makes walking uncomfortable.
Pain in the abdomen, nausea, and vomiting are common.
Signs: Infl ammation of one testis—it is very tender, hot, and swollen. The testis
may lie high and transversely. Torsion may occur at any age but is most common at
11–30yrs. With intermittent torsion the pain may have passed on presentation, but if
it was severe, and the lie is horizontal, prophylactic fi xing may be wise.
 : The main one is epididymo-orchitis (p650) but with this the patient tends to
be older, there may be symptoms of urinary infection, and more gradual onset of
pain. Also consider tumour, trauma, and an acute hydrocele. NB: torsion of testicular
or epididymal appendage (the hydatid of Morgagni—a remnant of the Müllerian
duct)—usually occurs between 7–12yrs, and causes less pain. Its tiny blue nodule
may be discernible under the scrotum. It is thought to be due to the surge in gonado-
trophins which signal the onset of puberty. Idiopathic scrotal oedema is a benign
condition usually between ages 2 and 10yrs, and is diff erentiated from torsion by the
absence of pain and tenderness.
Tests: Doppler US may demonstrate lack of blood fl ow to testis. Only perform if
diagnosis equivocal—do not delay surgical exploration.
Treatment: Ask consent for possible orchidectomy + bilateral fi xation (orchi-
dopexy)—see p568. At surgery expose and untwist the testis. If its colour looks good,
return it to the scrotum and fi x both testes to the scrotum.
Undescended testes
Incidence About 3% of boys are born with at least one undescended testis (30%
of premature boys) but this drops to 1% after the fi rst year of life. Unilateral is four
times more common than bilateral. (If bilateral then should have genetic testing.)
• Cryptorchidism: Complete absence of the testis from the scrotum (anorchism is
absence of both testes).
• Retractile testis: The genitalia are normally developed but there is an excessive
cremasteric refl ex. The testis is often found at the external inguinal ring. : reassur-
ance (examining while in a warm bath, for example, may help to distinguish from
maldescended/ectopic testes).
• Maldescended testis: May be found anywhere along the normal path of descent
from abdomen to groin.
• Ectopic testis: Most commonly found in the superior inguinal pouch (anterior to
the external oblique aponeurosis) but may also be abdominal, perineal, penile, and
in the femoral triangle.
Complications of maldescended and ectopic testis Infertility; ≈40 increased risk
of testicular cancer (risk remains after surgery but in cryptorchidism may be  if or-
chidopexy performed before aged 10), increased risk of testicular trauma, increased
risk of testicular torsion. Also associated with hernias (due to patent processus vagi-
nalis in >90%, p613) and other urinary tract anomalies.
Treatment of maldescended and ectopic testis restores (potential for) spermat-
ogenesis; the increased risk of malignancy remains but becomes easier to diagnose.
Surgery: Orchidopexy, usually dartos pouch procedure, is performed in infancy:
testis and cord are mobilized following a groin incision, any processus vaginalis or
hernial sac is removed and the testis is brought through a hole made in the dartos
muscle into the resultant subcutaneous pouch where the muscle prevents retraction.
Hormonal: Hormonal therapy, most commonly human chorionic gonadotrophin
(hCG), is sometimes attempted if an undescended testis is in the inguinal canal.

Aneurysms of arteries
An artery with a dilatation >50% of its original diameter has an aneurysm; remem-
ber this is an ongoing process. True aneurysms are abnor mal dilatations that involve
all layers of the arterial wall. False aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) involve a collec-
tion of blood in the outer layer only (adventitia) whichcommunicates with the lumen
(eg after trauma). Ane ury sms may be fusiform (eg most AAAS) or sac-like (eg Berry
aneurysms; fi g 10.17 p479).
Causes Atheroma, trauma, infection (eg mycotic aneurysm in endocarditis; tertiary
syphilis—especially thoracic aneurysms), connective tissue disorders (eg Marfan’s,
Ehlers–Danlos), infl ammatory (eg Takayasu’s aortitis, p712).
Common sites Aorta (infrarenal most common),iliac,femoral, and popliteal arteries.
Complications Rupture;thrombosis;embolism; fi stulae;pressure on other structures.
Screening All  at age 65yr are invited for screening in UK, decreases mortality
from ruptured AAA.
Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) Death rates/year from ruptured
AAAS rise with age: 125 per million in those aged 55–59; 2728 per million if over 85yrs.
Symptoms & signs: Intermittent or continuous abdominal pain (radiates to back, iliac
fossae, or groins; don’t dismiss this as renal colic), collapse, an expansile abdominal
mass (it expands and contracts, unlike swellings that are purely pulsatile, eg nodes
overlying arteries), and shock. If in doubt, assume a ruptured aneurysm.
Unruptured AAA Defi nition: >3cm across. Prevalence: 3% of those >50yrs.  : 
>3 : 1. Less common in diabetics. Cause: Degeneration of elastic lamellae and smooth
muscle loss. There is a genetic component. Symptoms: Often none, they may cause
abdominal/back pain, often discovered incidentally on abdominal examination (see
BOX). Monitoring: RCTS have failed to demonstrate benefi t from early endovascular
repair (EVAR, see later in paragraph) of aneurysms <5.5cm (where rupture rates are
low). Risk of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms
>6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rup-
ture is more likely if: •BP •Smoker • •Positive family history. Modify risk factors if
possible at diagnosis. Elective surgery: Reserve for aneurysms ≥5.5cm or expanding
at >1cm/yr, or symptomatic aneurysms. Operative mortality: ~5%; complications in-
clude spinal or visceral ischaemia and distal emboli from dislodged thrombus debris.
Studies show that age >80yrs should not, in itself, preclude surgery. Stenting (EVAR):
Major surgery can be avoided by inserting an endovascular stent via the femoral
artery. EVAR has less early mortality but higher graft complications, eg failure of
stent-graft to totally exclude blood fl ow to the aneurysm—‘endoleak’. See fi g 13.52.
Emergency management of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm
Mortality—treated: 41% and improving; untreated: ~100%.
 Summon a vascular surgeon and an experienced anaesthetist; warn theatre.
 Do an ECG, and take blood for amylase, Hb, crossmatch (10–40U may eventually
be needed). Catheterize the bladder.
 Gain IV access with 2 large-bore cannulae. Treat shock with O RhΩve blood (if not
cross matched), but keep systolic BP ≤100mmHg to avoid rupturing a contained
leak (NB: raised BP is common early on).
 Take the patient straight to theatre. Don’t waste time on X-rays: fatal delay may
result, though CT can help in a stable patient with an uncertain diagnosis.
 Give prophylactic antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg IV.
 Surgery involves clamping the aorta above the leak, and inserting a Dacron®
graft (eg ‘tube graft’ or, if signifi cant iliac aneurysm also, a ‘trouser graft’ with
each ‘leg’ attached to an iliac artery).

Thoracic aortic dissection
Blood splits the aortic media with sudden tearing chest pain (± radiation to back).
As the dissection extends, branches of the aorta occlude sequentially leading to
hemiplegia (carotid artery), unequal arm pulses and BP, or acute limb ischaemia,
para plegia (anterior spinal artery), and anuria (renal arteries). Aortic valve incom-
petence, inferior MI, and cardiac arrest may develop if dissection moves proximally.
Type A (70%) dissections involve the ascending aorta, irrespective of site of the tear,
while if the ascending aorta is not involved it is called type B (30%). All patients
with type A thoracic dissection should be considered for surgery: get urgent cardio-
thoracic advice. Defi nitive treatment for type B is less clear and may be managed
medically, with surgery reserved for distal dissections that are leaking, ruptured, or
compromising vital organs. Management: •Crossmatch 10U blood. •ECG & CXR (exp-
anded mediast inum is rare). •CT or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Take
to ITU; hypotensives: keep systolic at ~100–110mmHg: labetalol (p140) or esmolol
(t½ is ultra-short) by IVI is helpful here (calcium-channel blockers may be used if
-blockers contraindicated). Acute operative mortality: <25%.
Fig 13.52 Stenting: not an open or closed
case … this is a digital subtraction angiogram
showing correct positioning of an endovas-
cular stent at the end of the procedure. Al-
though less invasive than open repair, some
are unsuited to this method, owing to the
anatomy of their aneurysm. Lifelong moni-
toring is needed: stents may leak and the an-
eurysm progress (the risk can be reduced by
coiling the internal iliac arteries, as shown).

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
Occurs due to atherosclerosis causing stenosis of arteries (fi g 13.53) via a multi-
factorial process involving modifi able and non-modifi able risk factors. 65% have
coexisting clinically relevant cerebral or coronary artery disease. Cardiovascular
risk factors should be identifi ed and treated aggressively. The chief feature of PAD is
intermittent claudication (= to limp). Prevalence = 10%.
Symptoms Cramping pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock after walking for a given
distance (the claudication distance) and relieved by rest (calf claudication suggests
femoral disease while buttock claudication suggests iliac disease). Ulceration, gan-
grene (p660), and foot pain at rest—eg burning pain at night relieved by hanging legs
over side of bed—are the cardinal features of critical ischaemia. Buttock claudica-
tion ± impotence imply Leriche’s syndrome (p704). Young, heavy smokers are at risk
from Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans, p696).
Fontaine classifi cation for PAD: 1 Asymptomatic. 2 Intermittent claudication. 3 Is-
chaemic rest pain. 4 Ulceration/gangrene (critical ischaemia).
Signs Absent femoral, popliteal, or foot pulses; cold, white leg(s); atrophic skin;
punched out ulcers (often painful); postural/dependent colour change; Buerger’s an-
gle (angle that leg goes pale when raised off the couch) of <20° and capillary fi lling
time >15s are found in severe ischaemia.
Tests Exclude DM, arteritis (ESR/CRP). FBC (anaemia, polycythaemia); U&E (renal dis-
ease); lipids (dyslipidaemia); ECG (cardiac ischaemia). Do thrombophilia screen and
serum homocysteine if <50 years. Ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI): Normal =
1–1.2; PAD = 0.5–0.9; critical limb ischaemia <0.5 or ankle systolic pressure <50mmHg.
Beware falsely high results from incompressible calcifi ed vessels in severe athero-
sclerosis, eg DM.
Imaging Colour duplex US 1st line. If considering intervention MR/CT angiography
(fi g 13.54) for extent and location of stenoses and quality of distal vessels (‘run-off ’).
 1 Risk factor modifi cation: Quit smoking (vital). Treat hypertension and high choles-
terol. Prescribe an antiplatelet agent (unless contraindicated), to prevent progression
and to reduce cardiovascular risk. Clopidogrel is recommended as 1st-line.
2 Management of claudication: •Supervised exercise programmes reduce symp-
toms by improving collateral blood fl ow (2h per wk for 3 months). Encourage patients
to excercise to the point of maximal pain. •Vasoactive drugs, eg naftidrofuryl oxa-
late, off er modest benefi t and are recommended only in those who do not wish to
undergo revascularization and if exercise fails to improve symptoms.
If conservative measures have failed and PAD is severely aff ecting a patient’s life-
style or becoming limb-threatening, intervention is required.
• Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is used for disease limited to a sin-
gle arterial segment (a balloon is infl ated in the narrowed segment). 5-year paten-
cy is 79% (iliac) and 55% (femoral). Stents can be used to maintain artery patency.
• Surgical reconstruction: If atheromatous disease is extensive but distal run-off is
good (ie distal arteries fi lled by collateral vessels), consider arterial reconstruction
with a bypass graft (fi g 13.54). Procedures include femoral–popliteal bypass, femo-
ral–femoral crossover, and aorto–bifemoral bypass grafts. Autologous vein grafts
are superior to prosthetic grafts (eg Dacron® or PTFE) when the knee joint is crossed.
• Amputation <3% of patients with intermittent claudication require major am-
putation within 5 years ( in diabetes, p212). Amputation may relieve intractable
pain and death from sepsis and gangrene. A decision to amputate must be made
by the patient, usually against a background of failed alternative strategies. The
knee should be preserved where possible as it improves mobility and rehabilitation
potential (this must be balanced with the need to ensure wound healing). Rehabili-
tation should be started early with a view to limb fi tting. Gabapentin (regimen on
p504) can be used to treat the gruelling complication of phantom limb pain.
• Future therapies: Early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and
benefi t of gene therapy (eg hepatocyte growth factor) in critical limb ischaemia.

Acute limb ischaemia
Surgical emergency requiring revascularization within 4–6h to save the limb.
May be due to thrombosis in situ (~40%), emboli (38%), graft/angioplasty occlu-
sion (15%), or trauma. Thrombosis more likely in known ‘vasculopaths’; emboli are
sudden, eg in those without previous vessel disease; they can aff ect multiple sites,
and there may be a bruit. Mortality: 22%. Amputation rate: 16%.
• Symptoms and signs: The 6 ‘P’S of acute ischaemia: pale, pulseless, painful,
paralysed, paraesthetic, and ‘perishingly cold’. Onset of fi xed mottling implies
irreversibility. Emboli commonly arise from the heart (AF; mural thrombus) or
aneurysms. In patients with known PAD, sudden deterioration of symptoms
with deep duskiness of the limb may indicate acute arterial occlusion. This ap-
pearance is due to extensive pre–existing collaterals and must not be misdiag-
nosed as gout/cellulitis.
• Management: This is an emergency and may require urgent open surgery or
angioplasty. If diagnosis is in doubt, do urgent arteriography. If the occlusion
is embolic, the options are surgical embolectomy (Fogarty catheter) or local
thrombolysis, eg tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, p345), balancing the risks of
surgery with the haemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis.
• Anticoagulate with heparin after either procedure and look for the source of
emboli. Be aware of possible post-op reperfusion injury and subsequent com-
partment syndrome.

Varicose veins (VVS)
Long, tortuous, & dilated veins of the superfi cial venous system (see fi g 13.55).
Pathology Blood from superfi cial veins of the leg passes into deep veins via perfora-
tor veins (perforate deep fascia) and at the saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal
junctions. Valves prevent blood from passing from deep to superfi cial veins. If they
become incompetent there is venous hypertension and dilata tion of the superfi cial
veins occurs. Risk factors: Prolonged standing, obesity, pregnancy, family history,
and contraceptive pill. Causes: Primary mechanical factors (in ~95%); secondary to
obstruction (eg DVT, fetus, pelvic tumour), arteriovenous malformations, overactive
muscle pumps (eg cyclists); rarely congenital valve absence.
Symptoms ‘My legs are ugly.’ Pain, cramps, tingling, heaviness, and restless legs.
But studies show these symptoms are only slightly commoner in those with VVS.
Signs Oedema; eczema; ulcers; haemosiderin; haemorrhage; phlebitis; atrophie
blanche (white scarring at the site of a previous, healed ulcer); lipodermatosclerosis
(skin hardness from subcutaneous fi brosis caused by chronic infl ammation and fat
necrosis). On their own VVS don’t cause DVTS (except possibly proximally spreading
thrombophlebitis of the long saphe nous vein).
Examination See p78.
Treatment NICE guidelines11 suggest that the criteria for specialist referral of pa-
tients with VVS should be: bleeding, pain, ulceration, superfi cial thrombophlebitis, or
‘a severe impact on quality of life’ (ie not for cosmetic reasons alone).
• Treat any underlying cause.
• Education—avoid prolonged standing and elevate leg(s) whenever possible; sup-
port stockings (compliance is a problem); lose weight; regular walks (calf muscle
action aids venous return).
• Endovascular treatment (less pain and earlier return to activity than surgery.)
• Radiofrequency ablation (VNUS Closure®)—a catheter is inserted into the vein
and heated to 120°C destroying the endothelium and ‘closing’ the vein. Results
are as good as conventional surgery at 3 months.
• Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is similar but uses a laser. Outcomes are
similar to surgical repair after 2yrs (in terms of quality of life and recurrence).
• Injection sclerotherapy—either liquid or foam can be used. Liquid sclerosant
is indicated for varicosities below the knee if there is no gross saphenofemoral
incompetence. It is injected at multiple sites and the vein compressed for a
few weeks to avoid thrombosis (intravascular granulation tissue obliterates
the lumen). Alternatively foam sclerosant is injected under ultrasound guid-
ance at a single site and spreads rapidly throughout the veins, damaging the
endothelium. Ultrasound monitoring prevents inadvertent spread of foam into
the femoral vein. It achieves ~80% complete occlusion but is not more eff ective
than liquid sclerotherapy or surgery.
• Surgery—there are several choices, depending on vein anatomy and surgical
preference, eg saphenofemoral ligation (Trendelenburg procedure); multi-
ple avulsions; stripping from groin to upper calf (stripping to the ankle is not
needed, and may damage the saphenous nerve). Post-op: bandage legs tightly
and elevate for 24h. Surgery is more eff ective than sclerotherapy in the long
term. Before surgery and after venous mapping, ensure that all varicosities
are indelibly marked to either side (to avoid tattooing if the incision is made
through inked skin).
Saphena varix Dilatation in the saphenous vein at its confl uence with the femoral
vein (the SFJ). It transmits a cough impulse and may be mistaken for an inguinal or
femoral hernia, but on closer inspection it may have a bluish tinge.

When do varicose veins become an illness?
Perhaps when they hurt? Or is this too simple? ‘Certain illnesses are desirable:
they provide a compensation for a functional disorder...’ (Albert Camus); this is
known to be common with VVS. Perhaps many opt for surgery as a displacement
activity to confronting deeper problems. We adopt the sickness role when we
want sympathy. Somatization is hard to manage; here is one approach to consider:
• Give time; don’t dismiss these patients as ‘just the “worried well”’.
• Explore factors perpetuating illness behaviour (misinformation, social stressors).
• Agree a plan that makes sense to the patient’s holistic view of themself.
• Treat any underlying depression (drugs and cognitive therapy, OHCS p344).

Gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis
Defi nitions Gangrene is death of tissue from poor vascular supply and is a sign of
critical ischaemia (see p656). Tissues are black and may slough. Dry gangrene is
necrosis in the absence of infection. Note a line of demarcation between living and
dead tissue.14 : restoration of blood supply ± amputation. Wet gangrene is tissue
death and infection (associated with discharge) occurring together (p213, fi g 5.10).
: analgesia; broad-spectrum IV antibiotics; surgical debridement ± amputation. Gas
gangrene is a subset of necrotizing myositis caused by spore-forming clostridial
species. There is rapid onset of myonecrosis, muscle swelling, gas production, sepsis,
and severe pain. Risk factors include diabetes, trauma, and malignancy. : remove
all dead tissue (eg amputation). Give benzylpenicillin ± clindamycin. Hyperbaric O2
can improve survival and  the number of debridements.
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection of the deep fascia causing
necrosis of subcutaneous tissue. Prompt recognition (diffi cult in the early stages) and
aggressive treatment is required. In any atypical cellulitis, get early surgical help.
There is intense pain over aff ected skin and underlying muscle. Group A -haemolytic
streptococci is a major cause, although infection is often polymicrobial. Fournier’s gan-
grene is necrotizing fasciitis localized to the scrotum and perineum. : Radical debride-
ment ± amputation; IV antibiotics, eg benzylpenicillin and clindamycin.
Skin ulcers
Ulcers are abnormal breaks in an epithelial surface. Leg ulcers aff ect ~2% in devel-
oped countries.
Causes May be multiple. For leg ulcers, venous disease accounts for 70%, mixed
arterial and venous disease for 15%, and arterial disease alone for 2%. Other contrib-
utory factors include neuropathy (eg in DM), lymphoedema, vasculitis, malignancy
(p596), infection (eg TB, syphilis), trauma (eg pressure sores: see fi g 10.16, p473), pyo-
derma gangrenosum, drugs (eg nicorandil, hydroxyurea).
History Ask about number, pain, trauma. Explore comorbidities—eg VVS, peripheral
arterial disease, diabetes, vasculitis. Length of history? Is the patient taking steroids?
Are self-induced ulcers, dermatitis artefacta, a possibility? Has a biopsy been taken?
Examination Note features such as site, number, surface area, depth, edge, base, dis-
charge, lymphadeno pathy, sensation, and healing (see BOX). If in the legs, note features
of venous insuffi ciency or arterial disease and, if possible, apply a BP cuff to perform
ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI).
Tests Skin and ulcer biopsy may be necessary—eg to assess for vasculitis (will
need immunohistopathology) or malignant change in an established ulcer (Mar-
jolin’s ulcer = SCC presenting in chronic wound). If ulceration is the fi rst sign of a
suspected systemic disorder then further screening tests will be required.
Management Managing ulcers is often diffi cult and expensive. Treat the cause(s)
and focus on prevention. Optimize nutrition. Are there adverse risk factors (drug
addiction, or risk factors for arteriopathy, eg smoking)? Get expert nursing care.
Consider referral to specialist community nurse or leg ulcer/tissue viability clinic:
• ‘Charing-Cross’ 4-layer compression bandaging is better than standard bandages
(use only if arterial pulses OK: ABPI (p656) should be >0.8). Honey dressings can
improve healing in mild–moderate burns, but as an adjuvant to compression
bandaging for leg ulcers they do not signifi cantly improve healing rate. Negative
pressure wound therapy (eg VAC®) helps heal diabetic ulcers.
• Surgery, larval therapy, and hydrogels are used to debride sloughy necrotic tis-
sue (avoid hydrogels in diabetic ulcers due to risk of wet gangrene).
Routine use of antibiotics does not improve healing. Only use if there is infection
(not colonization).

Features of skin ulceration to note on examination
Site Above the medial malleolus (‘gaiter’ area) is the favourite place for venous
ulcers (fi g 13.56; mostly related to superfi cial venous disease, but may refl ect venous
hypertension via damage to the valves of the deep venous system, eg 2° to DVT).
Venous hypertension leads to the development of superfi cial varicosities and skin
changes (lipodermatosclerosis = induration, pigmentation, and infl ammation of the
skin). Minimal trauma to the leg leads to ulceration which often takes many months
to heal. Ulcers on the sacrum, greater trochanter, or heel suggest pressure sores
(OHCS p604), particularly if the patient is bed-bound with suboptimal nutrition.
Temperature The ulcer and surrounding tissues are cold in an ischaemic ulcer. If
the skin is warm and well perfused then local factors are more likely.
Surface area Draw a map of the area to quantify and time any healing (a wound
>4wks old is a chronic ulcer as distinguished from an acute wound).
Shape Oval, circular (cigarette burns), serpiginous (Klebsiella granulomatis, p412);
unusual morphology can be secondary to mycobacterial infection, eg cutaneous
tuberculosis or scrofuloderma (tuberculosis colliquativa cutis, where an infected
lymph node ulcerates through to the skin).
Edge Shelved/sloping ≈ healing; punched-out ≈ ischaemic or syphilis; rolled/evert-
ed ≈ malignant; undermined ≈ TB.
Base Any muscle, bone, or tendon destruction (malignancy; pressure sores; is-
chaemia)? There may be a grey-yellow slough, beneath which is a pale pink base.
Slough is a mixture of fi brin, cell breakdown products, serous exudate, leucocytes,
and bacteria—it need not imply infection, and can be part of the normal wound
healing process. Granulation tissue is a deep pink gel-like matrix contained within
a fi brous collagen network and is evidence of a healing wound.
Depth If not uncomfortable for the patient (eg in neuropathic ulceration), a probe
can be used to gauge how deep the ulceration extends.
Discharge Culture before starting any antibiotics (which usually don’t work). A
watery discharge is said to favour TB; bleeding can ≈ malignancy.
Associated lymphadenopathy Suggests infection or malignancy.
Sensation Decreased sensation around the ulcer implies neuropathy.
Position in phases of extension/healing Healing is heralded by granulation,
scar formation, and epithelialization. Infl amed margins ≈ extension.

really lucky you can publish your rejections as

On being normal in the society of numbers
Laboratory medicine reduces our patients to a few easy-to-handle numbers: this is
the discipline’s great attraction—and its greatest danger. The normal range (refer-
ence interval) is usually that which includes 95% of a given population (given a nor-
mal distribution, see p750). If variation is randomly distributed, 2.5% of our results
will be ‘too high’, and 2.5% ‘too low’ on an average day, when dealing with apparently
normal people. This statistical defi nition of normality is the simplest. Other defi ni-
tions may be normative—ie stating what an upper or lower limit should be. The
upper end of the reference interval for plasma cholesterol may be given as 6mmol/L
because this is what biochemists state to be the desired maximum. 40% of people
in some populations will have a plasma cholesterol greater than 6mmol/L and thus
may be at increased risk. The WHO defi nition of anaemia in pregnancy is an Hb of
<110g/L, which makes 20% of mothers anaemic. This ‘lax’ criterion has the presumed
benefi t of triggering actions that result in fewer deaths from haemorrhage. So do
not just ask ‘What is the normal range?’—also enquire about who set the range, for
what population, and for what reason.
We thank Dr Petra Sulentic, our Specialist Reader, for her contribution to this chapter.

The essence of laboratory medicine
General principles
• Laboratory testing may contribute to four aspects of medicine:
• diagnosis (eg TSH in hypothyrodism)
• prognosis (eg clotting in liver failure)
• monitoring disease activity or progression (eg creatinine in chronic kidney disease)
• screening (eg phenylketonuria in newborn babies).
• Only do a test if the result will infl uence management. Make sure you look at the
result.
• Always interpret laboratory results in the context of the patient's clinical picture.
• If a result does not fi t with the clinical picture, trust clinical judgement and repeat
the test. Could it be an artefact? The ‘normal’ range for a test (reference interval)
is usually defi ned as the interval, symmetrical about the mean, containing 95% of
results in a given population (p751). The more tests you run, the greater the prob-
ability of an ‘abnormal’ result of no signifi cance (see p751).
• Laboratory staff like to have contact with you. They are an excellent source of help
and information for both requests and results.
• Involve the patient. Don’t forget to explain to them where the test fi ts into their
overall management plan.
Getting the best out of the lab—a laboratory decalogue
1 Interest someone from the laboratory in your patient’s problem.
2 Fill in the request form fully.
3 Give clinical details, not your preferred diagnosis.
4 Ensure that the lab knows who to contact.
5 Label specimens as well as the request form.
6 Follow the hospital labelling routine for crossmatching.
7 Find out when analysers run, especially batched assays.
8 Talk with the lab before requesting an unusual test.
9 Be thoughtful: at1 6:30h the routine results are being sorted.
10 Plot results graphically: abnormalities show sooner.
Artefacts and pitfalls in laboratory tests
• Do not take blood samples from an arm that has IV fl uid running into it.
• Repeat any unexpected and inconsistent result before acting on it.
• For clotting time do not sample from a heparinized IV catheter.
• Serum K+ is overestimated if the sample is old or haemolysed (this occurs if vene-
puncture is diffi cult).
• If using Vacutainers, fi ll plain tubes fi rst—otherwise, anticoagulant contam ination
from previous tubes can cause errors.
• Total calcium results are aff ected by albumin concentration (p676).
• INR may be overestimated if citrate bottles are underfi lled.
• Drugs may cause analytic errors (eg prednisolone cross-reacts with cortisol). Be
suspicious if results are unexpected.
• Food may aff ect result, eg bananas raise urinary HIAA (p271).
Ford Madox Ford 1915 'The Good Soldier'
Normal values can have hidden historical, social, and political desiderata—just like
the normal values novelists ascribe to their characters: ‘Conventions and tradi-
tions I suppose work blindly but surely for the preservation of the normal type;
for the extinction of proud, resolute and unusual individuals… Society must go
on, I suppose, and society can only exist if the normal, if the virtuous, and the
slightly-deceitful fl ourish, and if the passionate, the headstrong, and the too-
truthful are condemned to suicide and to madness. Yes, society must go on; it
must breed, like rabbits. That is what we are here for … But, at any rate, there
is always Leonora to cheer you up; I don’t want to sadden you. Her husband is
quite an economical person of so normal a fi gure that he can get quite a large
proportion of his clothes ready-made. That is the great desideratum of life.’

urea is reabsorbed by the kidney. Creatinine is hardly reabsorbed at all.

Laboratory results: when to take action NOW
• On receiving a dangerous result, fi rst check the name and date.
• Go to the bedside. If the patient is conscious, turn off any IVI (until fl uid is
checked: a mistake may have been made) and ask the patient how he or she is.
Any fi ts, faints, collapses, or unexpected symptoms?
• Be sceptical of an unexpectedly, wildly abnormal result with a well patient. Com-
pare with previous values. Could the specimens have got muddled up; whose is
it? Is there an artefact? Was the sample taken from the ‘drip’ arm? Is a low cal-
cium due to a low albumin (p676)? Perhaps the lab is using a new analyser with a
faulty wash cycle? When in doubt, seek help and repeat the test.
The following values are somewhat arbitrary and must be taken as a guide only.
Many results less extreme than those listed will be just as dangerous if the patient
is old, immunosuppressed, or has some other pathology such as pneumonia.
Plasma biochemistry:
The main risks when plasma electrolytes are dangerously abnormal (table 14.3)
are of cardiac arrhythmias and CNS events such as seizures.
Table 14.3 Dangerous levels of the common serum elecrolytes
Electrolyte Lower limit Upper limit Relevant pages
Na+ <120mmol/L >155mmol/L p672
K+ <2.5mmol/L >6.5mmol/L p674, p301
Corrected Ca2+ <2.0mmol/L >3.5mmol/L p676, p678
Glucose <2.0mmol/L >20mmol/L p832, p834
Blood gases:
• PaO2 <8.0kPa = Severe hypoxia. Give O2. See p188.
• pH <7.1 = Dangerous acidosis. See p670 to determine the cause.
Haematology results:
• Hb <70g/L with low mean cell volume (<75fL) or history of bleeding. This pa-
tient may need urgent transfusion (no spare capacity)—ask about symptoms,
co-morbidities, and baseline Hb. Check haematinics before transfusion. See p324.
• Platelets <40≈109/L. May need a platelet transfusion; call a haematologist.
• Plasmodium falciparum seen on blood fi lm. Start antimalarials now. See p418.
• ESR >30mm/h + headache. Could there be giant cell arteritis? See p556.
CSF results:
 Never delay treatment when bacterial meningitis is suspected.
• >1 neutrophil/mm3. Is there meningitis: usually >1000 neutrophils? See p822.
• Positive Gram stain. Talk to a microbiologist; urgent blind therapy. See p822.
Confl icting, equivocal, or inexplicable results: Get prompt help.

Fluid balance and IV fl uid therapy
Fluid requirement Roughly 2–2.5L in a normal person (~70kg) over 24h. Normal daily
losses are through urine (1500mL), stool (200mL), and insensible losses (800mL). This
requirement is normally met through food (1000mL) and drink (1500mL).
Intravenous fl uids Given if suffi cient fl uids cannot be given orally. About 2–2.5L of
fl uid containing roughly 70mmol Na+ and 70mmol K+ per 24h are required.1 Thus, a
good regimen is 2–2.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20–30mmol of K+
per litre of fl uid. Alternative routes are via a central venous line or subcutaneously.
However, remember that all cannulae carry a risk of MRSA infection: femoral > jugular
> subclavian > peripheral, so always resume oral fl uid intake as soon as possible.
In a sick patient, don’t forget to include additional sources of fl uid loss when calcu-
lating daily fl uid requirements, such as drains, fevers, or diarrhoea (see BOX 'Special
cases'). Daily weighing helps to monitor overall fl uid balance, as will fl uid balance
charts.
Examine patients regularly to assess fl uid balance (see BOX 'Assessing fl uid bal-
ance').
Fluid compartments and types of IV fl uid
For a 70kg man, total bodily fl uid is ~42L (60% body weight). Of this, ⅔ is intracellular
(28L) and ⅓ is extracellular (14L). Of the extracellular compartment, ⅓ is intravascu-
lar, ie blood (5L). Diff erent types of IV fl uid will equilibrate with the diff erent fl uid
compartments depending on the osmotic content of the given fl uid.
5% glucose: (=Dextrose.) Isotonic, but contains only a small amount of glucose
(50g/L) and so provides little energy (~10% daily energy per litre). The liver rapidly
metabolizes all the glucose leaving only water, which rapidly equilibrates throughout
all fl uid compartments. It is, therefore, useless for fl uid resuscitation (only 1/9 will
remain in the intravascular space), but suitable for maintaining hydration. Excess 5%
glucose IV may lead to water overload and hyponatraemia (p672).
0.9% saline: (‘Normal saline.’) Has about the same Na+ content as plasma (150mmol/L)
and is isotonic with plasma. 0.9% saline will equilibrate rapidly throughout the extra-
cellular compartment only, and takes longer to reach the intracellular compartment
than 5% glucose. It is, therefore, appropriate for fl uid resuscitation, as it will remain
predominantly in the extracellular space (and thus ⅓ of the given volume in the
intravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic
saline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only.
Colloids: (eg Gelofusine®.) Have a high osmotic content similar to that of plasma
and therefore remain in the intravascular space for longer than other fl uids, making
them appropriate for fl uid resuscitation, but not for general hydration. Colloids are
expensive, and may cause anaphylactic reactions. In reality, eff ective fl uid resuscita-
tion will use a combination of colloid and 0.9% saline.
Hypertonic glucose (10% or 50%): May be used in the treatment of hypoglycaemia.
It is irritant to veins, so care in its use is needed. Infusion sites should be inspected
regularly, and fl ushed with 0.9% saline after use.
Glucose with sodium chloride: (One-fi fth ‘normal saline.’) Isotonic, containing 0.18%
saline (30mmol/L of Na+) and 4% glucose (222mmol/L). It has roughly the quantity of
Na+ required for normal fl uid maintenance, when given 10-hourly in adults, but is now
most commonly used in a paediatric setting.
Hartmann’s solution: Contains Na+ 131mmol, ClΩ 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K+
5mmol, HCO3Ω 29mmol, and Ca2+ 2mmol per litre of fl uid. It is an alternative to 0.9%
saline, and some consider it more physiological.

Assessing fl uid balance
Underfi lled: Overfi lled:
• Tachycardia • JVP (p43)
• Postural drop in BP (low BP is a late • Pitting oedema of the sacrum, ankles, or
sign of hypovolaemia) even legs and abdomen
• capillary refi ll time • Tachypnoea
• urine output • Bibasal crepitations
• Cool peripheries • Pulmonary oedema on CXR (fi g 16.3, p723).
• Dry mucous membranes See also p134 for signs of heart failure.
• skin turgor
• Sunken eyes.
The JVP is a substitute marker of central venous pressure, and when assessing fl uid
balance is diffi cult, a CVP line may help to guide fl uid management.
Special cases
Acute blood loss: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae
until blood is available.
Children: Use glucose with sodium chloride for fl uid maintenance: 100mL/kg for
the fi rst 10kg, 50mL/kg for the next 10kg, and 20mL/kg thereafter—all per 24h.
Elderly: May be more prone to fl uid overload, so use IV fl uids with care (smaller
fl uid bolus).
GI losses: (Diarrhoea, vomiting, NG tubes, etc.) Replace lost K+ as well as lost fl uid
volume.
Heart failure: Use IV fl uids with care to avoid fl uid overload (p134).
Liver failure: Patients often have a raised total body sodium, so use salt-poor
albumin or blood for resuscitation, and avoid 0.9% saline for maintenance.
Acute pancreatitis: Aggressive fl uid resuscitation is required due to large
amounts of sequestered ‘third-space’ fl uid (p636).
Poor urine output: Aim for >1 mL/kg/h; the minimum is >0. 5mL/kg/h. Give a fl uid
challenge, eg 500mL 0.9% saline over 1h (or half this volume in heart failure or the
elderly), and recheck the urine output. If not catheterized, exclude retention; if
catheterized, ensure the catheter is not blocked!
Post-operative: Check the operation notes for intraoperative losses, and ensure
you chart and replace added losses from drains, etc.
Shock: Resuscitate with colloid or 0.9% saline via large-bore cannulae. Identify
the type of shock (p790).
Transpiration losses: (Fever, burns.) Beware the large amounts of fl uid that can
be lost unseen through transpiration. Severe burns in particular may require ag-
gressive fl uid resuscitation (p846).
Potassium in IV fl uids
• Potassium ions can be given with 5% glucose or 0.9% saline, usually 20mmol/L
or 40mmol/L.
• K+ may be retained in renal failure, so beware giving too much IV.
• Gastrointestinal fl uids are rich in K+, so increased fl uid loss from the gut (eg
diarrhoea, vomiting, high-output stoma, intestinal fi stula) will need increased
K+ replacement.
The maximum concentration of K+ that is safe to infuse via a peripheral line is
40mmol/L, at a maximum rate of 20mmol/h in a cardiac monitored patient. Fluid-
restricted patients may require higher concentrations or rates in life-threatening
hypokalaemia. Faster rates risk cardiac dysrhythmias and asystole, and higher
concentrations thrombophlebitis, depending on the size of the vein, so give con-
centrated solutions >40mmol/L via a central venous catheter, and use ECG moni-
toring for rates >10mmol/h. For symptoms and signs of hyper- and hypokalaemia
see p674.

Electrolyte physiology and the kidney
The kidney Controls the homeostasis of a number of serum electrolytes (includ-
ing Na+, K+, Ca2+, and PO43Ω), helps to maintain acid–base balance, and is responsible
for the excretion of many substances. It also makes erythropoietin and renin, and
hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-di hydroxy vitamin D (see p676 for Ca2+ and
PO43Ω physiology). All of these functions can be aff ected in chronic kidney disease
(p302), but it is the biochemical eff ects of kidney failure that are used to monitor
disease progression.
The renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system Plasma is fi ltered by the glomeruli,
and Na+, K+, H+, and water are reabsorbed from this fi ltrate under the control of the
renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular
apparatus (fi g 7.13, p316) in response to low renal fl ow and raised sympathetic tone,
and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen (a peptide made by the liver) to
angiotensin I. This is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which
is located throughout the vascular tree, to angiotensin II. The latter has several
important actions including eff erent renal arteriolar constriction (thus perfusion
pressure), peripheral vaso constriction, and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to pro-
duce aldosterone, which activates the Na+/K+ pump in the distal renal tubule leading
to reabsorption of Na+ and water from the urine, in exchange for K+ and H+. Glucose
spills over into the urine when the plasma concentration > renal threshold for reab-
sorption (≈10mmol/L, but this varies between people, and is  in pregnancy).
Control of sodium Control is through the action of aldosterone on the distal con-
voluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct to increase Na+ reabsorption from the urine.
The natriuretic peptides ANP, BNP, and CNP (p137) contribute to Na+ homeostasis by
reducing Na+ reabsorption from the DCT and inhibiting renin. A high GFR (see later in
this topic) results in increased Na+ loss, and high renal tubular fl ow and haemodilu-
tion decrease Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule.
Control of potassium Most K+ is intracellular, and thus serum K+ levels are a poor
refl ection of total body potassium. The concentrations of K+ and H+ in extracellular
fl uid tend to vary together. This is because these ions compete with each other in the
exchange with Na+ that occurs across most cell membranes and in the distal con-
voluted tubule of the kidney, where Na+ is reabsorbed from the urine. Thus, if the H+
concentration is high, less K+ will be excreted into the urine. Similarly, K+ will compete
with H+ for exchange across cell membranes and extracellular K+ will accumulate.
Insulin and catecholamines both stimulate K+ uptake into cells by stimulating the
Na+/K+ pump.
Serum osmolality A laboratory measurement of the number of osmoles per kilo-
gram of solvent. It is approximated by serum osmolarity (the number of osmoles
per litre of solution) using the equation 2(Na+ + K+) + Urea + Glucose, since these are
the predominant serum electrolytes. Normal serum osmolarity is 280–300mmol/L,
which will always be a little less than the laboratory-measured osmolality—the
osmolar gap. However, if the osmolar gap is greater than 10mmol/L, this indicates
the presence of additional solutes: consider diabetes mellitus or high blood ethanol,
methanol, mannitol, or ethylene glycol.
Control of water Control is mainly via serum Na+ concentration, since water intake
and loss are regulated to hold the extracellular concentration of Na+ constant. Raised
plasma osmolality (eg dehydration or glucose in diabetes mellitus) causes thirst
through the hypothalamic thirst centre and the release of antidiuretic hormone
(ADH) from the posterior pituitary. ADH increases the passive water reabsorption
from the renal collecting duct by opening water channels to allow water to fl ow
from the hypotonic luminal fl uid into the hypertonic renal interstitium. Low plasma
osmolality inhibits ADH secretion, thus reducing renal water reabsorption.
Glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) Defi ned as the volume of fl uid fi ltered by the glo-
meruli per minute (units mL/min), and is one of the primary measures of disease
progression in chronic kidney disease. It can be estimated in a number of diff erent
ways (see BOX).

Estimating GFR
Calculating GFR is useful because it is a more sensitive indication of the degree
of renal impairment than serum creatinine. Subjects with low muscle mass (eg
the elderly, women) can have a ‘normal’ serum creatinine, despite a signifi cant
reduction in GFR. This can be important when prescribing nephrotoxic drugs, or
drugs that are renally excreted, which may therefore accumulate to toxic levels
in the serum.
A number of methods for estimating GFR exist, all relying on a calculation of
the clearance of a substance that is renally fi ltered and then not reabsorbed in
the renal tubule. For example, the rate of clearance of creatinine can be used as a
marker for the rate of fi ltration of fl uid and solutes in the glomerulus because it is
only slightly reabsorbed from the renal tubule. The more of the fi ltered substance
that is reabsorbed, however, the less accurate the estimate of GFR.
MDRD (Modifi cation of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group): This provides an
estimate of GFR from four simple parameters: serum creatinine, age, gender, and
race (black/non-black). It is one of the best validated for monitoring patients with
established moderately severe renal impairment,2 and most labs now routinely
report estimated GFR (eGFR) using the MDRD equation on all U&E reports:
eGFR = 32 788 ≈ serum creatinineΩ1 . 154 ≈ ageΩ0 . 203 ≈ [1 . 212 if black] ≈ [0 . 742 if female]
However, a number of caveats exist, so that it is best used in monitoring declin-
ing renal function rather than labelling elderly patients with mild renal impairment:
• It is not validated for mild renal impairment, and therefore its use for screening
general populations is questionable.
• Inter-individual variations (and thus confi dence intervals) are wide, although
for each individual variations are small so that a decline in eGFR over a number of
serum samples is always signifi cant.
• Single results may be aff ected by variations in serum creatinine, such as after a
protein-rich meal.
Cockcroft–Gault equation: This provides an estimate of creatinine clearance. It
is an improvement on the MDRD equation because it also takes into account the
patient’s weight. However, 10% of creatinine is actively excreted in the tubules,
and therefore creatinine clearance overestimates true GFR and underestimates
renal impairment. Moreover, the equation assumes ideal body weight and is thus
unreliable in the obese or oedematous. Also unreliable in unstable renal function.
(140 Ω age) ≈ weight (kg) ≈ [0 . 85 if female] ≈ [1 . 212 if black]
Creatinine clearance =
0 . 813 ≈ serum creatinine (μmol/L)
Creatinine clearance can also be calculated by measuring the excreted creatinine
in a 24h urine collection and comparing it with the serum creatinine concentra-
tion. However, the accuracy of collection is vital but often poor, making this an
unreliable and inconvenient method.
GFR can also be measured by injection of a radioisotope followed by sequential
blood sampling (51Cr-EDTA) or by an isotope scan (eg DTPA 99Tc, p190). These meth-
ods allow a more accurate estimate of GFR than creatinine clearance, since smaller
proportions of these substances are reabsorbed in the tubules. They also have the
advantage of being able to provide split renal function.
Inulin clearance: The gold standard for calculating GFR, because 100% of fi ltered
inulin (not insulin) is retained in the luminal fl uid and therefore refl ects exactly the
rate of fi ltration of water and solutes in the glomerulus. However, measuring inulin
clearance again requires urine collection over several hours, and also a constant IV
infusion of inulin, and is therefore inconvenient to perform.

Acid–base balance
Arterial blood pH is closely regulated in health to 7.40 ± 0.05 by various mechanisms
including bicarbonate, other plasma buff ers such as deoxygenated haemoglobin, and
the kidney. Acid–base disorders needlessly confuse many people, but if a few simple
rules are applied, then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. The key principle is
that primary changes in HCO3Ω are metabolic and in CO2 respiratory. See fi g 14.2.
A simple method
1 Look at the pH, is there an acidosis or alkalosis?
• pH <7.35 is an acidosis; pH >7.45 is an alkalosis.
2 Is the CO abnormal? (Normal range 4.7–6.0kPa.)
2
If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?
• CO2 is an acidic gas—is CO2 raised with an acidosis, lowered with an alkalosis?
If so, it is in keeping with the pH and thus caused by a respiratory problem. If
there is no change, or an opposite one, then the change is compensatory.
3 Is the HCOΩ abnormal? (Normal concentration 22–28mmol/L.)
3
If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?
• HCO3Ω is alkaline—is HCO3Ω raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis?
If so, the problem is a metabolic one.
4 Is the PO abnormal? Interpret in the context of the FiO.
a 2 2
An example Your patient’s blood gas shows: pH 7.05, CO2 2.0kPa, HCO3Ω 8.0mmol/L.
There is an acidosis. The CO2 is low, and thus it is a compensatory change. The HCO3Ω
is low and is thus the primary change, ie a metabolic acidosis.
The anion gap Estimates unmeasured plasma anions (‘fi xed’ or organic acids such
as phosphate, ketones, and lactate—hard to measure directly). It is calculated as the
diff erence between plasma cations (Na+ and K+) and anions (ClΩ and HCO3Ω). Normal
range: 10–18mmol/L. It is helpful in determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis.
Metabolic acidosis pH, HCO3Ω
Causes of metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap:
Due to increased production, or reduced excretion, of fi xed/organic acids. HCO3Ω falls
and unmeasured anions associated with the acids accumulate.
• Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia).
• Urate (renal failure).
• Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol).
• Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol).
Causes of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap:
Due to loss of bicarbonate or ingestion of H+ ions (ClΩ is retained).
• Renal tubular acidosis.
• Diarrhoea.
• Drugs (acetazolamide).
• Addison’s disease.
• Pancreatic fi stula.
• Ammonium chloride ingestion.
Metabolic alkalosis pH, HCO3Ω
• Vomiting.
• K+ depletion (diuretics).
• Burns.
• Ingestion of base.
Respiratory acidosis pH, CO2
• Type 2 respiratory failure due to any lung, neuromuscular, or physical cause (p188).
• Most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Look at the PaO2.
It will probably be low. Is oxygen therapy required? Use controlled O2 (Venturi
connector) if COPD is the underlying cause, as too much oxygen may make matters
worse (p189).
 Beware exhaustion in asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema, which can pre-
sent with this picture when close to respiratory arrest. A normal or high PaCO2 is
worrying. These patients require urgent ITU review for ventilatory support.

Respiratory alkalosis pH, CO2
A result of hyperventilation of any cause. CNS causes: Stroke; subarachnoid bleed;
meningitis. Others: Mild/moderate asthma; anxiety; altitude; T°; pregnancy; pulmo-
nary emboli (refl ex hyperventilation); drugs, eg salicylates.
Terminology To aid understanding, we have used the terms acidosis and alkalosis,
where a purist would sometimes have used acidaemia and alkalaemia. Technically
acidaemia is the state of having a low blood pH, whereas acidosis refers to the pro-
cesses which generate H+, leading to the acidaemia.
Fig 14.2 The shaded area represents normality. This method is very power-
ful. The result represented by point ≈, for example, indicates that the acidosis
is in part respiratory and in part metabolic. Seek a cause for each.

Hy pernatraemia
Signs and symptoms Lethargy, thirst, weakness, irritability, confusion, coma, and
fi ts, along with signs of dehydration (p666). Laboratory features: Na+, PCV, alb,
urea.
Causes
Usually due to water loss in excess of Na+ loss:
• Fluid loss without water replacement (eg diarrhoea, vomit, burns).
• Diabetes insipidus (p240). Suspect if large urine volume. This may follow head in-
jury, or CNS surgery, especially pituitary.
• Osmotic diuresis (for diabetic coma, see p832).
• Primary aldosteronism: rarely severe, suspect if BP, K+, alkalosis (HCO3Ω).
• Iatrogenic: incorrect IV fl uid replacement (excessive saline).
Management Give water orally if possible. If not, give glucose 5% IV slowly (1L/6h)
guided by urine output and plasma Na+. Use 0.9% saline IV if hypovolaemic, since
this causes less marked fl uid shifts and is hypotonic in a hypertonic patient. Avoid
hypertonic solutions.
Hy ponatraemia
Plasma Na+ concentration depends on the amount of both Na+ and water in the
plasma. Hyponatraemia therefore does not necessarily imply Na+ depletion. Assess-
ing fl uid status is the key to diagnosis (see fi g 14.3).
Signs and symptoms Look for anorexia, nausea, and malaise initially, followed by
headache, irritability, confusion, weakness, GCS, and seizures, depending on the se-
verity and rate of change in serum Na+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indi-
cate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls in the elderly. 3
Causes See fi g 14.3. Artefactual causes include: •blood sample was from a drip arm
•high serum lipid/protein content causing serum volume, with Na+ concentration
but normal plasma osmolality •if hyperglycaemic (20mmol/L) add ~4.3mmol/L to
plasma Na+ for every 10mmol/L rise in glucose above normal.
Iatrogenic hyponatraemia If 5% glucose is infused continuously without adding
0.9% saline, the glucose is quickly used, rendering the fl uid hypotonic and causing hy-
ponatraemia, esp. in those on thiazide diuretics, women (esp. pre-menopausal), and
those undergoing physiological stress (eg post-operative, septic). In some patients,
only marginally low plasma Na+ levels cause serious eff ects (eg ~128mmol/L)—don’t
attribute odd CNS signs to non-existent strokes/TIAS if Na+.
Management
• Correct the underlying cause; never base treatment on Na+ concentration alone.
The presence of symptoms, the chronicity of the hyponatraemia, and state of hy-
dration are all important. Replace Na+ and water at the same rate they were lost.
• Asymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia, fl uid restriction is often suffi cient if
asymptomatic, although demeclocycline (ADH antagonist) may be required. If hy-
pervolaemic (cirrhosis, CCF), treat the underlying disorder fi rst.
• Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, or if dehydrated, cautious rehydration
with 0.9% saline may be given, but do not correct changes rapidly as central pontine
myelinolysis2 may result. Maximum rise in serum Na+ 15mmol/L per day if chronic,
or 1mmol/L per hour if acute. Consider using furosemide when not hypovolaemic
to avoid fl uid overload.
• Vasopressor receptor antagonists (‘vaptans’, eg tolvaptan) promote water excre-
tion without loss of electrolytes, and appear to be eff ective in treating hypervolae-
mic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia but are expensive. 4
 In emergency: (Seizures, coma) seek expert help. Consider hypertonic saline (eg
1.8% saline) at 70mmol Na+/h ± furosemide. Aim for a gradual increase in plasma
Na+ to ≈125mmol/L. Beware heart failure and central pontine myelinolysis.2
2 Central pontine myelinolysis: irreversible and often fatal pontine demyelination seen in malnourished
alcoholics or rapid correction of Na+. There is subacute onset of lethargy, confusion, pseudobulbar palsy,
para- or quadriparesis, ‘locked-in’ syndrome, or coma.

Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)
An important, but over-diagnosed, cause of hyponatraemia. The diagnosis re-
quires concentrated urine (Na+ > 20mmol/L and osmolality > 100mosmol/kg) in the
presence of hypon atraemia (plasma Na+ < 125mmol/L) and low plasma osmolality
(< 260mosmol/kg), in the absence of hypovolaemia, oedema, or diuretics.
Causes:
• Malignancy: lung small-cell, pancreas, prostate, thymus, or lymphoma.
• CNS disorders: meningoencephalitis, abscess, stroke, subarachnoid or subdural
haemorrhage, head injury, neurosurgery, Guillain–Barré, vasculitis, or SLE.
• Chest disease: TB, pneumonia, abscess, aspergillosis, small-cell lung cancer.
• Endocrine disease: hypothyroidism (not true SIADH, but perhaps due to excess
ADH release from carotid sinus baroreceptors triggered by  cardiac output).
• Drugs: opiates, psychotropics, SSRIs, cytotoxics.
• Other: acute intermittent porphyria, trauma, major abdominal or thoracic sur-
gery, symptomatic HIV.
Treatment: Treat the cause and restrict fl uid. Consider salt ± loop diuretic if severe.
Demeclocycline is used rarely. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (‘vaptans’, p672)
are an emerging class of drug used in SIADH and other types of hyponatraemia.

Hyperkalaemia
A plasma potassium >6.5mmol/L is a potential emergency and needs urgent as-
sessment (see p301). The worry is of myocardial hyperexcitability leading to ven-
tricular fi brillation and cardiac arrest. First assess the patient—do they look unwell,
is there an obvious cause? If not, could it be an artefactual result?
Concerning signs and symptoms Include a fast irregular pulse, chest pain, weak-
ness, palpitations, and light-headedness. ECG: (see fi g 14.4) tall tented T waves, small
P waves, a wide QRS complex (eventually becoming sinusoidal), and ventricular fi bril-
lation.
Artefactual results: If the patient is well, and has none of the above-mentioned
fi ndings, repeat the test urgently as it may be artefactual, caused by: •haemolysis
(diffi cult vene puncture; patient clenched fi st) •contamination with potassium EDTA
anticoagulant in FBC bottles (do FBCS after U&ES) •thrombocythaemia (K+ leaks out of
platelets during clotting) •delayed analysis (K+ leaks out of RBCS; a particular problem
in a primary care setting due to long transit times to the lab).5
Causes
• Oliguric renal failure. • Addison’s disease (see p226).
• K+-sparing diuretics. • Massive blood transfusion.
• Rhabdomyolysis (p319). • Burns.
• Metabolic acidosis (DM). • Drugs, eg ACE-i, suxamethonium.
• Excess K+ therapy. • Artefactual result (see earlier ‘Artefactual results’).
Treatment in non-urgent cases
Treat the underlying cause; review medications.
• Polystyrene sulfonate resin (eg Calcium Resonium® 15g/8h PO) binds K+ in the gut,
preventing absorption and bringing K+ levels down over a few days. If vomiting
prevents PO administration, give a 30g enema, followed at 9h by colonic irrigation.
Emergency treatment
If there is evidence of myocardial hyperexcitability, or K+ is >6.5mmol/L, get senior
assistance, and treat as an emergency (see p301).
Hypokalaemia
If K+ <2.5mmol/L, urgent treatment is required. Note that hypokalaemia exacerbates
digoxin toxicity.
Signs and symptoms Muscle weakness, hypotonia, hyporefl exia, cramps, tetany,
palpitations, light-headedness (arrhythmias), constipation.
ECG Small or inverted T waves, prominent U waves (after T wave), a long PR interval,
and depressed ST segments.
Causes
• Diuretics. • Cushing’s syndrome/steroids/ACTH.
• Vomiting and diarrhoea. • Conn’s syndrome.
• Pyloric stenosis. • Alkalosis.
• Rectal villous adenoma. • Purgative and liquorice abuse.
• Intestinal fi stula. • Renal tubular failure (p316 & p664).
If on diuretics, HCO3Ω is the best indication that hypokalaemia is likely to have been
long-standing. Mg2+ may be low, and hypokalaemia is often diffi cult to correct until
Mg2+ levels are normalized. Suspect Conn’s syndrome if hypertensive, hypokalaemic
alkalosis in someone not taking diuretics (p228).
In hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, intermittent weakness lasting up to 72h ap-
pears to be caused by K+ shifting from extra- to intracellular fl uid. See OHCS p652.
Treatment If mild: (>2.5mmol/L, no symptoms.) Give oral K+ supplement
(≥80mmol/24h, eg Sando-K® 2 tabs/8h). Review K+ after 3 days. If taking a thi-
azide diuretic, and K+ >3.0 consider repeating and/or K+-sparing diuretic. If severe:
(<2.5mmol/L, and/or dangerous symptoms.) Give IV potassium cautiously, not more
than 20mmol/h, and not more concentrated than 40mmol/L. Do not give K+ if oliguric.
Never give K+ as a fast stat bolus dose.

Calcium and phosphate physiology
Calcium and phosphate homeostasis is maintained through:
Parathyroid hormone (PTH): Overall eff ect is Ca2+ & PO43Ω. Secretion by four para-
thyroid glands is triggered by serum ionized Ca2+; controlled by Ωve feedback loop.
Actions are: •osteoclast activity releasing Ca2+ and PO43Ω from bones •Ca2+ & PO43Ω
reabsorption in the kidney •renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3.
Vitamin D and calcitriol: Vit D is hydroxylated fi rst in the liver to 25-hydroxy-vit D,
and again in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxy-vit D (calcitriol), the biologically active form,
and 24,25-hydroxy-vit D (inactive). Calcitriol production is stimulated by Ca2+, PO43Ω,
and PTH. Actions are: •Ca2+ and PO43Ω absorption from the gut •inhibition of PTH
release •enhanced bone turnover •Ca2+ and PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney. Chole-
calciferol (vit D3—from animal sources) and ergocalciferol (vit D2—from vegetables)
are biologically identical in their activity. Disordered regulation of calcitriol underlies
familial normocalca emic hypercalciuria, which is a major cause of calcium oxalate
renal stone formation (p638).
Calcitonin: Made in C-cells of the thyroid, this causes Ca2+ and PO43Ω, but its physi-
ological role is unclear. It can be used as a marker of recurrence or metastasis in
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.
Magnesium: Mg2+ prevents PTH release, and may cause hypocalcaemia.
Plasma binding: Labs usually measure total plasma Ca2+. ~40% is bound to albumin,
and the rest is free ionized Ca2+ which is the physiologically important amount (often
available on blood gas analyser). Therefore, correct total Ca2+ for albumin as follows:
add 0.1mmol/L to Ca2+ level for every 4g/L that albumin is below 40g/L, and a similar
subtraction for raised albumin. However, many other factors aff ect binding (eg other
proteins in myeloma, cirrhosis, individual variation) so be cautious in your interpreta-
tion. If in doubt over a high Ca2+, take blood specimens uncuff ed (remove tourniquet
after needle in vein, but before taking blood sample), and with the patient fasted.
Hypercalcaemia
Signs and symptoms ‘Bones, stones, groans, and psychic moans.’ Abdominal pain;
vomiting; constipation; polyuria; polydipsia; depression; anorexia; weight loss; tired-
ness; weakness; hypertension, confusion; pyrexia; renal stones; renal failure; ectopic
calcifi cation (eg cornea—see BOX); cardiac arrest. ECG: QT interval.
Causes (See fi g 14.5.) Most commonly malignancy (eg from bone metastases, mye-
loma, PTHrP) or primary hyperparathyroidism. Others include sarcoidosis, vit D intoxi-
cation, thyrotoxicosis, lithium, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome,
and familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia (rare; defect in calcium-sensing
receptor). HIV can cause both  & Ca2+ (perhaps from PTH-related bone remodelling).6
Investigations The main distinction is malignancy vs 1° hyperparathyroidism.
Pointers to malignancy are albumin, ClΩ, alkal osis, K+, PO43Ω, ALP. PTH indicates
hyperparathyroidism. Also FBC, protein electrophoresis, CXR, isotope bone scan, 24h
urinary Ca2+ excretion (for familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia).
Causes of metastatic (ectopic) calcifi cation ‘PARATTHORMONE’
Parathormone (PTH) (p222) and other causes of Ca2+, eg sarcoidosis; Amyloidosis;
Renal failure (relates to PO43Ω); Addison’s disease (adrenal calcifi cation);
TB nodes; Toxoplasmosis (CNS); Histoplasmosis (eg in lung); Overdose of vitamin D;
Raynaud’s-associated diseases (eg SLE; systemic sclerosis p552; dermatomyositis);
Muscle primaries/leiomyosarcomas); Ossifying metastases (Osteosarcoma) or Ovar-
ian mets (to peritoneum); Nephrocalcinosis; Endocrine tumours (eg gastrinoma).

1 This diagram is only a guide: use in conjunction with the clinical picture.
2 Most common primary: breast, kidney, lung, thyroid, prostate, ovary, colon.
3 Ingesting too much calcium and alkali (eg in milk) can cause hypercalcaemia with metastatic calcifi ca-
tion and renal failure. Thyrotoxicosis causes alkalaemia because of hyperventilation.7
Treating acute hypercalcaemia
Diagnose and treat the underlying cause. If Ca2+ >3.5mmol/L and symptomatic:
1 Correct dehydration: If dehydrated give IV 0.9% saline.
2 Bisphosphonates: These prevent bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast ac-
tivity. A single dose of pamidronate lowers Ca2+ over 2–3d; maximum eff ect is
at 1wk. Infuse slowly, eg 30mg in 300mL 0.9% saline over 3h via a largish vein.
Max dose 90mg (see table 14.4). Zoledronic acid is signifi cantly more eff ective
in reducing serum Ca2+ than previously used bisphosphonates.8 Usually, a single
dose of 4mg IV (diluted to 100mL, over 15min) will normalize plasma Ca2+ within
a week. SE, fl u symptoms, PO43Ω, bone pain, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, head-
ache, lymphocytopenia, Mg2+, Ca2+, seizures.
3 Further management: Chemotherapy may help in malignancy. Steroids are
used in sarcoidosis, eg prednisolone 40–60mg/d. Salmon calcitonin acts similar-
ly to bisphosphonates, and has a quicker onset of action, but is now rarely used.
NB: the use of furosemide is contentious, as supporting RCT evidence is scant.9,10
It helps to promote renal excretion of Ca2+, but can exacerbate hypercalcaemia
by worsening dehydration. Thus it should only be used once fully rehydrated,
and with concomitant IV fl uids (eg 0.9% saline 1L/4–6h). Avoid thiazides.

Hypocalcaemia
Apparent hypocalcaemia may be an artefact of hypoalbuminaemia (p676).
Signs and symptoms See BOX.11 Mild: cramps, perioral numbness/paraesthesiae.
Severe: carpopedal spasm (especially if brachial artery compressed, Trousseau’s
sign; see fi g 14.6), laryngos pasm, seizures. Neuromuscular excitability may also be
demonstrated by tapping over parotid (facial nerve) causing facial muscles to twitch
(Chvostek’s sign; see fi g 14.7). Cataract if chronic hypocalcaemia. ECG: Long QT interval.
Causes With PO43Ω With  or PO43Ω
• Chronic kidney disease (p302). • Vitamin D defi ciency.
• Hypoparathyroidism (incl thyroid • Osteomalacia (ALP).
or parathyroid surgery, p222). • Acute pancreatitis.

• Acute rhabdomyolysis. • Respiratory alkalosis (total Ca2+
• Hypomagnesaemia. is normal, but ionized Ca2+ due
to pH  symptomatic).
Treatment
• Mild symptoms: Give calcium 5mmol/6h PO, with daily plasma Ca2+ levels.
• In chronic kidney disease: See p302. May require alfacalcidol, eg 0.5–1mcg/24h PO.
• Severe symptoms: Give 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate (2.25mmol) IV over 30min,
and repeat as necessary. If due to respiratory alkalosis, correct the alkalosis.

Phosphate
Hypophosphataemia Common and of little signifi cance unless severe (<0.4mmol/L).
Causes: Vitamin D defi ciency, alcohol withdrawal, refeeding syndrome (p587), in-
adequate oral intake, severe diabetic ketoacidosis, renal tubular dysfunction and
1° hyperparathyroidism. Signs and symptoms: Muscle weakness or rhabdomyoly-
sis, red cell, white cell and platelet dysfunction, and cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
Treatment: Oral or parenteral phosphate supplementation, eg Phosphate Polyfu-
sor® IVI (100mmol PO43Ω in 500mL). Never give IV phosphate to a patient who is
hypercalcaemic or oliguric.
Hyperphosphataemia Most commonly due to chronic kidney disease, when it is
treated with phosphate binders, eg sevelamer 800mg/8h PO during meals. Also cata-
bolic states such as tumour lysis syndrome (p529).
Magnesium
Magnesium is distributed 65% in bone and 35% in cells; plasma concentration tends
to follow that of Ca2+ and K+.
Hypomagnesaemia Causes paraesthesiae, ataxia, seizures, tetany, arrhythmias.
Digitalis toxicity may be exacerbated. Causes: Diuretics, severe diarrhoea, ke-
toacidosis, alcohol abuse, total parenteral nutrition (monitor weekly), Ca2+, K+, and
PO43Ω. Treatment: If needed, give magnesium salts, PO or IV (eg 8mmol MgSO4 IV
over 3min to 2h, depending on severity, with frequent Mg2+ levels).
Hypermagnesaemia Rarely requires treatment unless severe (>7.5mmol/L).
Causes: Renal failure or iatrogenic (eg excessive antacids). Signs: If severe: neuro-
muscular depression, BP, pulse, hypor efl exia, CNS & respiratory depression, coma.
Zinc
Zinc defi ciency This may occur in parenteral nutrition or, rarely, from a poor diet
(too few cereals and dairy products; anorexia nervosa; alcoholism). Rarely it is due
to a genetic defect. Symptoms: Alopecia, dermatitis (look for red, crusted skin le-
sions especially around nostrils and corners of mouth), night blindness, diarrhoea.
Diagnosis: Therapeutic trial of zinc (plasma levels are unreliable as they may be low,
eg in infection or trauma, without defi ciency).
Selenium
An essential element present in cereals, nuts, and meat. Low soil levels in some
parts of Europe and China cause defi ciency states. Required for the antioxidant
glutathione peroxidase, which  harmful free radicals. Selenium is also antithrom-
bogenic, and is required for sperm motility proteins. Defi ciency may increase risk
of neoplasia and atheroma, and may lead to a cardiomyopathy or arthritis. Serum
levels are a poor guide. Toxic symptoms may also be found with over-energetic re-
placement.

Urate and the kidney
Causes of hyperuricaemia High levels of urate in the blood (hyperuricaemia) may
result from increased turnover (15%) or reduced excretion of urate (85%). Either
may be drug induced.
• Drugs: Cytotoxics, thiazides, loop diuretics, pyrazinamide.
• Increased cell turnover: Lymphoma, leukaemia, psoriasis, haemolysis, muscle
death (rhabdomyolysis, p319; tumour lysis syndrome, p529).
• Reduced excretion: Primary gout (p548), chronic kidney disease, lead nephropathy,
hyperparathyroidism, pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48).
• Other: Hyperuricaemia may be associated with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia.
Urate may be raised in disorders of purine synthesis such as the Lesch–Nyhan
syndrome (OHCS p648).
Hyperuricaemia and renal failure Severe renal failure from any cause may be
associated with hyperuricaemia, and rarely this may give rise to gout. Sometimes
the relationship of cause and eff ect is reversed so that it is the hyperuricaemia that
causes the renal failure. This can occur following cytotoxic treatment (tumour lysis
syndrome, p529), and in muscle necrosis.
How urate causes renal failure: Urate is poorly soluble in water, so over-excretion
can lead to crystal precipitation. Renal failure occurs most commonly because urate
precipitates in the renal tubules. This may occur at plasma levels ≥1 . 19mmol/L. In
some instances, ureteric obstruction from urate crystals may occur. This responds
to retrograde ureteric catheterization and lavage.
Prevention of renal failure: Before starting chemotherapy, ensure good hydration
and initiate allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) or rasburicase (recombinant
urate oxidase), which prevent a sharp rise in urate following chemotherapy (see
p528). There is a remote risk of inducing xanthine nephropathy.
Treatment of hyperuricaemic acute kidney injury: Exclude bilateral ureteric ob-
struction, then give prompt rehydration ± loop diuretic to wash uric acid crystals
out of the renal tubules, and correct electrolyte abnormalities. Once oliguria is es-
tablished, haemodialysis is required (in preference to peritoneal dialysis). There is no
evidence for either preventing (see previous paragraph) or treating hyperuricaemic
renal failure.
Gout See p548.
Urate renal stones Urate stones (fi g 14.8) comprise
5–10% of all renal stones and are radiolucent.
Incidence: ~5–10% in temperate climates (double
if confi rmed gout), 12 but up to 40% in hot, arid cli-
mates. :≈4:1. But most urate stone formers have
no detectable abnormalities in urate metabolism.
Risk factors: Acidic or strongly concentrated urine;
urinary excretion of urate; chronic diarrhoea; distal
small bowel disease or resection (regional enteritis);
ileostomy; obesity; diabetes mellitus; chemotherapy
for myeloproliferative disorders; inadequate caloric
or fl uid intake.
Treatment: Hydration to increase urine volume (aim
>2L/d). Unlike most other renal calculi, existing uric
acid stones can often be dissolved with either systemic Fig 14.8 Urate stone.

potassium bicarbonate at a dose titrated to alkalinize the urine to a pH of 6–7 dis-
solves some urate stones. If hyperuricosuria, consider dietary management ± al-

Metabolic bone diseases: osteoporosis
Osteoporosis implies reduced bone mass. It may be 1° (age-related) or 2° to another
condition or drugs. If trabecular bone is aff ected, crush fractures of vertebrae are
common (hence the ‘littleness’ of little old ladies and their dowager’s hump); if cortical
bone is aff ected, long bone fractures are more likely, eg femoral neck: the big cause of
death and orthopaedic expense (80% hip fractures in the UK occur in women >50yrs).
Prevalence (In those >50yrs):  6%,  18%. Women lose trabeculae with age, but
in men, although there is reduced bone formation, numbers of trabeculae are stable
and their lifetime risk of fracture is less.
Risk factors Age-independent risk factors for 1° osteoporosis: parental history,
alcohol >4 units daily, rheumatoid arthritis, BMI <19, prolonged immobility, and un-
treated menopause. See BOX ‘Osteoporosis risk factors’ for other risk factors, includ-
ing for 2° osteoporosis.
Investigations X-ray (low sensitivity/specifi city, often with hindsight after a
fracture). Bone densitometry (DEXA—see BOX ‘DEXA bone densitometry’; table 14.5).
Bloods: Ca2+, PO43Ω, and ALP normal. Consider specifi c investigations for 2° causes
if suggestive history. Biopsy is unreliable and unnecessary with non-invasive tech-
niques available.
Management Loss of bone mineral density may not be entirely irreversible. Age,
number of risk factors, and bone mineral density (DEXA scan; see BOX ‘DEXA bone den-
sitometry’) guide the pharmacological approach (eg FRAX, which is a WHO risk assess-
ment tool for estimating 10-yr risk of osteoporotic fracture in untreated patients; see
www.shef.ac.uk/frax),13,14 although DEXA is not necessary if age >75yrs. Lifestyle measures
should apply to all (including those at risk but not yet osteoporotic).
Lifestyle measures:
• Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.
• Weight-bearing exercise may increase bone mineral density.15
• Balance exercises such as tai chi reduce risk of falls.
• Calcium and vitamin D-rich diet (use supplements if diet is insuffi cient—see ‘Phar-
macological measures’ later in this topic).
• Home-based fall-prevention programme, with visual assessment and a home visit.
NB: hip-protectors are unreliable for preventing fractures.16
Pharmacological measures:
• Bisphosphonates: alendronic acid is 1st line (10mg/d or 70mg/wk; not if eGFR <35).
Use also for prevention in long-term steroid use. If intolerant, try etidronate or rise-
dronate. Tell patient to swallow pills with plenty of water while remaining upright for
>30min and wait 30min before eating or other drugs. (SE: photosensitivity; GI upset;
oesophageal ulcers—stop if dysphagia or abdo pain; rarely, jaw osteonecrosis).
• Calcium and vitamin D: rarely used alone for prophylaxis, as questionable effi cacy
and some evidence of a small CV risk. Off er if evidence of defi ciency, eg calcium
1g/d + vit D 800U/d. Target serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level ≥75nmol/L.
• Strontium ranelate: due to an increased risk of cardiac problems it should only be used
in those with severe intolerance of other agents and without cardiovascular disease.
• Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent (not treat) osteoporosis in post-
menopausal women. Relative risk of breast cancer is 1 . 4 if used >10yrs;  CV risk.
• Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts similarly to
HRT, but with  breast cancer risk.
• Teriparatide (recombinant PTH) is useful in those who suff er further fractures de-
spite treatment with other agents. There is a potential  risk of renal malignancy.
• Calcitonin may reduce pain after a vertebral fracture.
• Testosterone may help in hypo gonadal men by promoting trabecular connectivity.
• Denosumab, a monoclonal Ab to RANK ligand, given SC twice yearly  reabsorption.

DEXA bone densitometry: WHO osteoporosis criteria
It is better to scan the hip than the lumbar spine. Bone mineral density (g/cm2)
is compared with that of a young healthy adult. The ‘T-score’ is the number of
standard deviations (SD, p751) the bone mineral density (BMD) is from the youthful
average. Each decrease of 1 SD in BMD ≈ 2.6-fold  in risk of hip fracture.
Table 14.5 Interpreting DEXA bone scan results
T-score >0 BMD is better than the reference.
0 to Ω1 BMD is in the top 84%: no evidence of osteoporosis.
Ω1 to Ω2.5 Osteopenia. Risk of later osteoporotic fracture. Off er lifestyle advice.
Ω2.5 or worse Osteoporosis. Off er lifestyle advice and treatment (p682). Repeat
DEXA in 2yrs.
Some indications for DEXA:
• NICE suggests DEXA if previous low-trauma fracture, or for women ≥ 65yrs with one
or more risk factors for osteoporosis, or younger if two or more. The benefi ts of
universal screening for osteoporosis remain unproven, but some authorities rec-
ommend this for men and women over 70—and earlier if risk factors are present.17
• DEXA is not needed pre-treatment for women over 75yrs if previous low-trauma
fracture, or ≥ 2 present of rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol excess, or positive family
history.
• Prior to giving long-term predniso lone (eg 3 months at >5mg/d). Steroids cause
osteoporosis by promoting osteoclast bone resorption, muscle mass, and Ca2+
absorption from the gut.
• Men or women with osteopenia if low-trauma, non-vertebral fracture.
• Bone and bone-remodelling disorders (eg parathyroid disorders, myeloma,
HIV, esp. if on protease inhibitors).
Osteoporosis risk factors: ‘SHATTERED’
Steroid use of >5mg/d of prednisolone.
Hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalciuria.
Alcohol and tobacco use .
Thin (BMI <18.5).
Testosterone  (eg antia ndrogen ca prostate ).
Early menopause.
Renal or liver failure.
Erosive/infl ammatory bone disease (eg myeloma or rheumatoid arthritis).
Dietary Ca2+/malab sorption; diabetes mellitus type 1.

Metabolic bone diseases: osteomalacia
In osteomalacia, there is a normal amount of bone but its mineral content is low
(there is excess uncalcifi ed osteoid and cartilage). This is the reverse of osteoporosis
in which mineralization is unchanged, but there is overall bone loss. Rickets is the
result if this process occurs during the period of bone growth; osteomalacia is the
result if it occurs after fusion of the epiphyses.
Signs and symptoms
Rickets: Growth retardation, hypotonia, apathy in infants. Once walking: knock-
kneed, bow-legged, and deformities of the metaphyseal–epiphyseal junction (eg the
rachitic rosary). Features of Ca2+—often mild (p678). Children with rickets are ill.
Osteomalacia: Bone pain and tenderness; fractures (esp. femoral neck); proximal
myopathy (waddling gait), due to PO43Ω and vitamin D defi ciency per se.
Causes
Vitamin D defi ciency: Due to malabsorption (p266), poor diet, or lack of sunlight.
Renal osteodystrophy: Renal failure leads to 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol defi cien-
cy [1,25(OH)2-vitamin D defi ciency]. See also renal bone disease (p312).
Drug-induced: Anticonvulsants may induce liver enzymes, leading to an increased
breakdown of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D.
Vitamin D resistance: A number of mainly inherited conditions in which the os-
teomalacia responds to high doses of vitamin D (see ‘Treatment’ later in this topic).
Liver disease: Due to reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D to 25-hydroxy-cholecalcif-
erol and malabsorption of vitamin D, eg in cirrhosis (p276).
Tumour-induced osteomalacia: (Oncogenic hypophosphataemia.) Mediated by
raised tumour production of phosphato nin fi broblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) which
causes hyperphosphaturia. serum PO43Ω often causes myalgia and weakness.18
Investigations
Plasma: Mildly Ca2+ (but may be severe); PO43Ω; ALP; PTH high; 25(OH)-vitamin D,
except in vitamin D resistance. In renal failure, 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (p312).
Biopsy: Bone biopsy shows incomplete mineralization. Muscle biopsy (if proximal
myopathy) is normal.
X-ray: In osteomalacia, there is a loss of cortical bone; also, apparent partial frac-
tures without displacement may be seen especially on the lateral border of the
scapula, inferior femoral neck, and medial femoral shaft (Looser’s zones; see fi g 14.9).
Cupped, ragged metaphyseal surfaces are seen in rickets (fi g 14.10).
Treatment
• In dietary insuffi ciency, give vitamin D, eg as one calcium D3 forte tablet/12h PO.
• In malabsorption or hepatic disease, give vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), up to 40 000U
(=1mg) daily, or parenteral calcitriol, eg 7.5mg monthly.
• If due to renal disease or vitamin D resistance, give alfacalcidol (1-hydroxy-
vitamin D3) 250ng–1mcg daily, or calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) 250ng–1mcg
daily, and adjust dose according to plasma Ca2+. Alfacalcidol and calcitriol can
cause dangerous hypercalcaemia.
• Monitor plasma Ca2+, initially weekly, and if nausea/vomiting.
Vitamin D-resistant rickets Exists in two forms. Type I has low renal 1-hydroxy-
lase activity, and type II has end-organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, due
to a point mutation in the receptor. Both are treated with large doses of calcitriol.
X-linked hypophosphataemic rickets Dominantly inherited—due to a defect in
renal phosphate handling (due to mutations in the PEX or PHEX genes which encode
an endopeptidase). Rickets develops in early childhood and is associated with poor
growth. Plasma PO43Ω is low, ALP is high, and there is phosphaturia. Treatm ent is with
high doses of oral phosphate, and calcitriol.

Metabolic bone diseases: Paget’s disease of bone
Also called osteitis deformans, there is increased bone turnover associated with
increased numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts with resultant remodelling, bone
enlargement, deformity, and weakness. Rare in the under-40s. Incidence rises with
age (3% over 55yrs old). Commoner in temperate climates, and in Anglo-Saxons.
Clinical features Asymptomatic in ~70%. Deep, boring pain, and bony deformity
and enlargement—typically of the pelvis, lumbar spine, skull, femur, and tibia (clas-
sically a bowed sabre tibia; fi g 14.11). Complications include pathological fractures,
osteoa rthritis, Ca2+, nerve compression due to bone overgrowth (eg deafness, root
compression), high-output CCF (if >40% of skeleton involved), and osteosarcoma (<1%
of those aff ected for >10yrs—suspect if sudden onset or worsening of bone pain).19
Radiology X-ray Localized enlargement of bone. Patchy cortical thickening with
sclerosis, osteolysis, and deformity (eg osteoporosis circumscripta of the skull). Af-
fi nity for axial skeleton, long bones, and skull. Bone scan may reveal ‘hot spots’.
Blood chemistry Ca2+ and PO43Ω normal; ALP markedly raised.
Treatment If analgesia fails, alendronic acid may be tried to reduce pain and/or
deformity. It is more eff ective than etidronate or calcitonin, and as eff ective as IV
pamidronate. Follow expert advice.

Plasma proteins
The plasma contains a number of proteins including albumin, immunoglobulins, 1-
antitrypsin, 2-macroglobulin, caeruloplasmin, transferrin, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL), fi brinogen, complement, and factor VIII. The most abundant is albumin (see
fi g 14.12).
Albumin Synthesized in the liver; t½ ≈ 20d. It binds bilirubin, free fatty acids, Ca2+,
and some drugs. Low albumin: Results in oedema, and is caused by: •synthesis:
liver disease, acute phase response (due to vascular permeability—eg sepsis, trau-
ma, surgery), malabsorption, malnutrition, malignancy •loss: nephrotic syndrome,
protein-losing enteropathy, burns •haemodilution: late pregnancy, artefact (eg from
‘drip’ arm). Also posture (5g/L if upright) and genetic variations. High albumin:
Causes are dehydration; artefact (eg stasis).
Immunoglobulins (Antibodies) are synthesized by B cells. Five isoforms Ig
A,D,E,G,M exist in humans, and IgG is the most abundant circulating form. Specifi c
monoclonal band in paraproteinaemia (see p370). Diffusely raised in chronic infec-
tions, TB, bronchiectasis, liver cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, SLE, RA, Crohn’s disease, 1° biliary
cirrhosis, hepatitis, and parasitaemia. Low in nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption,
malnutrition, and immune defi ciency states (eg severe illness, renal failure, diabetes
mellitus, malignancy, or congenital).
Acute phase response The body responds to a variety of insults with, among other
things, the synthesis, by the liver, of a number of proteins (normally present in serum
in small quantities)—eg 1-antitrypsin, fi brinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and
CRP. A concomitant reduction in albumin level, is characteristic of conditions such
as infection, malignancy (especially 2-fraction), trauma, surgery, and infl ammatory
disease.
CRP So called because it binds to a polysaccharide (fraction C) in the cell wall of pneu-
mococci. Levels help monitor infl ammation/infection (normal <8mg/L). Like the ESR,
it is raised in many infl ammatory conditions, but changes more rapidly. It increases
in hours and begins to fall within 2–3d of recovery; thus it can be used to follow
disease activity (eg Crohn’s disease) or the response to therapy (eg antibiotics). CRP
values in mild infl ammation 10–50mg/L; active bacterial infection 50–200mg/L; se-
vere infection or trauma >200mg/L; see table 14.6.
Urinary proteins
Urinary protein loss >150mg/d is pathological (p294).
Albuminuria Usually caused by renal disease (p294). Microalbuminuria: Urinary
protein loss between 30 and 300mg/d (so not visible on normal dipstick) and may
be seen with diabetes mellitus, BP, SLE, and glomerulonephritis (see p314 for role
in DM). Can also be quantifi ed by measuring the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio
(A:CR), usually a fi rst-in-the-morning spot urine sample. A level >30mg/mmol indi-
cates albuminuria, and microalbuminuria is defi ned as >2.5mg/mmol in men and >3.5
in women. This is a useful screening test in diabetics, and subjects with reduced
eGFR. Note some labs measure total urinary protein not albumin—a P:CR of 50, is
equivalent to an A:CR of 30.20
Bence Jones protein Consists of light chains excreted in excess by some patients
with myeloma (p368). They are not detected by dipsticks and may occur with
normal serum electrophoresis.
Haemoglobinuria Caused by intravascular haemolysis (p336).
Myoglobinuria Caused by rhabdomyolysis (p319).

Plasma enzymes
Reference intervals vary between laboratories. See p752 for a guide to normal values.
Raised levels of specifi c enzymes can be a useful indicator of a disease. However,
remember that most can be raised for other reasons too. Levels may be raised due
to cellular damage, cell turnover, cellular proliferation (malignancy), enzyme induc-
tion, and clearance. The major causes of raised enzymes:
Alkaline phosphatase (Several distinguishable isoforms exist, eg liver and bone.)
• Liver disease (suggests cholestasis; also cirrhosis, abscess, hepatitis, or malignancy).
• Bone disease (isoenzyme distinguishable, refl ects osteoblast activity) especially
Paget’s, growing children, healing fractures, bone metastases, osteomalacia, os-
teomyelitis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism.
• Congestive cardiac failure (moderately raised).
• Pregnancy (placenta makes its own isoenzyme).
Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST)
• Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).
• AST also  in MI, skeletal muscle damage (especially crush injuries), and haemolysis.
-Amylase
• Acute pancreatitis (smaller rise in chronic pancreatitis as less tissue remaining).
• Also: severe uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe gastroenteritis, and peptic ulcer.
Creatine kinase (CK) A raised CK does not necessarily mean an MI.
• Myocardial infarction (p118; isoenzyme ‘CK-MB’. Diagnostic if CK-MB >6% of total CK,
or CK-MB mass >99 percentile of normal). CK returns to baseline within 48h (unlike
troponin, which remains raised for ~10 days),  useful for detecting re-infarction.
• Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis, p319; prolonged running; haematoma; seizures;
IM injection; defi brillation; bowel ischaemia; myxoedema; dermatomyositis, p552)—
and drugs (eg statins).
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, GT)
• Liver disease (particularly alcohol-induced damage, cholestasis, drugs).
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
• Myocardial infarction (p118).
• Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).
• Haemolysis (esp. sickle cell crisis), pulmonary embolism, and tumour necrosis.
Troponin
• Subtypes troponin T and troponin I are used clinically.
• Cardiac damage or strain (MI—p118, pericarditis, myocarditis, PE, sepsis, CPR).
• Chronic kidney disease (troponin T only; elevation less marked; aetiology unknown).

Enzyme inducers and inhibitors
Hepatic drug metabolism is mainly by conjugation or oxidation. The oxidative
pathways are catalysed by the family of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, the most
important of which is the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme. The cytochrome P450 pathway may
be either induced or inhibited by a range of commonly used drugs and foods (table
14.7).
This can lead to important interactions or side-eff ects. For example, phenytoin
reduces the eff ectiveness of the contraceptive pill due to more rapid oestrogen
metabolism, and ciprofl oxacin retards the metabolism of methylxanthines (ami-
nophylline) which leads to higher plasma levels and potentially more side-eff ects.
The BNF contains a list of the major interactions between drugs.

Hyperlipidaemia
Lipids travel in blood packaged with proteins as lipoproteins. There are four classes:
chylomicrons and VLDL (mainly triglyceride), LDL (mainly cholesterol), and HDL (mainly
phospho lipid) (for abbreviations see footnote3). The evidence that cholesterol is a
major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is undisputed (‘4S’ STUDY, 21 WOSCOPS, 22
CARE STUDY, 23 HEART PROTECTION STUDY 24) and indeed it may even be the ‘green light’ that
allows other risk factors to act. 25 Half the UK population have a serum cholesterol
putting them at signifi cant risk of CVD. HDL appears to correlate inversely with CVD.
Who to screen for hyperlipidaemia
NB: full screening requires a fasting lipid profi le.
Those at risk of hyperlipidaemia: •Family history of hyperlipidaemia. •Corneal ar-
cus <50yrs old. •Xanthomata or xanthelasmata (fi g 14.13).
Those at risk of CVD: •Known CVD. •Family history of CVD <60yrs old. •DM or impaired
glucose tolerance. •Hypertension. •Smoker. •BMI. •Low socioeconomic or Indian
Asian background.
Types of hyperlipidaemia
Common primary hyperlipidaemia: Accounts for 70% of hyperlipidaemia. LDL only.
Familial primary hyperlipidaemias: Multiple phenotypes exist (see table 14.8). Risk
of CVD, although evidence suggests protection from CVD is achieved with lower
doses of statin than for common primary hyperlipidaemia. 26 Refer to specialist.
Secondary hyperlipidaemia: Causes include: Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism,
nephrotic syndrome, or cholestasis. LDL. Treat the cause fi rst.
Mixed hyperlipidaemia: Results in  in both LDL and triglycerides. Caused by type
2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure.
Management
Identify familial or 2° hyperlipidaemias, as  may diff er. Give lifestyle advice; aim for
BMI of 20–25; encourage a Mediterranean-style diet—fruit, vegetables, fi sh, unsatu-
rated fats; and red meat; exercise. Top  priority are those with known CVD (there
is no need to calculate their risk: ipso facto they already have high risk). Second
 priority is primary prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease or type-1
diabetes, and those with a 10-yr risk of CVD >10%, irrespective of baseline lipid levels.
• 1st-line therapy: Atorvastatin 20mg PO at night, for primary prevention, and 80mg
for secondary prevention and primary prevention in those with kidney disease.27
Simvastatin 40mg, is an alternative. cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibit-
ing HMGCOA reductase. CI: porphyria, cholestasis, pregnancy. SE: myalgia ± myositis
(stop if CK ≥10-fold; if any myalgia, check CK; risk is 1 per 100 000 treatment-years),28
abdominal pain, and LFTS (stop if AST 100U/L). Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (p689)
serum concentrations (200mL of grapefruit juice simvastatin concentration by
300%, and atorvastatin 80%, but pravastatin is almost unchanged). Current guide-
lines suggest a target plasma cholesterol reduction of ≥40 % in those with CVD.
• 2nd-line therapy: Ezetimibe—a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, may be used in
statin intolerance or combination with statins to achive target reduction.
• 3rd-line therapy: Alirocumab—a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 (acts to
reduce hepatocyte LDL receptor expression). Very eff ective in reducing LDL,29 but
expensive and needs to be given by injection every 2 weeks. Others: fi brates, eg
bezafi brate (useful in mixed hyperlipidaemias); anion exchange resins, eg colesty-
ramine; nicotinic acid (HDL; LDL; SE: severe fl ushes; aspirin 300mg ½h pre-dose
helps this).
• Hypertriglyceridaemia: Responds best to fi brates, nicotinic acid, or fi sh oil.
Xanthomata These yellow lipid deposits may be: eruptive (itchy nodules in crops
in hypertriglyceridaemia); tuberous (plaques on elbows and knees); or planar—also
called palmar (orange streaks in palmar creases), ‘diagnostic’ of remnant hyperlipid-
aemia; or in tendons (p38), eyelids (xanthelasma, see fi g 14.13), or cornea (arcus, p39).

The porphyrias
The porphyrias are a heterogenous group of rare diseases caused by various er-
rors of haem biosynthesis (produced when iron is chelated into protoporphyrin IX),
which may be genetic or acquired. Depending on the stage in haem biosynthesis that
is faulty, there is accumulation of either porphyrinogens, which are unstable and
oxidize to porphyrins, or their precursors, porphobilinogen and -aminolaevulinic
acid. Porphyrin precursors are neurotoxic, while porphyrins themselves induce pho-
tosensitivity and the formation of toxic free radicals.
• Alcohol, lead, and iron defi ciency cause abnormal porphyrin metabolism.
• Genetic counselling (OHCS p154) should be off ered to all patients and their families.
Acute porphyrias Occur when the accumulation of porphyrinogen precursors pre-
dominates, and are characterized by acute neurovisceral crises, though some forms
have additional photosensitive cutaneous manifestations.
Acute intermittent porphyria: (‘The Madness of King George.’) A low-penetrant
autosomal dominant condition (porphobilinogen deaminase gene); 28% have no
family history (de novo mutations). ~10% of those with the defective gene have
neurovisceral symptoms. Attacks are intermittent, more common in women and
those aged 18–40, and may be precipitated by drugs. Urine porphobilinogens are
raised during attacks (the urine may go deep red on standing) and also, in ~50%, be-
tween attacks. Faecal porphyrin levels are normal. There is never cutaneous photo-
sensitivity. It is the commonest form of porphyria—prevalence in UK: 1–2/100 000.
Variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria: Autosomal dominant, char-
acterized by photosensitive blistering skin lesions and/or acute attacks. The former
is prevalent in Afrikaners in South Africa. Porphobilinogen is high only during an
attack, and other metabolites may be detected in faeces.
Triggers of an acute attack: Include infection, starvation (including pre-operative
‘nil-by-mouth’), reproductive hormones (pregnancy, premenstrual), smoking, anaes-
thesia, and cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (alcohol, and other drugs—see BOX).
Features of an acute attack:
• Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation.
• Neuropsychiatric: peripheral neuropathy (weakness, hypotonia, pain, numbness),
seizures (often associated with severe Na+), psychosis (or other odd behaviour).4
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, shock (due to sympathetic overactivity).
• Other: fever, Na+, K+, proteinuria, urinary porphobilinogens, discoloured urine.
Rare but serious complications include bulbar and respiratory paralysis.
Beware the ‘acute abdomen’ in acute intermittent porphyria: colic, vomiting, fever,
and WCC—so mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Anaesthesia could be disastrous.
Treatment of an acute attack:
• Remove precipitants (review medications; treat intercurrent illness/infection).
• IV fl uids to correct electrolyte imbalance.
• High carbohydrate intake (eg Hycal®) by NG tube, or IV if necessary.
• IV haematin is 1st-line (inhibits production of porphyrinogen precursors).
• Nausea controlled with prochlorperazine 12.5mg IM.
• Sedate if necessary with chlorpromazine 50–100mg PO/IM.
• Pain control with opiate or opioid analgesia (avoid oxycodone).
• Seizures can be controlled with diazepam (although this will prolong the attack).
• Treat tachycardia and hypertension with a -blocker.
Non-acute porphyrias
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), erythropoietic protoporphyria, and congenital
erythro poietic porphyria are characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity alone,
as there is no overproduction of porphyrinogen precursors, only porphyrins. PCT pre-
sents in adults with blistering skin lesions ± facial hypertrichosis and hyperpigmen-
tation. Total plasma porphyrins and LFTS are . Screen for associated disorders: hep
C, HIV, iron overload, hepatocellular ca. : phlebotomy, iron chelators, chloroquine,
sunscreens.

4 Be sure I looked at her eyes
Happy and proud; at last I knew
Porphyria worshipped me; surprise
Made my heart swell, and still it grew
While I debated what to do.
That moment she was mine, mine, fair,
Perfectly pure and good: I found
A thing to do, and all her hair
In one long yellow string I wound
Three times her little throat around,
And strangled her …

15 Eponymous syndromes
Fig 15.1 ‘No scientifi c discovery is named af-
ter its original discoverer’, asserts Professor
Stephen Stigler in ‘Stigler’s Law of Eponymy ’,
and in doing so, names the sociologist RK
Merton as its discoverer—deliberately mak-
ing Stigler’s law exemplify itself. Is the same
true in medicine? At least six others described
Alzheimer’s disease before Alois Alzheimer
in 1906, and Tetralogy of Fallot (named after
Étienne-Louis Fallot in 1888) was fi rst de-
scribed in 1672 by Niels Stenson. Not all medical
eponyms obey Stigler’s law. Forty years after
it was fi rst described, the French neurologist
Jean-Marie Charcot (himself associated with at least 15 medical eponyms) attributed the name
‘Parkinson’s Disease’ to the illness outlined in James Parkinson’s 1817 essay ‘The Shaking Palsy ’.
Monochromatic doctors may try to abolish eponyms by regimenting them to histologically driven
disease titles. But classifi cations vary as facts emerge, and as a result the renaming of non-eponyms
becomes essential. Eponyms, however, carry on forever, because they imply nothing about causes.
Alice in Wonderland syndrome Altered perception in size and shape of body parts
or objects ± an impaired sense of passing time—as experienced by Alice in Lewis Car-
roll’s novel. Seen in epilepsy, migraine, and cerebral lesions.1,2Alice Pleasance Liddell, 1865–1934
Arnold–Chiari malformation Malformed cerebellar tonsils and medulla herniate
through the foramen magnum. This may cause infantile hydrocephalus with mental
retardation, optic atrophy, ocular palsies, and spastic paresis of the limbs. Spina bifi da,
syringomyelia (p516), or focal cerebellar and brainstem signs may occur (p499). There
may be bony abnormalities of the base of the skull. Often presents in early adulthood.
MRI aids diagnosis. Julius Arnold, 1835–1915 (German pathologist); Hans Chiari, 1851–1916 (Austrian pathologist)
Baker’s cyst Fluid from a knee eff usion escapes to form a popliteal cyst (often
swollen and painful) in a sub-gastrocnemius bursa.3 Usually secondary to degen-
eration.  : DVT (exclude if calf swelling); sarcoma. Imaging: USS; M RI. : None if
asymptomatic. NSAIDS/ice if painful. Spontaneous resolution may take 10–20 months.
Arthroscopy + cystectomy may be needed. William M Baker, 1838–1896 (British surgeon)
Bazin’s disease (Erythema induratum.) Localized areas of fat necrosis that pro-
duce painful, fi rm nodules ± ulceration and an indura ted rash, characteristically on
adolescent girls’ calves. It is associated with TB. Nodular vasculitis is a variant unre-
lated to TB.4 Pierre-Antoine-Ernest Bazin, 1807–1878 (French dermatologist)
Behçet’s disease A systemic infl ammatory disorder of unknown cause, associated
with HLA-B5. It is most common along the old Silk Road, from the Mediterranean
to China. Features: Recurrent oral and genital ulceration, uveitis, skin lesions (eg
erythema nodosum, papulopustular lesions); arthritis (non-erosive large joint oli-
goarthropathy); thrombophlebitis; vasculitis; myo/pericarditis; CNS involvement (py-
ramidal signs); and colitis. Diagnosis: Mainly clinical. Pathergy test: needle prick
leads to papule formation within 48hrs. : Colchicine for orogenital ulceration; ster-
oids, azathioprine/cyclophosphamide for systemic disease. Infl iximab has a role in
ocular disease unresponsive to topical steroids.5 Hulusi Behçet, 1889–1948 (Turkish dermatologist)
Berger’s disease (IgA nephropathy, p311.) Ranges from invisible haematuria to
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Biopsy shows mesangial IgA deposition. Usu-
ally indolent disease, but progression to end-stage renal failure occurs. : ACE-i/ARB if
BP or proteinuria. Immunosuppression considered for progressive disease.6
Jean Berger, 1930–2011 (French nephrologist)
Bickerstaff ’s brainstem encephalitis Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, arefl exia, and ex-
tensor plantars ± tetra plegia ± coma, and a reversible brain death picture (but there
is no structural damage). MRI: hyperintense brainstem signals. GQ1b antibodies +ve.7 Plas-

Barrett’s oesophagus
Barrett’s oesophagus is metaplasia of the normal stratifi ed squamous epithelium of
the distal oesophagus to a columnar epithelium, as a result of chronic GORD (p254).
Estimates of prevalence vary widely, but in patients with a history of symptomatic
GORD, rates of ≈8% have been reported. Importantly, screening studies in asympto-
matic individuals have reported rates of ≈6%. General population-based screening is
not recommended, although screening endoscopy may be considered in individuals
with chronic GORD symptoms and multiple risk factors (>50 years old, obesity, ,
white race, family history of Barrett's or oesophageal adenocarcinoma). Diagnosis:
Biopsy of endoscopically visible columnarization allows histological corroboration.
The length should be recorded (using the Prague classifi cation). Management:
Focus on detecting and preventing the most signifi cant associated morbidity:
oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of progression is low (0.1–0.4% per patient
per year, much lower than previously suggested). Risk factors for malignant trans-
formation include age, , long segment of oesophagus involved, and evidence of
dysplasia. Endoscopic surveillence for dysplasia is controversial and the evidence
base is lacking. Current guidelines suggest that patients without dysplasia and in
whom the length of involved oesophagus is <3cm should be considered for discharge
from surveillance programmes, depending on the precise histology.8 For those with
more extensive disease, endoscopic assessment every 2–3 years is appropriate. If
high-grade dysplasia or intramural carcinoma is detected, endoscopic resection or
mucosal radiofrequency abl ation (RFA) is recommended. If low-grade dysplasia is
detected, it should be confi rmed by repeat examination after 6 months and by an
independent pathologist, prior to RFA.9 Norman Rupert Barrett, 1903–1979 (British surgeon)
Brugada syndrome
Note right bundle branch block and the unusual
morphology of the raised ST segments in V1–V3
(fi g 15.2; there are three ECG variants of this
pattern). This predominently autosomal domi-
nant condition causing faulty sodium channels
predis poses to fatal arrhythmias (eg vent ricular
fi br illation), typically in young males (eg trig-
gered by a fever).10 It is preventable by implant-
ing a defi br il lator. Consider primary electrical
cardiac disease in all with unexplained syn-
cope. Programm ed electrical stimula tion may
be needed. Relatives of those with sudden
unex pl ained death may undergo unmaski ng of
arrhythmias by IV ajmaline tests—but some re-
sults are false +ve. Use judgement in subjecting

Brown-Séquard syndrome A lesion in one half of the spinal cord (due to hemi-
section or unilateral cord lesion) causes: •Ipsilateral UMN weakness below the lesion
(severed corticospinal tract, causing spastic paraparesis, brisk refl exes, extensor
plantars). •Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration (dorsal column severed).
•Contral ateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (severed spinothalamic tract
which has crossed over; fi g 10.35 p516). Causes: Bullet, stab, tumour, disc hernia, my-
elitis,12 septic emboli. Imaging: MRI. Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, 1817–1894 (Mauritian neurologist)
Budd–Chiari syndrome Hepatic vein obstruction by thrombosis or tumour causes
congestive ischaemia and hepatocyte damage. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, as-
cites, and ALT occur. Portal hyperte nsion occurs in chronic forms. Causes: Include
hypercoag ulable states (combined OCP, pregnancy, malignancy, paroxysmal noc-
turnal haemoglobin uria, polycythaemia, thrombophilia), TB, liver, renal, or adrenal
tumour. Tests: USS + Dopplers, CT, or MRI. Angioplasty or a transjugular intrahepatic
porto systemic shunt (TIPSS) may be needed. Anticoagulate (lifelong) unless there are
varices. Consider liver transplant in fulminant hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis.13
George Budd, 1808–1882 (British physician); Hans Chiari, 1851–1916 (Austrian pathologist)
Buerger’s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans.) Non-atherosclerotic smoking-
related infl ammation and thrombosis of veins and middle-sized arteries causing
thrombophlebitis and ischaemia (ulcers, gangrene). Cause: Unknown. Stopping
smoking is vital. Most patients are men aged 20–45yrs (see BOX ‘Poisoning your
boss’). Leo Buerger, 1879–1943 (US physician)
Caplan’s syndrome Multiple lung nodules in coal workers with RA, caused by an in-
fl ammatory reaction to anthracite (also associated with silica or asbestos exposure).
CXR: bilateral perip heral nodules (0.5–5cm).  : TB. Anthony Caplan, 1907–1976 (British physician)
Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome (Peroneal muscular atrophy.) This inherited
neuropathy starts in puberty with weak legs and foot drop + variable loss of sensa-
tion and refl exes. The peroneal muscles atrophy, leading to an inverted champagne
bottle appearance. Atrophy of hand and arm muscles also occurs. The most common
form, CMT1A (PMP22 myelin gene mutation on chr. 17), has AD inheritance. Quality of life
is good; total incapacity rare. Hand pain/paraesthesiae may respond to nerve release.

Churg–Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.) A
triad of adult-onset asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis (± vasospasm ± MI ± DVT),
aff ecting lungs, nerves, heart, and skin. A septic-shock picture/systemic infl amma-
tory response syndrome may occur (with glomerulon eph ritis/renal failure, esp. if
ANCA +ve). : Steroids; biological agents if refractory disease, eg rituximab.14
Jacob Churg, 1910–2005; Lotte Strauss, 1913–1985 (US pathologists)
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) The cause is a prion (PrPSc), a misfolded form of a
normal protein (PrPc), that can transform other proteins into prion proteins (hence its
infectivity). PrPSc leads to spongiform changes (tiny cavities ± tubulovesicular struc-
tures) in the brain.15 Most cases are sporadic (incidence: 1–3/million/yr). Variant CJD
(vCJD; ≈225 cases worldwide)16 is transmitted via con tamin ated CNS tissue aff ected by
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (see BOX ‘Signs that may distinguish variant
CJD’). Inherited forms: (eg Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, P102L mutation
in PRNP gene with ataxia ± self-mutilation), the ‘normal’ protein is too unstable, readily
trans forming to PrPSc. Iatrogenic causes: Cont aminated surgical instruments, corneal
transplants, growth hormone from human pituitaries, and blood (vCJD only).17 Prion
protein resists sterilization. Signs: Progressive dementia, focal CNS signs, myoclonus
(present in 95%),18 depression, eye signs (diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual
disturbances, homonymous fi eld defects, hallucinations, cortical blindn ess).19 Tests:
Tonsil/olfactory mucosa biopsy;20 CSF gel electrophoresis; MRI. Treatment: None proven.
Death occurs in ~6 months in sporadic CJD (a little slower in variant CJD). Prevention:
Regulations to  spread of BSE and transmission to humans +  iatrogenic transmission.

Crigler–Najjar syndrome Two rare syndromes of inherited unconjugated hyper-
bilirubinaemia presenting in the 1st days of life with jaundice ± CNS signs. Cause:
Mutation in UGT enzyme activity causing absent (type 1) or impaired (type 2; mild)
ability to excrete bilirubin. : T1: phototherapy and plasmapheresis to control jaun-
dice; liver transplant before irreversible kernicterus (OHCS p115) develops.21 T2: usually
no  needed. John F Crigler 1919–2002; Victor A Najjar b1914 (US paediatricians)

Signs that may distinguish variant CJD from sporadic CJD (SCJD)
• An earlier age at presentation (median 29yrs vs 60yrs in sporadic CJD).
• Longer survival and later dementia (median 14 months vs 4 for sporadic CJD).
• Psychiatric features are an early sign (anxiety, withdrawal, apathy, agitation, a
permanent look of fear in the eyes, depression, personality change, insomnia).
Hallucinations and delusions may occur—before akinetic mutism.
• Painful sensory symptoms are commoner (eg foot pain hyperaesthesia).
• More normal EEG (sporadic CJD has a characteristic spike and wave pattern).
• Mean CSF tau-pT181/tau protein ratio is 10-fold higher in VCJD than in SCJD.22
• Homozygosity for methionine at codon 129 of the PRP gene is typical.
Fame and infamy in the search for lost youth
After his neurological experiments, Brown-Séquard, the most visionary of all neu-
roanatomists and the grandfather of HRT, proclaimed he had found the secret of
perpetual youth after injecting himself with a concoction of testicular blood, se-
men, and testicular extracts from dogs and guinea pigs. In the 1880s, over 12 000
doctors were queuing up to use his special extracts on patients, which he gave
away free, provided results were reported back to him. 314 out of 405 cases of spi-
nal syphilis improved, and his own urinary fl ow rate rose by 25%. Endocrino logists
never forgave him for bringing their science into disrepute. To this day, no one
really knows if his (literally) seminal work has given us anything of any practical
value. But he might be pleased to know that testosterone is now known to have
the urodynamic benefi ts he anticipated, at least in men with hypogonadism.23
Like many brilliant men, he had a cruel streak, backing clitoridectomy for preven-
t ing blindness and other imaginary complic ations of ‘masturbatory melan cholia’.
Had he not been blinded by 19th-century ideas about female sexuality, could he
have found a marvellous use for his concoctions, for 21st-century ‘hypoa ctive
sexual desire disorder’? Possibly, but only if he relied on placebo responses.24,25
Poisoning your boss
In 1931, Buerger’s disease caused gangrene in the toes of Harvey Cushing (p224)—
the most cantankerous (and greatest) neurosurgeon ever. He had to be wheeled
to the operating theatre to carry on his brilliant art (and to continue terrifying his
assistants).26 He had to retire partially, whereupon his colleagues presented him
with a magnifi cent silver cigarette box, containing 2000 cigarettes (to which he
was addicted)—one for each brain tumour he had removed during his long career,
so verifying the truth that although we owe everything to our teachers, we must
eventually kill them to move out from under their shadow.1
Why bother studying rare diseases? The Liberski imperative...
For centuries, kuru was no bigger than a man’s hand; a cloud barely visible on
our horizon; a rare disease in cannibals beyond the Pacifi c. But meticulous work
on kuru led to knowledge of prion diseases before the 1990s epidemic of VCJD. If
in the 1950s, Gajdusek and Zigas had not been intrigued as to why kuru aff ected
women and children more than men (their strange neural diet was the culprit), the
discovery of vCJD would have been delayed, as no surveillance would have been in
place. Neural tissue might still be in our food chain, with dreadful consequences.
But further than this, the notion of ‘protein-misfolding diseases’2 would have been
delayed by decades. So this is the lesson: let curiosity fl ourish. This is Liberski’s
imperative.27 So now let’s scan our horizon for other intriguing clouds.
1 Der Vogel kämpft sich aus dem Ei. Das Ei ist die Welt. Wer geboren werden will, muss eine Welt
zerstören. The bird struggles out of the egg. The egg is the world. Whoever will be born, must fi rst destroy
a world. (Hermann Hesse. Demian; 1917.)
2 Cystic fi brosis (misfolded CFTR protein), Marfan’s (misfolded fi brillin),28 Fabry (misfolded -galactosidase),
Gaucher’s (misfolded -glucocerebrosidase), retinitis pigmentosa 3 (misfolded rhodopsin); some cancers may
be caused by misfolding of tumour suppressor proteins (von Hippel–Lindau protein).

Devic’s syndrome (Neuromyelitis optica; NMO.) Infl ammatory demyelination caus-
es atta cks of optic neuritis ± myelitis.29 Abnormal CSF (may mimic bacterial meningi-
tis) and serum anti-AQP4 antibody (in 65%) help distinguish it from MS30 (table 15.1).
: IV steroids; plasma exchange. Azathioprine and rituximab31 help prevent relapses.
Prognosis: Variable; complete remission may occur. Eugène Devic, 1858–1930 (French neurologist)
Dressler’s syndrome This develops 2–10wks after an MI, heart surgery (or even
pacemaker insertion). It is thought that myocardial injury stimulates formation of
auto antibodies against heart muscle. Symptoms: Recurrent fever and chest pain
± pleural or pericardial rub (from serositis). Cardiac tamponade may occur, so avoid
anticoagulants. : Aspirin, NSAIDS, or steroids. William Dressler, 1890–1969 (US cardiologist)
Dubin–Johnson syndrome There is defective hepatocyte excretion of conjugated
bilirubin. Typically presents in late teens with intermittent jaundice ± hepatospleno-
megaly (autosomal recessive). Tests: Bilirubin; ALT and AST are normal; bilirubinuria
on dipstick; ratio of urinary coproporphyrin I to III. Liver biopsy: diagnostic pigment
granules.32 : Usually none needed. Isadore N Dubin, 1913–1981; Frank B Johnson, b1919 (US pathologists)
Dupuytren’s contracture (fi g 15.3) Progressive shortening and thickening of the
palmar fascia causing fi nger contracture and loss of extension (often 5th fi nger).
Prevalence: ~10% of  >65yrs ( if +ve family history). Associations: Smoking, alcohol
use, heavy manual labour, trauma, DM, phenytoin, HIV. Peyronie’s may coexist (p708).
It is thought to be caused by local hypoxia. : Collagenase injections.33 Surgery may be
needed. Baron Guillaume Dupuytren, 1777–1835 (French surgeon, famed also for treating Napoleon’s haemorrhoids)
Ekbom’s syndrome (Restless legs.) Criteria: 1 Compelling desire to move legs.
2Worse at night. 3 Relieved by movement. 4 Unpleasant leg sensations (eg shoot-
ings or tinglings) worse at rest. Mechanism: Endogenous opioid system fault causes
altered central processing of pain. Prevalence: 1–3%. :≈2:1. Associations: Iron
defi ciency, uraemia, pregnancy, DM, polyneuropa thy, RA, COPD. Exclude: Cramps, posi-
tional discomfort, and local leg pathology. : Dopamine agonists are commonly used;
also, anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines.34
Karl Axel Ekbom, 1907–1977 (Swedish neurologist)
Fabry disease X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by abnormalities in
the GLA gene, leading to a defi ciency in -galactosidase A. There is accumulation
of glycosphingolipids in skin (angiokeratoma classically in a 'swimming trunk' dis-
tribution), eyes (corneal verticillata), heart (hypertrophy, mitral valve prolapse,
dilated aortic root, arrhythmias, angina), kidneys (renal failure, p320), CNS (stroke)
and nerves (neuropathy/acro paraesthesia). Prior to enzyme replacement, premature
death in the 6th decade was due to CV and renal disease. : Enzyme replacement
therapy with  or  human agalsidase.35 Johannes Fabry, 1860–1930 (German dermatologist)
Fanconi anaemia Autosomal recessive, defective stem cell repair & chromosomal
fragility leads to aplastic anaemia, risk of AML and breast ca (BRCA2), skin pigmenta-
tion, absent radii, short stature, microcephaly, syndactyly, deafness, IQ, hypopituita-
rism, and crypto rchidism. : Stem-cell transplant. Guido Fanconi, 1892–1979 (Swiss paediatrician)
Felty’s syndrome A triad of rheumatoid arthritis + WCC + splenomegaly (±hyper-
splenism, causing anaemia and platelets), recurrent infections, skin ulcers, and lym-
phadenopathy. 95% are Rh factor +ve. Splenectomy may raise the wcc. : DMARDS
(p547) ± rituximab if refractory.36 Augustus Roi Felty, 1895–1964 (US physician)
Fitz-Hugh–C urtis syndrome Liver capsule infl ammation causing RUQ pain due to
transabdominal spread of chlamydial or gonococcal infection, often with PID ± ‘violin-
string’ adhesions. : Antibiotics for PID (+ treat sexual partners) ± laparoscopic divi-
sion of adhesions. Thomas Fitz-Hugh, 1894–1963 (US physician); Arthur H Curtis, 1881–1955 (US gynaecologist)
Foster Kennedy syndrome Optic atrophy of one eye due to optic nerve compression
(most commonly from an olfactory groove meningioma), with papilloedema of the
other eye secondary to ICP. There is also central scotoma and anosmia.
Robert Foster Kennedy, 1884–1952 (British neurologist)
Friedreich’s ataxia Expansions of the trinucleotide repeat GAA in the frataxin gene

nerve damage, so tendon refl exes are paradoxically depressed (diff erential diagnosis
p446). There is also dorsal column degeneration, with loss of positional and vibration
sense. Pes cavus and scoliosis occur. Cardiomyopathy may cause CCF. Typical age at

Froin’s syndrome  CSF protein + xanthochromia with normal cell count—a sign of
blockage in spinal CSF fl ow (eg from a spinal tumour). Georges Froin, 1874–1932 (French physician)
Gardner’s syndrome A dominant variant of familial adenomatous polyposis,
caused by mutations in the APC gene (5q21). There are multiple colon polyps (which
inevitably become malignant; p520),37 benign bone osteomas, epidermal cysts,
dermoid tumours, fi bromas, and neurofi bromas. Fundoscopy reveals black spots
(congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium); this helps pre-symptomatic
detection. Presentation: Can present from 2–70yrs with colonic (eg bloody diar-
rhoea) or extracolonic symptoms. Prophylactic surgery (eg proctocolectomy) is the
only curative treatment. Endoscopic polypectomy with long-term celecoxib therapy
has been used to postpone prophylactic colectomy.38 Eldon J Gardner, 1909–1989 (US physician)
Gélineau’s syndrome (Narcolepsy.) The patient, usually a young man, succumbs
to irresistible attacks of inappropriate sleep ± vivid hypnogogic hallucinations,
cataplexy (sudden hypotonia), and sleep paralysis (paralysis of speech and move-
ment, while fully alert, at sleep onset or on waking). Hypothesis: Mutations lead to
loss of hypothalamic hypocretin-containing neurons, via autoimmune des truction.39
95% are +ve for HLA DR2. : Stimulants (eg methylphenidate) may cause depend-
ence ± psychosis. Modafi nil may be better. SE: anxiety, aggression, dry mouth, eupho-
ria, insomnia, BP, dyskinesia, ALP. Jean-Baptiste-Édouard Gélineau, 1828–1906 (French physician)
Gerstmann’s syndrome A constellation of symptoms suggesting a dominant pari-
etal lesion: fi nger agnosia (inability to identify fi ngers), agraphia (inability to write),
acalculia (inability to calculate), and left–right disorientation.
Josef Gerstmann, 1887–1969 (Austrian neurologist)
Gilbert’s syndrome A common cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to 
UGT-1 activity (the enzyme that conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid). Prevalence:
1–2%; 5–15% have a family history of jaundice. It may go unnoticed for many years
and usually presents in adolescence with intermittent jaundice occuring during illness,
exercise or fasting. Diagnosis: Mild bilirubin; normal FBC and reticulocytes (ie no hae-
molysis). It is a benign condition. Nicolas Augustin Gilbert, 1858–1927 (French physician)
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome Tonic, clonic, dystonic, or phonic tics: jerks, blinks,
sniff s, nods, spitting, stuttering, irrep ressible explosive obscene verbal ejaculations
(coprolalia, in 20%) or gestures (coprophilia, 6%),40 grunts, squeaks, burps, twirlings,
and nipping others ± tantrums. There may be a witty, innovatory, phantasmago-
ric picture, with mimicry (echopraxia), antics, impishness, extravagance, audacity,
dram atizations, surreal associations, uninhibited aff ect, speed, ‘go’, vivid imagery
and memory, and hunger for stimuli. The tic paradox: Tics are voluntary, but often
unwanted: the desire to tic stems from the relief of the odd sensation that builds up
prior to the tic and is relieved by it, ‘like scratching a mosquito bite, tics lead to more
tics’.41 Mean age of onset: 6yrs. :≈4:1. Pathogenesis: Unknown; multiple genetic
loci implicated and neuroanatomical abnormalities reported on MRI. Ass ociations:
Obsessive–compulsive disorder; attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder. : (None
may be wanted.) Ris peridone, haloperidol, or pimozide. Habit-reversal training.42
Deep brain stimulation is rarely indicated, but may help.
Marquis Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette, 1857–1904 (French neurologist)
Goodpasture’s disease (A pulmonary-renal syndrome.) Acute glomerulone-
phritis + lung symptoms (haemopt ysis/diff use pulmonary haemorrhage) caused by
antiglom erular basement mem brane antibodies (binding kidney’s basement mem-
brane and alveolar membrane). Tests: CXR: infi ltrates due to pulmonary haemor-
rhage, often in lower zones. Kidney biopsy: crescentic glomerulonephritis. : Treat
shock. Vigorous immu nosuppressive treatment and plasmapheresis.

Cataplexy is highly specifi c for narcolepsy/Gélineau’s syndrome
Daytime sleepiness has many causes, but if it occurs with cataplexy the diagno-
sis ‘must’ be narcolepsy. Cataplexy is bilateral loss of tone in antigravity muscles
provoked by emotions such as laughter, startle, excitement, or anger. Associated
phenomena include: falls, mouth opening, dysarthria, mutism, and phasic muscle
jerking around the mouth. Most attacks are brief, but injury can occur (eg if sever-
al attacks per day). It is comparable to the atonia of rapid eye movement sleep but
without loss of awareness.  : bradycardia, migraine, atonic/akinetic epilepsy,
delayed sleep phase syndrome, conversion disorder, malingering, and psychosis.
Don’t confuse cataplexy with catalepsy—a waxy fl exibility where involuntary
statue-like postures are eff ortlessly maintained (frozen) despite looking most un-
comfortable.

G uillain–Barré syndrome (Acute infl ammatory demyelinating poly-
neuropathy.)43,44 (table 15.2) Incidence: 1–2/100 000/yr. Signs: A few weeks after an in-
fection a symmetrical ascending muscle weakness starts. Triggers: Campylobacter
jejuni, CMV, mycoplasma, zoster, HIV, EBV, vaccinations. The trigger causes antibodies
which attack nerves. In 40%, no cause is found. It may advance quickly, aff ecting all
limbs at once, and can lead to paralysis. There is a progressive phase of up to 4 weeks,
followed by recovery. Unlike other neuropathies, proximal muscles are more aff ected,
eg trunk, respiratory, and cranial nerves (esp. VII). Pain is common (eg back, limb) but
sensory signs may be absent. Autonomic dysfunction: Sweating, pulse, BP changes,
arrhythmias. Nerve conduction studies: Slow conduction. CSF: Protein (eg >5.5g/L),
normal CSF white cell count. Respiratory involvement (the big danger) requires trans-
fer to ITU. Do forced vital capacity (FVC) 4-hourly. Ventilate sooner rather than
later, eg if FVC <1.5L, PaO2 <10kPa, PaCO2 >6kPa. : IV immunoglobulin 0.4g/kg/24h for
5d. Plasma exchange is good too (?more SE).45 Steroids have no role. Prognosis: Good;
~85% make a complete or near-complete recovery. 10% are unable to walk alone
at 1yr. Complete paralysis is compatible with complete recovery. Mortality: 10%.

Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) A spindle-cell tumour derived from capillary endotheli al
cells, caused by human herpes virus 8 (=Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus
KSHV). It presents as purple papules (½–1cm) or plaques on skin (fi g 15.7) and mucosa
(look in mouth, but any organ). It metastasizes to nodes. There are four types: 1 Clas-
sic, a rare disease of the elderly. 2 Endemic, a disease of children documented prior
to HIV. 3 Iatrogenic KS due to immunosuppression, eg organ transplant recipients.
4 AIDS-associated KS. Usually presents with low CD4 count and can indicate failure
of HAART (p402). However ⅓ presents in HIV with near normal CD4 counts and an
undetectable viral load. Initiation of HAART with rapid immune system constitution
can precipitate KS. Lung KS may present in HI V +ve men and women as dyspnoea and
haemoptysis. Bowel KS may cause nausea, abdominal pain. Rare sites: CNS, larynx,
eye, glands, heart, breast, wounds, or biopsy sites. : Biopsy. : Optimize HAART, local
radiotherapy, surgical excision, intralesional therapy (vincristine, bleomycin), topical
retinoids, interferon alfa, interleukin-12. Current research includes thalidomide, VEGF
monoclonal antibodies, and sirolimus. Moricz Kaposi, 1837–1902 (Hungarian dermatologist)

Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome A triad of port wine stain, varicose veins, and limb
hypertrophy, due to vascular malformation. Usually sporadic (although AD inherit-
ance has been reported).48 Maurice Klippel, 1858–1942; Paul Trénaunay, 1875–1938 (French physicians)
Korsakoff ’s syndrome Hypothalamic damage & cerebral atrophy due to thiamine
(vitamin B1) defi ciency (eg in alcoholics). May accompany Wernicke’s encephalopa-
thy. There is ability to acquire new memories, confabulation (invented memory,
owing to retrograde amnesia), lack of insight & apathy. : See Wernicke’s, p714;
patients rarely recover. Sergei Sergeievich Korsakoff, 1853–1900 (Russian neuropsychiatrist)
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Histiocytosis X.) A group of single- (73%, eg bone) or
multisystem (27%) disorders, with infi ltrating granulomas containing dendritic (Langer-
hans) cells. : ≈1.5:1; at-risk organs are liver, lung, spleen, marrow. Pulmonary disease
presents with pneumothorax or pulmonary hypertension. CXR/CT: nodules and cysts +
honeycombing in upper and middle zones. : Biopsy (skin, lung). : Local excision, ster-
oids, vinblastine ± etoposide if severe.49 OHCS p644. Paul Langerhans, 1847–1888 (German pathologist)
Leriche’s syndrome Absent femoral pulse, claudication/wasting of the buttock, a
pale cold leg, and erectile dysfunction from aorto-iliac occlusive dise ase, eg a saddle
embolus at the aortic bifurcation. Surgery may help. René Leriche, 1879–1955 (French surgeon)
Löffl er’s eosinophilic endocarditis Restrictive cardiomyopathy + eosinophilia
(eg 120 ≈ 109/L). It may be an early stage of tropical endomyocardial fi brosis (and
overlaps with hypereosinophilic syndrome, p330) but is distinct from eosinophilic
leuk aemia. Signs: Heart failure (75%) ± mitral regurgitation (49%) ± heart block. :
Suppress the eosin ophilia (prednisolone ± hydroxycarbamide), and then treat with
anti-heart failure medication. Wilhelm Löffl er, 1887–1972 (Swiss physician)
Löffl er’s syndrome (Pulmonary eosinophilia.) An allergic infi ltration of the lungs
by eosinophils. Allergens include: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola
hep atica, Strongyloides, Ankylostoma, Toxocara, Clonorchis sinensis, sulfonam-
ides, hydralazine, and nitrofurantoin. Often symptomless with incidental CXR (diff use
fan-shaped shadows), or cough, fever, eosinophilia (in ~20%) & larval migrans (p433).
: Eradicate cause. Steroids (if idiopathic). Wilhelm Löffl er, 1887–1972 (Swiss physician)
Lown–Ganong–Levine syndrome A pre-excitation syndrome, similar to Wolf–Par-
kinson–White (WPW, p133), characterized by a short PR interval (<0.12sec), a normal
QRS complex (as opposed to the -waves of WPW), and risk of supraventricular tachy-
cardia (but not AF/fl utter). The cause is not completely understood, but may be due
to paranodal fi bres that bypass all or part of the atrioventricular node. The patient
may complain of intermittent palpitations.50

enzyme with resulting inability to convert glycogen into glucose (eg R50X mutation of
PYGM gene; autosomal recessive). Fatigue & crises of cramps ± hyperthermia. Rhab-
domyolysis/myoglobinuria follow exercise. Tests: CK. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic
(necrosis and atrophy). : Mod erate aerobic exercise helps (by utilizing alternative
fuel substrates).51 Avoid heavy exertion and statins. Sucrose pre-exercise improves
performance, as does a carbohydrate-rich diet. Low-dose creatine and ramipril (only
if D/D ACE phenotype) may be of minimal benefi t.52 Brian McArdle, 1911–2002 (British paediatrician)

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: the darkest hour
In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), surface proteins are missing in
all blood cells due to a somatic mutation in the X-linked PIG-A gene. Cells lack the
glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that binds the surface proteins to cell
membranes. This causes uncontrolled amplifi cation of the complement system
and leads to destruction of the RBC membrane and release of haemoglobin into
the circulation (fi g 15.8). NB: the phenomenom of haemoglobinuria3 is not all that
reliable. A much better test even than a marrow biopsy (right-hand panel, show-
ing a clone of PNH cells) is fl ow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored proteins on
peripheral blood cells. This can determine the size of the PNH clone and type of GPI
defi ciency (complete or partial). : Most benefi t from supportive measures—but
allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure. Eculizumab is a monoclonal
antibody that targets the C5 protein of the complement system. Blockade prevents
activation of the complement distal pathway, reducing haemolysis, stabilizing
haemoglobin, and reducing transfusion requirements.54
Fig 15.8 Urine and blood in PNH. In this 24h urine sample, the darkest hour is before dawn.
Haemolysis occurs throughout the day and night, but the urine concentrated overnight pro-
duces the dramatic change in colour.

Ménétrier’s disease Giant gastric mucosal folds up to 4cm high, in the fundus, with
atrophy of the glands + mucosal thickness + hypoc hlorhydria + protein-losing gastrop-
athy (hence hypoalbuminaemia ± oedema). Causes: CMV, strep, H. pylori. There may
be epigastric pain, vomiting, ± weight. It is pre-malignant. : Treat H. pylori or CMV if
present; give high-dose PPI; if this fails, consider epidermal growth factor blockade with
cetuximab or gastrectomy (eg if intractable symptoms or malignant change). Epider-
mal growth factor receptor blockade with cetuximab is 1st–line treatment.55 Surgery if
intractable symptoms or malignant change. Pierre Eugène Ménétrier, 1859–1935 (French pathologist)
Meyer–Betz syndrome (Paroxysmal myoglobinuria.) Rare idiopathic condition
causing necrosis of exercising muscles. There is muscle pain, weakness, and discol-
oured urine: pinkbrown (as myoglobin is excreted). Acute kidney injury can result
from myoglobinuria (p319). DIC is associated. Tests: WCC, LFT, LDH, CPK, urine

be avoided. Friedrich Meyer-Betz, described 1910 (German physician)
Mikulicz’s syndrome Benign persistent swelling of lacrimal and parotid (or sub-
mandibular) glands due to lymphocytic infi ltration. Exclude other causes (sarcoidosis,
TB, viral infection, lymphoproliferative disorders). It is thought to be an IgG4-related
plasmacytic systemic disease.56 Johann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki, 1850–1905 (Polish–Austrian surgeon)

Münchausen’s syndrome Vivid liars, who are addicted to institutions, fl it from hos-
p ital to hospital, feigning illness, eg hoping for a laparotomy or mastectomy, or they
complain of awful bleeding, odd eye movements, curious fi ts, sexual assaults, throat
closings, false asthma, or heart attacks. Münchausen-by-proxy entails injury to a de-
pendent person by a carer (eg mother) to gain medical attention.

Who was Baron Münchausen?
Baron Karl Münchausen was an 18th-
century German aristocrat and fabulist,
whose tall tales became fi rst a popular
book, then a byword for circular logic,
and fi nally a medical syndrome of self-
delusion. He is famous for riding can-
nonballs, travelling to the moon, and
pulling himself out of a swamp by his
own hair. In emergencies (we’ve all
had that sinking feeling…), this method
may save your life, for example in your
fi nal exams (fi g 15.11):
Examiner: ‘What is ITP?’
You: ‘ITP is idiopathic thrombocyto-
penic purpura.’ (you have scored 50%
already).
Fig 15.11 Münchausen during his fi nals.
Examiner: ‘And what is idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura?’
You: ‘It’s when a cryptogenic cause of a low platelet count leads to purpura.’
You have deployed your skills with logical brilliance, without adding a single in-
sight. For this Münchausen circularity you may be awarded 100%—unless your
examiner is a philosopher, when the right answer would be ‘What is ITP? I don’t
know—and nor do you’—but don’t try this too often. You see, you must never for-
get that medicine is marvellously scientifi c, and no one is popular who dares cast
doubt on this article of faith.

Pott’s syndrome (Spinal TB.) Rare in the West, this is usually from an extra-spinal
source, eg lungs. Features: Backache, and stiff ness of all back movements. Fever,
night sweats, and weight loss occur. Progressive bone destruction leads to vertebral
collapse and gibbus (sharply angled spinal curvature). Abscess formation may lead
to cord compression, causing paraplegia, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (p466). X-
rays: (fi g 15.15) Narrow disc spaces and vertebral osteoporosis, leading to destruc-
tion with wedging of vertebrae. Lesions in the thoracic spine often lead to kyphosis.
Abscess formation in the lumbar spine may track down to the psoas muscle, and
erode through the skin. : Anti-TB drugs (p394). Sir Percival Pott, 1714–1788 (British surgeon)
Prinzmetal (variant) angin a Angina from coronary artery spasm, which may lead
to MI, ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death. Severe chest pain occurs without
physical exertion. Triggers include hyperventilation, cocaine and tobacco use. ECG: ST

(p114) and long-acting nitrates as prophylaxis. Myron Prinzmetal, 1908–1987 (US cardiologist)
Raynaud’s syndrome This is peripheral digital ischaemia due to paroxysmal va-
sospasm, precipitated by cold or emotion. Fingers or toes ache and change colour:
pale (ischaemia) blue (deoxygenation) red (reactive hyperaemia). It may be
idiopathic (Raynaud’s disease—prevalence: 3–20%; : >1:1) or have an underlying
cause (Raynaud’s phenomenon; fi g 15.16). Tests: Exclude an underlying cause (see BOX
‘Conditions in which Raynaud’s phenomenon may be exhibited’). : Keep warm (eg
hand warmers); stop smoking.4 Nifedipine 5–20mg/8h PO helps, as may evening prim-
rose oil, sildenafi l, and epoprostenol (for severe attacks/digital gangrene). Relapse is
common. Chemical or surgical (lumbar or digital) sympathectomy may help in those
with severe disease. AG Maurice Raynaud, 1834–1881 (French physician)

Prinzmetal angina and vascular hyperreactivity
Coronary spasm causes Prinzmetal angina and also contributes to coronary heart
disease in general, eg acute coronary syndrome (esp. in Japan). Coronary spasm
can be induced by ergonovine, acetylcholine, and methacholine (the former is used
diagnostically).5 These cause vasodilation by endothelium-derived nitric oxide
when vascular endothelium is functioning normally, whereas they cause vasocon-
striction if the endothelium is damaged. In the light of these facts, patients with
coronary spasm are thought to have a disturbance in endothelial function as well
as local hyperreactivity of the coronary arteries.
If full anti-anginal therapy does not reduce symptoms, stenting or intrac oronary
radiation (20Gy brachytherapy) to vasospastic segments may be tried. Prognosis
is good (especially if non-smoker, no past MI, and no diabetes; progress to infarc-
tion is quite rare);61 -blockers and large doses of aspirin are contraindicated.
Prinzmetal angina is associated with vascular hyperreactivity/vasospastic dis-
orders such as Raynaud’s phenomenon and migraine. It is also associated with
circle of Willis occlusion from intimal thickening (moyamoya disease).

5 Since Prinzmetal angina is not a ‘demand-induced’ symptom, but a supply (vasospastic) abnormality,
exercise tolerance tests don’t help. The most sensitive and specifi c test is IV ergonovine; 50mcg at 5min
intervals in a specialist lab until a +ve result or 400mcg is given. When positive, the symptoms and ST should
be present. Nitroglycerin rapidly reverses the eff ects of ergonovine if refractory spasm occurs.62

Sjögren’s syndrome A chronic infl ammatory autoimmune disorder, which may be
primary (:≈9:1, onset 4th–5th decade) or secondary, associated with connec-
tive tissue disease (eg RA, SLE, systemic sclerosis). There is lymphocytic infi ltration
and fi brosis of exocrine glands, especially lacrimal and salivary glands. Features:
Tear production (dry eyes, keratoconjunctivitis sicca), salivation (xerostomia—dry
mouth, caries), parotid swelling. Other glands are aff ected causing vaginal dryness,
dyspareunia, dry cough, and dysphagia. Systemic signs include polyarthritis/arthral-
gia, Raynaud’s, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis, lung, liver, and kidney involvement, pe-
ripheral neuropathy, myositis, and fatigue. It is associated with other autoimmune
diseases (eg thyroid disease, autoimmune hepatitis, PBC) and an risk of non-Hodg-
kin’s B-cell lymphoma. Tests: Schirmer’s test measures conjunctival dryness (<5mm
in 5min is +ve). Rose Bengal staining may show keratitis (use a slit-lamp). Anti-Ro
(SSA; in 40%) & anti-La (SSB; in 26%) antibodies may be present (in pregnancy, these
cross the placenta and cause fetal congenital heart block in 5%). ANA is usually +ve
(74%); rheumatoid factor is +ve in 38%. There may be hypergammaglob ulinaemia.
Biopsy shows focal lymphocytic aggregation. : Treat sicca symptoms: eg hypro mel-
lose (artifi cial tears), frequent drinks, sugar-free pastilles/gum. NSAIDS and hydroxy-
chloroquine are used for arthralgia. Immunosuppressants may be indicated in severe
systemic disease.64 Henrik Conrad Samuel Sjögren, 1899–1986 (Swedish ophthalmologist)
Stevens–Johnson syndrome A severe form of erythema multiforme (p562), and a
variant of toxic epidermal necrolysis. It is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction, usu-
ally to drugs (eg salicylates, sulfonamides, penicillin, barbiturates, carbamazepine,
phenytoin), but is also seen with infections or cancer. There is ulceration of the skin
and mucosal surfaces (see fi g 15.18). Typical target lesions develop, often on the
palms or soles with blistering in the centre. There may be a prodromal phase with fe-
ver, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia ± vomiting and diarrhoea. : Mild disease is usually
self-limiting—remove any precipitant and give supportive care (eg calamine lotion
for the skin). Steroid use is controversial—trials have been variable, so ask a derma-
tologist and ophthalmologist. IV immunoglobulin has shown benefi t. Plasmapheresis
and immunosuppressive agents may have a role.65 Prognosis: Mortality ~5%. May be
severe for the fi rst 10d before resolving over 30d. Damage to the eyes may persist
and blindness can result. Albert M Stevens 1884–1945; Frank C Johnson, 1894–1934 (US paediatricians)
Sturge–Weber syndrome (SWS) Essential features: 1 Facial cutaneous capillary
malformation (port wine stain; PWS) in the ophthalmic dermatome (V1 ± V2/V3).
2 Clinical signs or radiologic evidence of a leptomeningeal vascular malformation.
75% of patients with unilateral involvement develop seizures by age 1yr (95% if bilat-
eral)—due (in part) to the increased metabolic demand of a developing brain in the
setting of vascular compromise. Early management of seizures is critical to minimize
brain injury. Some patients have severe cognitive and neurologic defi cits beyond
simple seizure activity. Screen early for glaucoma (50%). EEG and MRI help establish
early diagnosis and treatment in patients at risk for SWS. Treat the PWS early with
pulsed dye laser. William A Sturge, 1850–1919; Frederick P Weber, 1863–1962 (British physicians)

Causes of a long QT interval
Many conditions and drugs (check BNF) cause a long QT interval. Brugada syn-
drome (p695) is similar, predisposing to sudden cardiac death.
Congenital: Romano–Ward syndrome (autosomal dominant). Jervell and Lange-
Nielsen syndrome (autosomal recessive) with associated deafness (p702).
Cardiac: Myocardial infarction or ischaemia; mitral valve prolapse.
HIV: May be a direct eff ect of the virus or from protease inhibitors.
Metabolic: K+; Mg2+; Ca2+; starvation; hypothyroidism; hypothermia.
Toxic: Organophosphates.
Anti-arrhythmic drugs: Quinidine; amiodarone; procainamide; sotalol.
Antimicrobials: Erythromycin; levofl oxacin; pentamidine; halofantrine.
Antihistamines: Terfenadine; astemizole.
Motility drugs: Domperidone.
Psychoactive drugs: Haloperidol; risperidone; tricyclics; SSRIs.
Connective tissue diseases: Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (p552).
Herbalism: Ask about Chinese folk remedies (may contain unknown amounts of
arsenic). Cocaine, quinine, and artemisinins (and other antimalarials) are exam-
ples of herbalism-derived products that can prolong the QT interval.

Takayasu’s arteritis (Aortic arch syndrome; pulseless disease.) Rare outside of
Japan, this systemic vasculitis aff ects the aorta and its major branches. Granuloma-
tous infl ammation causes stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. It often aff ects wom-
en aged 20–40yrs. Symptoms depend on the arteries involved. The aortic arch is often
aff ected, with cerebral, ophthalmological, and upper limb symptoms, eg dizziness,
visual changes, weak arm pulses. Systemic features are common—eg fever, weight
loss, and malaise. BP is often a feature, due to renal artery stenosis. Complications
include aortic valve regurgitation, aortic aneurysm and dissection; ischaemic stroke
(BP and thrombus); and ischaemic heart disease. Diagnosis: ESR and CRP; MRI/PET
allows earlier diagnosis than standard angiography. : Prednisolone (1mg/kg/d PO).
Methotrexate or cyclophosphamide have been used in resistant cases. BP control is
essential to risk of stroke. Angioplasty ± stenting, or bypass surgery is performed for
critical stenosis. Prognosis: ~95% survival at 15 years.
Mikito Takayasu, 1860–1938 (Japanese ophthalmologist)
Tietze’s syndrome (Idiopathic costochondritis.) Localized pain/tenderness at the
costosternal junction, enhanced by motion, coughing, or sneezing. The 2nd rib is most
often aff ected. The diagnostic key is localized tenderness which is marked (fl inches
on prodding). Treatment: Simple analgesia, eg NSAIDS. Its importance is that it is a
benign cause of what at fi rst seems to be alarming, eg cardiac pain. In lengthy ill-
ness, local steroid injections may be used. Alexander Tietze, 1864–1927 (German surgeon)
Todd’s palsy Transient neurological defi cit (paresis) after a seizure. There may be
face, arm, or leg weakness, aphasia, or gaze palsy, lasting from ~30min–36h. The
aetiology is unclear. Robert Bentley Todd, 1809–1860 (Irish-born physician)
Vincent’s angina (Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.) Mouth infection with ulcera-
tive gingivitis from Borrelia vincentii (a spirochaete) + fusiform bacilli, often aff ecting
young  smokers with poor oral hygiene. Try amoxicillin 500mg/8h and metronida-
zole 400mg/8h PO, + chlorhex idine mouthwash. Jean Hyacinthe Vincent, 1862–1950 (French physician)
Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome A dominant germline mutation of a tumour sup-
pressor gene. It predisposes to bilateral renal cysts and clear cell renal carcinoma
(p320), retinal & cerebellar haemangioblastoma, and phaeochromocytoma. See fi gs
15.19, 15.20. It may present with visual impairment or cerebellar signs (eg unilateral
ataxia). Eugen von Hippel, 1867–1939 (German ophthalmologist); Arvid Lindau, 1892–1958 (Swedish pathologist)
Von Willebrand’s disease (VWD) Von Willebrand’s factor (vWF) has three roles in
clotting: 1 To bring platelets into contact with exposed subendothelium. 2 To make
platelets bind to each other. 3 To bind to factor VIII, protecting it from destruction in
the circulation. There are >22 types of vWD; the commonest are:
Type I: (60–80%) Levels of of vWF. Symptoms are mild. Autosomal dominant.
Type II: (20–30%) Abnormal vWF, with lack of high-molecular-weight multimers. Usu-
ally autosomal dominant inheritance. Bleeding tendency varies. There are 4 subtypes.
Type III: (1–5%) Undetectable vWF levels (autosomal recessive with gene deletions).
vWF antigen is lacking and there is factor VIII. Symptoms can be severe.
Signs are of a platelet-type disorder (p344): bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia,
bleeding post-tooth extraction. Tests: APTT, bleeding time, factor VIIIC (clotting
activity), vWF Ag; INR and platelets. : Get expert help. Desmopressin is used in
mild bleeding, vWF-containing factor VIII concentrate for surgery or major bleeds.
Avoid NSAIDS. Erik Adolf von Willebrand, 1870–1949 (Finnish physician)
Wallenberg’s lateral medullary syndrome This relatively common syndrome
comprises lesions to multiple CNS nuclei, caused by posterior or inferior cerebellar
artery occlusion leading to brainstem infarction (fi g 15.21). Features: • Dysphagia,
dys arthria (IX and X nuclei). • Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus (vestibular nu-
cleus). • Ipsilateral ataxia (inferior cerebellar peduncle). • Ipsilateral Horner’s syn-
drome (descending sympathetic fi bres). • Loss of pain and temperature sensation on
the ipsilateral face (V nucleus) and contralateral limbs (spinothalamic tract). There is
no limb weakness as the pyramidal tracts are unaff ected.
In the rarer medial medullary syndrome, vertebral or anterior spinal artery
occlusion causes ipsilateral tongue paralysis (XII nucleus) with contralateral limb
weakness (pyramidal tract, sparing the face) and loss of position sense.
Adolf Wallenberg, 1862–1949 (German neurologist)

Waterhouse–Friderichsen’s (WhF) syndrome Bilateral adrenal cortex haemor-
rhage, often occurring in rapidly deteriorating meningococcal sepsis, alongside
widespread purpura, meningitis, coma, and DIC (fi g 15.22). The meningococcal en-
dotoxin acts as a potent initiator of infl ammatory and coagulation cascades. Other
causes include H. infl uenzae, pneumococcal, streptococcal, and staphylococcal sep-
sis. Adrenal failure causes shock, as normal vascular tone requires cortisol to set
activity of - and -adrenergic receptors, and aldosterone is needed to maintain
extracellular fl uid volume. Treatment: Antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (p822) and hy-
drocortisone 200mg/4h IV for adrenal support. ICU admission.
Rupert Waterhouse, 1873–1958 (British physician); Carl Friderichsen, 1886–1979 (Danish paediatrician)
Weber’s syndrome (Superior alternating hemiplegia.) Ipsilateral oculomotor
nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia, due to infarction of one-half of the mid-
brain, after occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar or posterior cerebral
arteries. Herman David Weber, 1823–1918 (German-born physician whose son described Sturge–Weber syndrome)
Wegener’s granulomatosis This has been renamed granulomatosis with poly-
angiitis (GPA), in part because of concerns over the suitability of Friedrich Wegener,
a member of the Nazi party during WWII, to be the source of an eponym. GPA is a mul-
tisystem disorder of unknown cause characteri zed by necrotizing granulomatous
infl ammation and vasculitis of small and medium vessels. It has a predilection for
the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. Features: Upper airways disease is
common, with nasal obstruction, ulcers, epistaxis, or destruction of the nasal septum
causing a characteristic ‘saddle-nose’ deformity.6 Sinusitis is often a feature. Re-
nal disease causes rapidly progressive glome rulo nephritis with crescent formation,
proteinuria, or haematuria. Pulmonary involvement may cause cough, haemoptysis
(severe if pulmonary haemorrhage), or pleuritis. There may also be skin purpura or
nodules, peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, arthritis/arthralgia, or ocu-
lar involvement, eg keratitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, uveitis. Tests: CANCA
directed against PR3 is most specifi c and raised in the majority of patients (p553).
Some patients express PANCA specifi c for MPO. ESR/CRP. Urinalysis should be per-
formed to look for proteinuria or haematuria. If these are present, consider a renal
biopsy. CXR may show nodules ± fl uff y infi ltrates of pulmonary haemorrhage. CT may
reveal diff use alveolar haemorrhage. Atypical cells from cytology of sputum/BAL
can be confused with bronchial carcinoma.66 Treatment: Depends on the extent of
disease. Severe disease (eg biopsy-proven renal disease) should be treated with cor-
ticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (or rituximab) to induce remission. Azathioprine
and methotrexate are usually used as maintenance. Indications for plasma exchange
include patients presenting with severe renal disease (eg creatinine >500μmol/L) and
those with pulmonary haemorrhage. Co-trimoxazole should be given as prophylaxis
against Pneumocystis jirovecii and staphylococcal colonization.
Friedrich Wegener, 1907–1990 (German pathologist)
Wernicke’s encephalopathy Thiamine (vitamin B1) defi ciency with a classical
triad of 1 confusion 2 ataxia and 3 ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus, lateral rectus, or
conjugate gaze palsies). There is inadequate dietary intake, GI absorption, and
impaired utilization of thiamine resulting in focal areas of brain damage, including
periaqueductal punctate haemorrhages (mechanism unclear). Always consider this
diagnosis in alcoholics: it may also present with memory disturbance, hypotension,
hypothermia, or reduced consciousness.67 Recognized causes: Chronic alcoholism,
eating disorders, malnutrition, prolonged vomiting, eg with chemotherapy, GI malig-
nancy, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Diagnosis: Primarily clinical. Red cell transketo-
lase activity is decreased (rarely done). Treatment: Urgent replacement to prevent
irreversible Korsakoff ’s syndrome (p704). Give thiamine (Pabrinex®), 2 pairs of high-
potency ampoules IV/IM/8h over 30min for 2d, then 1 pair OD for a further 5d. Oral
supplementation (100mg OD) should continue until no longer ‘at risk’ (+ give other B
vitamins). Anaphylaxis is rare. If there is coexisting hypoglycaemia (often the case in
this group of patients), make sure thiamine is given before glucose, as Wernicke’s can
be precipitated by glucose administration to a thiamine-defi cient patient. Prognosis:
Untreated, death occurs in 20%, and Korsakoff ’s psychosis occurs in 85%—a quarter
of whom will require long-term institutional care. Karl Wernicke, 1848–1905 (German neurologist)

Whipple’s disease A rare disease68 featuring GI malabsorption which usually occurs
in middle-aged white males, most commonly in Europe. It is fatal if untreated and is
caused by Tropheryma whippelii, which, combined with defective cell-mediated im-
munity, produces a systemic disease. Features: Often starts insidiously with arthral-
gia (chronic, migratory, seronegative arthropathy aff ecting mainly peripheral joints).
GI symptoms commonly include colicky abdominal pain, weight loss, steatorrhea/
diarrhoea, which leads to malabsorption (p266). Systemic symptoms such as chronic
cough, fever, sweats, lymphadenopathy, and skin hyperpigmentation also occur. Car-
diac involvement may lead to endocarditis, which is typically blood culture negative.
CNS features include a reversible dementia, ophthalmoplegia, and facial myoclonus (if
all together, they are highly suggestive)—also hypothalamic syndrome (hyperphagia,
polydipsia, insomnia). NB: CNS involvement may occur without GI involvement. Tests:
Diagnosis requires a high level of clinical suspicion. Jejunal biopsy shows stunted
villi. There is deposition of macrophages in the lamina propria-containing granules
which stain positive for periodic acid–Schiff (PAS). Similar cells may be found in af-
fected samples, eg CSF, cardiac valve tissue, lymph nodes, synovial fl uid. The bacteria
may be seen within macrophages on electron microscopy. PCR of bacterial RNA can
be performed on serum or tissue. MRI may demonstrate CNS involvement. : Should
include antibiotics which cross the blood–brain barrier. Current recommendations:
IV ceftriaxone (or penicillin+streptomycin) for 2wks then oral co-trimoxazole for 1
year. Shorter courses risk relapse. A rapid improvement in symptoms usually occurs.
George Hoyt Whipple, 1878–1976 (US pathologist)
Zellweger syndrome (Cerebrohepatorenal syndrome.) A rare recessive disorder
characterized by absent peroxisomes (intracellular organelles required for many cel-
lular activities including lipid metabolism). The syndrome has a similar molecular ba-
sis to infantile Refsum’s syndrome, and although more severe, exhibits comparable
biochemical abnormalities (p710). Clinical features include craniofacial abnormali-
ties, severe hypotonia and mental retardation, glaucoma, cataracts, hepatomegaly,
and renal cysts. A number of causative PEX gene mutations have been identifi ed. Life
expectancy is usually a few months only. Hans Zellweger, 1909–1990 (US paediatrician)
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome This is the association of peptic ulcers with a gastrin-
secreting adenoma (gastrinoma). Gastrin excites excessive gastric acid production,
which may produce multiple ulcers in the duodenum and stomach. The adenoma is
usually found in the pancreas, although it may arise in the stomach or duodenum.
Most cases are sporadic; 20% are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type
1 (MEN1, p223). 60% are malignant; metastases are found in local lymph nodes and
the liver. Symptoms: Include abdominal pain and dyspepsia, from the ulcer(s), and
chronic diarrhoea due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes (also causes steator-
rhoea) and damage to intestinal mucosa. Incidence: ~0.1% of patients with peptic
ulcer disease. Suspect in those with multiple peptic ulcers, ulcers distal to the duo-
denum, or a family history of peptic ulcers (or of islet cell, pituitary, or parathyroid
adenomas). Tests: (fi g 15.23) Fasting serum gastrin level (>1000pg/mL). Measure
three fasting levels on diff erent days. Hypoc hlorhydria (reduced acid production, eg
in chronic atrophic gastritis) should be excluded as this also causes a raised gastrin
level: gastric pH should be <2. The secretin stimulation test is useful in suspected
cases with only mildly raised gastrin levels (100–1000pg/mL). The adenoma is often
small and diffi cult to image; a combination of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy,
endoscopic ultrasound, and CT is used to localize and stage the adenoma. OGD evalu-
ates gastric/duodenal ulceration. : High-dose proton pump inhibitors, eg omepra-
zole: start with 60mg/d and adjust according to response. Measuring intragastric pH
helps determine the best dose (aim to keep pH at 2–7). All gastrinomas have malig-
nant potential—and surgery is better sooner than later (with lymph node clearance
generally recommended if >2cm in size). Surgery may be avoided in MEN1, as adeno-
mas are often multiple, and metastatic disease is rare. If well-diff erentiated (G1 and
G2) somatostatin analogues may be 1st-line and chemotherapy with streptozotocin
(if available) + doxorubicin/5-FU is 2nd-line. In G3, etoposide + cisplatin is possible.69
Selective embolization may be done for hepatic metastases. Prognosis: 5yr survival:
80% if single resectable lesion, ~20% with hepatic metastases. Screen all patients
for MEN1. Robert M Zollinger, 1903–1992; Edwin H Ellison, 1918–1970 (US surgeons)

Epilogue
25% of patients with rare diseases have to wait from 5–30 years for a diagnosis.
40% are misdiagnosed resulting in inappropriate drugs or psychological treat-
ments—eg 20% of people with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (p149) had to consult
over 20 doctors before the diagnosis was made,70 causing understandable loss of
confi dence in our profession. Lack of appropriate referral and rejection because
of disease complexity are common problems. Let us cultivate our networks with
each other and approach ‘unexplained symptoms’ with an open mind.

Typical eff ective doses
The eff ective dose of an examination is calculated as the weighted sum of the
doses to diff erent body tissues. The weighting factor for each tissue depends on
its sensitivity. The eff ective dose thus provides a single dose estimate related to
the total radiation risk, no matter how the radiation dose is distributed around the
body. This table is certainly not to be learnt; rather it serves as a reminder of the
relative exposures to radiation that we prescribe in practice. Remember that US
and MRI involve no radiation, would they provide the answer?

Justifying exposure to ionizing radiation
The very nature of ionizing radiation that gives us vision into the human body also
gives it lethal properties. In considering the decision to expose patients to radia-
tion, the clinical benefi ts should outweigh the risks of genetic mutation and cancer
induction. These risks can be hard to quantify (and estimates vary wildly—extrapo-
lation of eff ects from doses associated with nuclear explosions are likely unreli-
able) but even with strict guidelines we still have a tendency to over-exposure in
medical practice. Perhaps the best advice is to be certain of the importance of
every dose of radiation that you sanction, and mindful of the comparative doses
involved (see table 16.1).
The responsibility lies with us not to rely too heavily on radiology. Don’t request
examinations to comfort patients (or appease their consultants), to replace im-
ages already acquired elsewhere (or lost) simply to avoid medico-legal issues, or
when the result will not aff ect management. To give an idea of relative doses, a
CT of the abdomen and pelvis gives a typical eff ective dose of 500 times as much
radiation as a CXR. This important factor also tells us about the preference of
ultrasound over CT when investigating abdominal and pelvic complaints such as
acute appendicitis, especially given the youthful demographics of this diagnosis.
Unwitting exposure of the unborn fetus to radiation is inexcusable at any stage
of gestation—unless the mother’s life is in immediate danger—and it is the respon-
sibility of the referring clinician, as well as the radiographer and the radiologist, to
ensure that this is avoided.

The art of the request
One of the most nerve-wracking moments that you can encounter as a recently
qualifi ed doctor is having to request an investigation from a seasoned consultant
radiologist. What information do you need to give? How much? Who do you ask?
Put yourself on the other side: what does the radiologist need to know to decide who
needs what imaging and when? Keep the following in mind when requesting (never
ordering!) an investigation:
Patient details Get the patient’s name right! Include hospital number and date of
birth on all requests.
Clinical details Think of your clinical question, what answer are you hoping radiol-
ogy will provide? It can:
• Confi rm a suspected diagnosis.
• ‘Exclude’ something important (though remember that exclusion is never 100%).
• Defi ne the extent of a disease.
• Monitor the progress of a disease.
 Don’t forget to mention pertinent facts that may change the way the investigation
is carried out: an agitated or confused patient may need sedation prior to an MRI
of their head. A CT scan on a patient with an acutely raised creatinine may need to
be done without contrast medium. Insertion of a drain on a patient with deranged
clotting may need to wait while this is corrected. Include recent creatinine, Hb, and
clotting on the form if appropriate. Don’t forget to mention anticoagulants, eg war-
farin, LMWH, and aspirin for intervention requests.
Investigation details What scan do you think is required, and how soon do you
need it? Diff erent clinical questions require diff erent procedures. If you think the
patient has a collection, would you like them to drain it? Always state whether in-
tervention is required (eg US abdo ± drain insertion). Remember that the radiologist
ultimately decides what imaging or procedure they undertake based on the informa-
tion you have provided.
Tips
• Know your patient well, but keep your request brief and accurate.
• Know the clinical question and how the answer will change your management.
• Look up previous imaging before you go; asking for a CT on a patient who had one
yesterday makes you look foolish and will not go down well.
• If in doubt, or if the investigation is very urgent, go down to the department in per-
son. Regard this as an important opportunity: involving a radiologist will result in
the best selection of imaging technique for your clinical question, will help expedite
urgent requests, and should be of educational value for you.
If your request is turned down Don’t be afraid to (politely) ask why. If you or
your team still feel it is warranted, look back at the request; did you miss a relevant
piece of information that would change the mind of the radiologist? If you still draw
a blank, try speaking to a radiologist who specializes in that particular technique.
Many teams have clinical radiology meetings; think about approaching someone
who appreciates why you are asking that particular question. Alternatively, go back
to your team; speak to your senior, who may have a better understanding of why the
investigation is needed and be able to convey this to the radiologist.
Remember that there is a patient at the heart of this, and you are their advocate.
If the results of an investigation will change their management then explain this to
the radiologist. Moreover, don’t forget to explain it to your patient. Being whisked off
to the department for investigation and intervention can be particularly terrifying
if you aren’t expecting it.

Interpreting an image
You won’t always be able to get an immediate radiologist’s interpretation so it is
important to know how to review an image. First make sure the image you are
looking at is of your patient. Check its date. And remember:
• Practice makes perfect—always look at the image before checking the report,
learning how to distinguish normal from abnormal.
• Understand how the scan is done—this makes interpretation easier and helps
you appreciate which scan will give the answer you need. It also gives practical
clues to the result—eg a routine CXR is performed in the postero-anterior (PA)
direction (the source posterior to the patient to minimize the cardiac shadow).
• Use a systematic approach—so that you don’t miss subtleties.
• Understand your anatomy—virtually all investigations yield a 2D image from a
3D structure. An understanding of anatomical relationships of the area in ques-
tion will help reconstruct the images in your mind.
• Orientation—for axial cross-sectional imaging this is as if you are looking up at
the supine patient from the feet. For images with non-conventional orienta-
tions (eg MRCP) look on the image for clue markings, or rely on your knowledge of
anatomy—it can be tricky to visualize oblique sections!
• Remember the patient—an investigation is only one part of the clinical work-up,
don’t rely solely on the investigation result for your management decisions. Go
back to see the patient after looking at the investigation and reading the radiolo-
gist’s report: you might notice something that you didn’t before.
Presenting an image
Everyone has their own method for presenting, and the right way is your own
way. As long as you cover everything systematically—because we all get ‘hot-seat
amnesia’ at some point—the particulars will take care of themselves. Continue
to polish your own method and remember a few extra tips for when an image is
presented expectantly by your consultant/examiner and the fl oor is yours. A brief
silence with a thoughtful expression as you analyse the image is fi ne, then:
• State the written details: name, date of birth, where and how the imaging was
taken. Look for clues: weighting of an MRI, a ‘+ c’ indicating that contrast medium
has been used, the phase of the investigation (arterial/venous/portal), or even
the name of the organ printed on an ultrasound.
• State the type, mode, and technical quality of investigation—not always easy!
Going through this list also gives you a bit of thinking time. Then:
• Start with life-threatening or very obvious abnormalities. Then be systematic:
• Is the patient’s position adequate? Any lines, leads, or tubes? Note their position.
• Just like the bedside clues in a physical examination, there are clues in radiology
examinations. Note oxygen masks, ECG leads, venous access, infusion apparatus,
and invasive devices. Identifying what they are also helps you to look through
what may otherwise appear to be a cluttered mess.
• Note any abnormalities and try to contextualize these with whatever you al-
ready know of the patient. The abnormality may be hiding in plain sight, but if
struggling, step back and note any asymmetry or areas that just ‘look diff erent’.
• With cross-sectional imaging, scan through adjacent sections noting the anato-
my of one organ system or structure at a time (this may mean going up and down
through a CT abdomen multiple times).
• Giving a diff erential diagnosis is good practice, as not all fi ndings are diagnostic.
• If there is additional clinical information that would help you to make a diagno-
sis, don’t be afraid to ask. After all, we treat patients and not images!
Remember: •X-ray=radiodensity (lucency/opacity). •CT=attenuation.
•US=echogenicity. •MRI=signal intensity.

Chest X-ray—part 1
Images are usually taken on inspiration with the X-ray source behind the patient
(postero-anterior, PA). Mobile images may be antero-posterior (AP, fi g 16.6), magnify-
ing heart size. If supine, distribution of air and fl uid in lungs and pleural cavities is
altered and the diaphragm is elevated.
Acclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memo-
rably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and ‘water’/soft tissue. Each
has its own radiographic density. A border is only seen at an interface of two
densities, eg heart (soft tissue) and lung (air); this ‘silhouette’ is lost if air in the lung
is replaced by consolidation (‘water’). The silhouette sign localizes pathology (eg
middle lobe pneumonia or collapse causing loss of clarity of the right heart border,
fi g 16.2). When interpreting a CXR use a systematic approach that works for you, eg:
Technical quality
• Rotation: The sternal ends of the clavicles should symmetrically overlie the trans-
verse processes of the 4th or 5th thoracic vertebrae. A rotated image can alter the
position of structures, eg rotation to the right projects the aortic arch vessels over
the right upper zone, appearing as though there is a mass.
• Inspiration: There should be 5 to 7 ribs visible anteriorly (or 10 posteriorly). Hy-
perinfl ation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as
the heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding
of vessels at the lung bases can mimic consolidation or collapse. This is common
in patients who are acutely unwell, particularly those in pain or unconscious. Take
care in interpreting these images.
• Exposure: An under-exposed image will be too white and an over-exposed image
will be too black. Both cause a loss of defi nition and quality although some com-
pensation can be made with standard viewing software.
• Position: The entire lung margin should be visible.
Trachea Normally central or just to the right. Deviated by collapse (towards the le-
sion), expansion (away from the lesion), or patient rotation.
Mediastinum May be: Widened by mediastinal fat; retrosternal thyroid; aortic
aneurysm/unfolding; lymph node enlargement (sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastases,
TB); tumour (thymoma, teratoma); cysts (bronchogenic, pericardial); paravertebral
mass (TB). Shifted towards a collapsed lung or away from processes that add vol-
ume (eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax).
There are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum
that help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to inferior they are: 1 Aortic
knuckle. 2 Pulmonary outfl ow tract. 3 Left ventricle.
Hila The left hilum is higher than the right or at the same level (not lower); they
should be the same size and density. The hila may be: Pulled up or down by fi brosis
or collapse. Enlarged by: pulmonary arterial hypertension; bronchogenic ca; lymph
nodes. Sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma can give bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
Calcifi ed due to: sarcoid, past TB; silicosis; histoplasmosis (p408).
Heart Normally less than half of the width of the thorax (cardiothoracic ratio <0.5). ⅓
should lie to the right of the vertebral column, ⅔ to the left. It may appear elongated
if the chest is hyperinfl ated (COPD); or enlarged if the image is AP or if there is LV
failure (fi g 16.3), or a pericardial eff usion. Are there calcifi ed valves?
Diaphragm The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised
hemidiaphragm: Trouble above the diaphragm—lung volume loss or infl ammation.
Trouble with the diaphragm—stroke; phrenic nerve palsy (causes, p504; any medias-
tinal mass?). Trouble below the diaphragm—hepatomegaly; subphrenic abscess. NB:
subpulmonic eff usion (eff usions having a similar contour to the diaphragm without
a characteristic meniscus) and diaphragm rupture give apparent elevation. NB: bilat-
eral palsies (polio, muscular dystrophy) cause hypoxia.

Chest X-ray—part 2: the lungs
The apex of the lower lobe rises up to the 4th rib posteriorly, so it is diffi cult to as-
cribe the true location of a lobe on a PA image without additional information from a
lateral view. It may therefore be better to use the term ‘zone’ rather than lobe when
localizing a lesion.
Opacifi cation Lung opacities are described as nodular, reticular (network of fi ne
lines, interstitial), or alveolar (fl uff y). A single nodule may be called a space-occupying
lesion (SOL).
Nodules: (If >3cm across, the term pulmonary mass is used instead.)
• Neoplasia: metastases (often missed if small), lung cancer, hamartoma, adenoma.
• Infections: varicella pneumonia, septic emboli, abscess (eg as an SOL), hydatid.
• Granulomas: miliary TB, sarcoidosis (see GPA, p714), histoplasmosis.
• Pneumoconioses (except asbestosis), Caplan’s syndrome (p696).
Reticular opacifi cation: =Lung parenchymal changes.
• Acute interstitial oedema.
• Infection: acute (viral, bacterial), chronic (TB, histoplasmosis).
• Fibrosis: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specifi c interstitial pneumonia
(NSIP), drugs (eg methotrexate, bleomycin, crack cocaine), connective tissue dis-
orders (rheumatoid arthritis—p546, GPA—p714, SLE, PAN, systemic sclerosis—p552,
sarcoidosis), industrial lung diseases (silicosis, asbestosis).
• Malignancy (lymphangitis carcinomatosa).
Alveolar opacifi cation: = Airspace opacifi cation, can be due to any material fi lling
the alveoli:
• Pus—pneumonia.
• Blood—haemorrhage, DIC (p352).
• Water—heart, renal, or liver failure (p302, p274), ARDS (p186), smoke inhalation
(p847), drugs (heroin), O
2
toxicity, near drowning (OHCS p768).
• Cells—lymphoma, adenocarcinoma.
• Protein—alveolar proteinosis, ARDS, fat emboli (~7d post fracture).
‘Ring’ opacities: Either airways seen end-on (bronchitis; bronchiectasis) or cavitat-
ing lesions, eg abscess (bacterial, fungal, amoebic), tumour, or pulmonary infarct
(wedge-shaped with a pleural base).
Linear opacities: Septal lines (Kerley B lines, ie interlobular lymphatics seen with
fl uid, tumour, or dusts); atelectasis; pleural plaques (asbestos exposure).
White-out of whole hemithorax: (fi g 16.4) Pneumonia, large pleural eff usion, ARDS,
post-pneumonectomy.
Gas outside the lungs Check for a pneumothorax (hard to spot if apical or in a
supine image, can you see vascular markings right out to the periphery?), surgical
emphysema (trauma, iatrogenic), and gas under the diaphragm (surgery, perforated
viscus, trauma). Pneumomediastinum: Air tracks along mediastinum, into the neck.
Due to rupture of alveolar wall (eg asthma or pulmonary barotrauma) or bronchial
or oesophageal trauma (can be iatrogenic, eg from endoscope). Pneumopericar-
dium: Rare (usually iatrogenic).
Bones Check the clavicles for fracture, ribs for fractures and lesions (eg metasta-
ses), vertebral column for degenerative disease, collapse, or destruction, and shoul-
ders for dislocation, fracture, and arthritis.
An apparently normal CXR? Check for tracheal compression, absent breast shad-
ow (mastectomy), double left heart border (left lower lobe collapse, fi g 16.5), fl uid
level behind the heart (hiatus hernia, achalasia), and paravertebral abscess (TB).

Chest X-ray—part 3
Confi rming the position of various tubes, lines, and leads on a CXR can be a daunting
task, as incorrect positioning can have deadly consequences: an NG tube which is
misplaced can cause aspiration pneumonia, or a poorly positioned CVC can lead to
fatal arrhythmias. However, this can be a straightforward task if you recall some
basic anatomy (fi gs 16.6, 16.7; table 16.2).
If you are unsure, always ask a senior.
Table 16.2 Radiological confi rmation of device placement
Line/tube/lead Correct position for tip(s)
CVC (p774) In the SVC or brachiocephalic vein
PICC In the SVC or brachiocephalic vein
Tunnelled line, eg Hickman At the junction of the SVC and right atrium
Endotracheal 3–7 cm above the carina (in adult)
Nasogastric (p759) 10cm beyond the gastro-oesophageal junction
Chest drain (p766) In the pleural space tracking either up (for pneumothorax)
or down (for eff usion)
Cardiac pacemaker/tempo- Atrial lead—in the right appendage
rary pacing wire (p776) Ventricular lead—in the apex of the right ventricle
Normal anatomy
• The SVC begins at the right 1st anterior intercostal space.
• The right atrium lies at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.
• The carina should be visible at the level of T5–T7 thoracic vertebrae.
• The right atrial appendage sits at the level of the 3rd intercostal space.
Common bleeps from nursing staff
1 Central line not aspirating:
• Is the tip in the right place (see earlier in topic) or has it gone up into the inter-
nal jugular, too far in (sitting against the tricuspid valve, does the patient have
an arrhythmia?) or not far enough in (sitting against a venous valve)?
• Is the tip kinked, suggesting it may be in a side vessel or against the vessel wall?
• If the line looks appropriately positioned, consider fl ushing gently, could the
line be blocked?
2 Patient not ventilating well:
• Is the ET tube down the right main bronchus (causes left lung collapse, or rarely
right pneumothorax)? Retract tube to correct position (see earlier in topic).
• Is the ET tube blocked? Most have a secondary port allowing ventilation even if
the main hole is blocked, get anaesthetic assistance!
3 Chest drain not bubbling/swinging:
• Is it correctly positioned (see earlier in topic)—if not in the pleural space, it
cannot drain the air/fl uid. Common problems include sitting in the soft tissue
of the chest wall, or sitting above the eff usion, below the pneumothorax, or in
the oblique fi ssure.
• Is it blocked? If draining an eff usion and correctly positioned, consider gently
fl ushing with 10mL of sterile saline, then aspirating. If not successful, obtain
senior advice.
• Has the eff usion/pneumothorax resolved? Pneumothoraces can rapidly resolve
with a correctly positioned drain.
4 Unable to aspirate from NG tube:
• Is NG tube not far enough in/coiled in oesophagus? Tip is radio-opaque and
should be visible below the diaphragm, if it is coiled it may lie in the pharynx or
anywhere along the mediastinum.
• Is NG tube passing down the trachea and into the bronchus? The oesophagus is
(generally speaking) a straight vertical line, if the tube veers off to left or right
before it goes below the diaphragm, assume it is in the bronchus and replace it.

chest. Image courtesy of Dr Elen Thomson, Leeds Teaching Hospitals.
Fig 16.7 Knowing where lines and tubes should be placed is an essential skill. An ET tube (orange)
should sit 3–7cm above the carina; this one is slightly high. The tip of the CVC (red, here a right
internal jugular line) should lie in the SVC, as seen here, or just in the right atrium. The tip of the NG
tube (green) must be seen below the diaphragm to ensure it is placed in the oesophagus, not the
trachea. Do not confuse external leads (blue) with internal lines.

Plain abdominal x-ray
These are rarely diagnostic and involve a radiation dose equivalent to 50 CXRS. Indica-
tions for AXR with acute abdominal symptoms:
• Suspicion of obstruction (or intussusception, eg in paediatrics).
• Acute fl are of infl ammatory bowel disease (eg to confi rm/exclude megacolon).
• Renal colic with known renal stones (if fi rst presentation, CT KUB is better).
• Ingestion of a sharp or poisonous foreign body (eg lithium battery).
Bowel gas pattern is best assessed on supine images and free intraperitoneal gas
(signifying perforation) is best seen on an erect CXR (fi g 13.26, p607).
Gas patterns Look for: an abnormal quantity of gas in the stomach, small intestine,
or colon. Decide whether you are looking at small or large bowel (fi g 16.8; table 16.3).
Small bowel diameter is normally ~2.5cm, the colon ~5cm, the caecum up to 10cm. Di-
lated small bowel is seen in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Dilated large bowel (6cm)
is seen in both these, and also in ‘toxic dilatation’, and, in the elderly, in benign hypoto-
nicity. Grossly dilated segments of bowel (coff ee bean sign) are seen in sigmoid and
caecal volvulae—fi g 13.28c, p611. Loss of normal mucosal folds and bowel wall thicken-
ing are seen in infl ammatory colitis (eg IBD)—fi g 16.9. ‘Thumb-printing’ is protrusion of
thickened mural folds into the lumen, seen in large bowel ischaemia and colitis.
Table 16.3 Radiological gas patterns in the bowel
Small bowel Large bowel Ileus
• Smaller calibre • Larger calibre • Both small and
• Central; multiple loops • Peripheral large bowel visible
• Valvuli conniventes: • Semi-lunar folds:* don’t go • There is no clear
folds that go from wall to wall, all all the way across the lu- transition point
the way across the lumen; more men, but may appear to do that corresponds
regular and fi ner than haustra so if viewed from an angle to an obstructing
lesion
• Grey (contains air and fl uid) • Blacker (contains gas)†
*Semi-lunar folds (plicae semilunares) lie in between adjacent haustra.
†The ascending colon contains liquid faeces, but the descending colon contains faecal pellets (scybala).
Gas outside the lumen You must explain any gas outside the lumen of the gut. It
could be: 1 Pneumoperitoneum; signs on the supine AXR include: gas on both sides of
the bowel wall (Rigler’s sign), a triangle of gas in the RUQ trapped beneath the falci-
form ligament, and a circle of gas beneath the anterior abdominal wall. Seen with
bowel perforation but also after laparoscopic surgery. 2 Gas in the urinary tract—eg
in the bladder from a fi stula. 3 Gas in the biliary tree (see next paragraph), or rarely
4 Intramural gas, found in bowel necrosis.
Biliary tree Any stones: ~10% visible on plain AXR. Any gas: (Pneumobilia.) Caused
by: •post-ERCP/sphincterotomy •post-surgery (eg Whipple’s) •recent stone passage
•anaerobic cholangitis (rare) •gallbladder–bowel fi stula: gallstone migrates directly
into the bowel (Rigler’s triad is seen in 25%: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction,
an ectopic gallstone). Calcifi cation: (‘Porcelain gallbladder’.) Chronic infl ammation
from gallstones (associated with gallbladder cancer).
Urinary tract Check for calculi (visible in 90% of cases)1 and normal anatomy: Kidneys:
Length equivalent to 2½–3½ vertebral bodies, slope inferolaterally. Right is lower than
the left (‘pushed down’ by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding
layer of perinephric fat. Ureters: Pass near the tips of the lumbar transverse processes,
cross the sacroiliac joints, down to the ischial spines, and turn medially to join the bladder.
Other soft tissues Look for size/position of: liver, spleen, and bladder. A big liver
will push bowel to the left side of the abdomen. An enlarged spleen displaces bowel
and stomach bubble to the right. A big bladder elevates these.
Medical devices Double-J and biliary stents, nephrostomy and gastrostomy tubes,
intrauterine devices, laparoscopic clips, and peritoneal dialysis catheters can be seen.
Bones and joints Plain AXR is not ideal, but there may be important abnormalities.
In the lumbar spine, look for scoliosis and degeneration (osteophytes, joint space
narrowing) as well as bone metastases or sacroiliitis.
1 Don’t get confused by other calcifi cations—eg phleboliths: harmless calcifi cations found in the perivesical
veins (rounded with a radiolucent centre).

Computed tomography (CT)
Can give whole-body images in under one breath (thanks to continuous, helical data
acquisition). Within a single slice (eg 0.5 or 5mm thick), CT records the attenuation
(=loss of energy from, eg absorption or refl ection) of diff erent tissues to ionizing ra-
diation and calculates a mean value for a given volume of tissue (a ‘voxel’). This value
is represented in greyscale as a single point, called a pixel, in the fi nal 2D image (or 3D
‘reconstruction’—fi g 16.13). The greyscale of the pixel is measured on the Hounsfi eld
scale (see fi g 16.10) relative to the attenuation of water, 0 Hounsfi eld units (HU), and
air, Ω1000HU. The human eye and display systems have a limited greyscale range, so
diff erent settings (levels and ‘windows’) are used to focus on diff erences in attenuation
in ranges typical for tissues of diff erent density, eg bone or lung (fi g 16.11).
CTS are responsible for up to 40% of iatrogenic radiation in high-use settings, which
could account for ~1% of all cancers: always balance benefi ts of CT vs other modali-
ties with less or no radiation (ultrasound; MRI), particularly in the young or in those
with chronic disease likely to undergo multiple imaging investigations. Discuss with
a radiologist—there are several technical aspects of imaging that can limit radiation
dose whilst still providing clinically useful information.
Imaging of choice for
• Staging and monitoring most malignant disease.
• Intracranial pathology, eg stroke, trauma, ICP, and space-occupying lesions.
• Trauma.
• Pre-operative assessment of complex masses.
• Assessment of acute abdomen (fi gs 16.15, 16.16). NB ultrasound increasingly used
(p736).
• Following abdominal surgery.
Contrast medium (p748) Enhance anatomical detail by use of a high- or low
(water)-attenuating medium to fi ll the lumen of a structure. Give IV to image vascu-
lar anatomy (fi g 16.12) and vascular structures (including highly perfused tumours).
Images acquired at diff erent times (‘phases’) after injection will show the agent in
arterial or venous structures or during ‘washout’ (=clearing). Perfusion CT maps
cerebral blood fl ow by acquiring serial images after contrast administration then
combines these into a colour-coded image of perfusion times (fi g 16.14). Ensure IV
cannulae secure and suffi cient gauge to allow for rapid injection of agent as bolus—
extravasation of contrast can cause signifi cant tissue damage. Give PO eg 1–12h before
imaging bowel. Give PR for examining distal colonic lumen.
Contrast-enhanced CTS may include a pre-contrast series. Unenhanced imaging
alone reduces radiation exposure and may be adequate for images of the brain, spine,
lung, and musculoskeletal system or necessary in those with renal failure (contrast is
nephrotoxic).
Streak artefact Remember that the CT slice image is a matrix representation of
the attenuation produced by rotating around the patient. High-attenuation items
such as metal fi llings, clips, and prostheses (and even bone) can cause interference.
CT combined with PET (See p739.) Combines the anatomical detail of CT with the
metabolic information of PET, to aid assessment of, eg neoplastic lesions. Radiation
doses are much higher than CT alone.

CT images of two patients with acute abdominal pain
Fig 16.15 The history was of central abdominal pain with a non-peritonitic abdomen. The
CT shows a leaking AAA. Under fl uoroscopic screening, this can be repaired using stents,
inserted via femoral arterial puncture and deployed in the aneurysm (p654). This kind of
endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is commonly used in the treatment of leaking AAA
as well as elective repair of intact but enlarging aneurysms.
The changing roles of surgeons and CT in the acutely unwell
In the days when general surgeons did their rounds towards the end of an on-call
day, there would be wards of patients with undiagnosed abdominal pain having
‘drip-and-suck’ regimens (IVI and NGT) while awaiting improvement or a change
in their clinical condition that revealed the need for surgery. On opening up, the
surgeon would try to deal with whatever pathology was found. With increased
subspecialization and accurate emergency imaging (CT and US), patients are now
matched to a team best equipped to deal with their condition. In this context,
drip-and-suck is on the ebb, giving way to imaging, early intervention, rapid dis-
charge, or onward referral. With increasing pressures to safeguard surgical beds
for elective cases and on junior surgeons to polish their surgical logbooks in de-
creased training hours, can come attempts to defl ect away from surgical teams
the care of patients in whom imaging or clinical circumstances suggest no current
requirement for an operation. But is this always appropriate? Do we expect on-call
surgeons to be practitioners of medicine, assessing and managing patients with
surgical pathology, even if a trip to the operating theatre is not currently called for,
or simply technicians restricted to cutting?

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
1 A large proportion of the human body is fat or water (~80%).
2 Fat and water contain a large number of hydrogen nuclei (unpaired protons).
3 The spin of a positively charged hydrogen nucleus gives it magnetic polarity.
Thus…
• Placing the human body in a magnetic fi eld aligns its hydrogen nuclei either with
(parallel) or against (anti-parallel) the fi eld.
• A radiofrequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency fl ips a few nuclei away from
their original alignment by an angle depending on the amount of energy they absorb.
• When the RF pulse stops, the nuclei fl ip back (or relax) into their original alignment,
emitting the energy (called an echo) that was absorbed from the RF pulse.
• Measuring and plotting the energy of the returning signal according to location
(provided the nuclei haven’t moved) gives a picture of fat, tissue, and water as
distributed throughout the body.
• The hydrogen nuclei in fl owing blood move after receiving the RF pulses. The echo is
not detected, and so the vessel lumen appears black (fl ow void).
Rather than radiodensity or attenuation, the correct descriptive terminology for the
greyscale seen in MRI is signal intensity: high signal appears white and low signal black
(see table 16.4). Weighting is a quality of MRI that is dependent on the time between
the RF pulses (repetition time, TR) and the time between an RF pulse and the echo (echo
time, TE). MR images are most commonly T1-weighted (good for visualizing anatomy)
or T2-weighted (good for visualizing disease) but can also be a mixture of both, called
proton density (PD) weighting. FLAIR sequences produce heavily T2-weighted images.
A good way to determine the weighting of an MR image is to look for water—eg in the
aqueous humour of the eye, CSF, or synovial fl uid (see table 16.4; fi g 16.17).

excellent for imaging soft tissues (water- and hence proton-dense) and is preferred
over CT for musculoskeletal disorders and for many intracranial, head, and neck pa-
thologies (fi gs 16.18–16.20). Multiplanar acquisition of images can provide multiple
views and 3D reconstruction from one scan. MR angiography is also excellent for
reconstructing vascular anatomy. This avoids the need for invasive angiography with
femoral puncture or CT contrast in patients with renal impairment.
Disadvantages Long acquisition times. Poor imaging of lung parenchyma. Claustro-
phobic. Incompatible with some metal implants. High cost and specialized interpre-
tation (=limited availability).
Contraindications Absolute: •Pacemakers; other implanted electrical devices.
•Metallic foreign bodies, eg intra-ocular (consider orbital X-ray to exclude), shrapnel.
•Non-compatible surgical clips/coils/heart valves. Relative: •If unable to complete
the pre-scan questionnaire. •Cochlear implants. NB: orthopaedic prostheses and ex-
tracranial metallic clips are generally safe. If uncertain, ask a radiologist. Contrast:

Ultrasound (US)
Unlike the other methods of imaging, US doesn’t use electromagnetic radiation. In-
stead, it relies on properties of longitudinal sound waves. This has made it a popular
and safe form of imaging with increasingly widespread applications. High-frequency
sound waves (3–15MHz) are generated in the transducer (transmitter and receiver)
by the vibrations of a piezo-electric quartz crystal as a voltage is applied. Passage of
sound waves through tissue is aff ected by attenuation and refl ection. Attenuation
disperses waves out of the receiver’s range, but it is the waves refl ected back to the
transducer that determine the image. Its quality depends on the diff erence in acoustic
impedance between adjacent soft tissues.
Processing With the help of software a real-time 2D image is made. During process-
ing, an average attenuation value is assumed throughout the tissue examined, so if
a higher-than-average attenuation structure is in the superfi cial tissues (eg fi brous
tissue, calcifi cation, or gas), then everything deep to it will be in a low intensity
(black) acoustic shadow. If a lower-than-average attenuation object (eg fl uid-fi lled/
cystic structure) is in the superfi cial tissues then everything deep to it will be high
intensity (white) or enhanced. If a tissue interface is strongly disparate, eg gas in
the intestine, then all the waves are refl ected back, making it impossible to image
beyond it. See also fi gs 16.21–16.24.
Modes B: (Brightness) is the most common, giving 2D slices that map the diff erent
magnitudes of echo in greyscale. M: (Movement) traces the movement of structures
within the line of the sound beam. It is used in imaging, eg heart valves (p110).
Duplex ultrasonography (fl ow and morphology) By combining Doppler eff ects
(shifts in wavelength caused by movement of a source or refl ecting surface) with
B-mode ultrasound technology, fl ow characteristics of blood can be inferred (fi g
16.21). This is extremely useful in arterial and venous studies, and echocardiography.
Advantages Portable; fast; non-ionizing; cheap; real-time; can be used with interven-
tion; can enter organs, eg rectum, vagina, bowel. Endoscopic US can be used to stage
and biopsy lung and GI tract cancers, eg stomach, pancreas, and also image the heart =
transoesophageal echocardiogram or TOE, p110.
Disadvantages Operator dependent—interoperator variability high; poor quality if
patient is obese; interference from bone, bowel gas, calculi, or superimposed organs
can limit depth and quality of imaging.

Nuclear medicine
The majority of medical imaging is concerned with passing external waves (eg ra-
diation) through the patient to a detector, and measuring scatter, slowing, or other
alterations by various tissues. Nuclear medicine is the opposite; it measures emitted
radiation from an internal source, introduced into the patient via injection, inhala-
tion, or ingestion. It can be diagnostic (eg PET scanning) or therapeutic (eg radio-
iodine (I131) ablation in thyrotoxicosis).
Because molecules labelled with radioisotopes are introduced into the patient,
there is exposure to ionizing radiation, though doses are usually less than those from
CT (see table 16.1, p719). The selection of molecule for labelling depends on the tissue
of interest, as it should be something that will be readily taken up by that tissue, eg
bisphosphonates for bone, glucose for fast-turnover tissue. Examples include:
Ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan Uses inhaled technetium (Tc) or, less commonly,
xenon-133 (133Xe) plus injected 99mTc macro-aggregates, which lodge in lung capillar-
ies. Normal perfusion excludes PE but ventilation component requires a normal CXR for
comparison (fi gs 16.25, 16.26). Due to the large number of ‘indeterminate’ scans VQ is
considered inferior to CTPA for the investigation of PE except in pregnancy (see p192).

Bone scintigraphy 99mTc-labelled bisphosphonates are readily taken up by bone,
and concentrate in areas of pathology, eg tumours, fractures. It is much more sensi-
tive in identifying metastases than X-ray, where lesions may not appear until >50%
of bone matrix has been destroyed (fi g 16.27).
Thyroid disease TcO is used for diff erentiating Graves’, toxic multinodular goitre,
4
and subacute thyroiditis (fi g 13.22, p601) as well as identifying ectopic tissue, func-
tioning nodules, and residual/recurrent thyroid tissue after surgery. ~15% of cold
(non-functioning) nodules are malignant. Hot nodules are often toxic adenomas.
Phaeochromocytoma Iodine-123 (123I) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is taken
up by sympathetic tissues, and indicates functioning, ectopic, and metastatic ad-
renal medullary (+other neural crest) tumours. 131I-MIBG is also used for treatment.
Hyperparathyroidism 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) scans can detect
parathyroid adenomas.
Haemorrhage Red cells are removed from the patient and labelled with 99mTc, then re-
injected to allow identifi cation of a bleeding point. Used in both acute (after endoscopy
and CT) and chronic GI bleeding, red cell scans are more sensitive than CT angiography
and useful in intermittent bleeding, although localization can be challenging.

Renal function Chromium-51 (51Cr) EDTA or DTPA (99mTc, p669) is used to assess GFR. 99mTc-
mercapto-acetyltriglycine (MAG3) technique
assesses relative (left–right) renal function
and renal transit time (eg in renovascular dis-
ease). 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
scanning (fi g 16.28) is the gold standard for
evaluation of renal scarring that occurs, eg in
refl ux nephropathy.
Positron emission tomography (PET) One of
the key investigations in malignancy, but also
has a wide range of other uses. If the tracer Fig 16.28 DMS showing relative renal

trated in metabolically active tissues. FDG de-
cays rapidly to produce a positron that, after travelling a few millimetres through
tissue, annihilates with an electron to produce a pair of high-energy photons (gamma
rays), which PET detects. Normal high uptake of FDG occurs in brain, liver, kidney, blad-
der, larynx, and lymphoid tissue of pharynx and must be considered when assess-
ing images. Neoplasms have high uptake of FDG with hotspots suggesting primary
disease or metastases. Since infl ammatory lesions will also show high uptake, there
is a risk of false-positive results (eg sarcoid, TB); diagnosis must be confi rmed with
histology of suspicious lesions. PET allows staging of many solid organ malignancies
(lung, melanoma, oesophageal) as well as lymphomas, and is particularly useful for
planning of radiotherapy and surgery for both primary disease and metastases. PET
can also be used to image occult sources of infection. PET can be combined with CT
or MRI to provide high-quality images combining anatomy with physiology. A range
of alternative tracers are now entering clinical use with radiotracers conjugated
to other tissue-specifi c substrates (eg 11C-labelled metomidate to detect tumors of
adrenocortical origin, somatostatin tracers in neuroendocrine tumours, and amyloid
tracers in Alzheimer’s disease).
Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) Similar to PET but rather
than using positron emission, it uses a radioisotope-labelled molecule as per con-
ventional nuclear imaging, but with two gamma cameras for detection. The images
produced are of lower resolution than PET but the isotopes used are longer lived and
more easily available. Examples include myocardial perfusion scanning (p741).

Cardiovascular imaging
CT Cardiac CT: Modern CT scanners can acquire images with suffi cient speed and
resolution to image coronary arteries and exclude signifi cant disease with a nega-
tive predictive value of 97–99%. It
can also visualize CABG patency, pro-
vide coronary artery Ca2+ scoring
(a risk factor for coronary artery
disease, p117), demonstrate car-
diac anatomy including congenital
anomalies, and estimate ventricular
function. Vascular CT: Has become
routine in emergency assessment
of suspected dissections, ruptured
aneurysms, and arterial and venous
thromboses (fi g 16.29). CT angiog-
raphy has overtaken invasive angi-
ography in the assessment of many Fig 16.29 CT angiogram showing type A (ascend-
conditions such as stable angina ing) aortic dissection with haemopericardium.
and renal artery stenosis. Courtesy of Dr C Cousins.
Catheter angiography Wherever intervention may be required, contrast studies
such as angiography provide both image clarity and the possibility of proceeding
to intervention, eg angioplasty or stenting of vessels, endovascular repair of an-
eurysms, clipping/coiling of aneurysms (see p746). Remember that these have a
high burden of both radiation and contrast medium, so check renal function before
requesting. Complications include those of arterial puncture (bleeding, infection,
thrombosis, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation) plus cholesterol emboli, throm-
boemboli, and vasospasm.
MRI Cardiac MRI using ECG-gating to acquire the imaging data and relate it to the
position in the cardiac cycle (best when the patient is in sinus rhythm) can reduce
movement artefact and lead to excellent resolution images for functional assess-
ment. This, coupled with a lack of radiation, makes it ideal for the assessment of
a wide range of structural and functional heart diseases. Flow velocities can be
measured and, because the fl ow is proportional to the pressure diff erences, degrees
of stenosis and regurgitation across heart valves can be calculated. Myocardial in-
farction, perfusion, and viability can also be imaged with the use of IV gadolinium
contrast (p748). Vascular MRI is used to limit radiation exposure where multiple
investigations may be required over a long time period, eg follow-up of intracranial
aneurysm coiling, aortic root size in a young patient with Marfan’s syndrome (p706),
or Takayasu’s arteritis (p712).
Ultrasound Non-invasive, relatively low cost, and with no radiation, US is excellent
for assessing the heart and vasculature particularly in acute settings where the
test can be performed at the bedside. Cardiac US (=echocardiography) evaluates
myocardial and valvular anatomy and function (p110). The use of exercise or pharma-
cological agents for ‘stress echocardiography’ can permit more detailed functional
assessment. Vascular US Doppler ultrasonography is widely used for detection of
thrombotic disease (eg DVT p578, portal vein thrombosis p276) and carotid athero-
sclerosis (p472).
Multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning is a non-invasive way to measure left
ventricle ejection fraction. After injection of 99mTc-labelled RBCS, a dynamic image of
the left ventricle is obtained for a few hundred heartbeats by gamma camera. Since
estimates of LVEF show less inter-operator variation than with echocardiograpy, uses
include the detailed serial assessment of LVEF in patients undergoing cardiotoxic chem-
otherapy (eg anthracyclines, trastuzumab).

Myocardial perfusion imaging A non-invasive method of assessing regional myo-
cardial blood fl ow and the cellular integrity of myocytes. The technique uses radio-
nuclide tracers which cross the myocyte membrane and are trapped intracellularly.
Thallium-201 (201Tl), a K+ analogue, is distributed via regional myocardial blood fl ow
and requires cellular integrity for uptake. Newer technetium-99 (99Tc)-based agents
are similar to 201Tl but have improved imaging characteristics, and can be used
to assess myocardial perfusion and LV performance in the same study (fi g 16.30).
Myocardial territories supplied by unobstructed coronary vessels have normal per-
fusion whereas regions supplied by stenosed coronary vessels have poorer relative
perfusion, a diff erence that is accentuated by exercise. For this reason, exercise tests
are used in conjunction with radionuclide imaging to identify areas at risk of ischae-
mia/infarction. Exercise scans are compared with resting views: reversible (ischae-
mia) or fi xed defects (infarct) can be seen and the coronary artery involved reliably
predicted. Drugs (eg adenosine, dobutamine, and dipyridamole) can also be used to
induce perfusion diff erences between normal and underperfused tissues.
Myocardial perfusion imaging adds information in patients presenting with acute
MI (to determine the amount of myocardium salvaged by thrombolysis) and in diag-
nosing acute chest pain in those without classical ECG changes (to defi ne the pres-
ence of signifi cant perfusion defects).
Fig 16.30 99Tc perfusion study showing perfusion defect in the left ventricle anterior and
lateral walls at stress which is partially reversible (diff erence between stress and rest im-
ages). This study is good for small vessel disease such as in diabetes; CT and coronary angi-
ography do not show small vessel disease well.

Gastrointestinal imaging
Ultrasound Widely used for imaging all intra-abdominal organs, including an
emerging role in small bowel imaging (though overlying bowel gas can cast acoustic
shadows). US is the 1st-line imaging choice for abnormal LFTS, jaundice, hepatomeg-
aly, renal dysfunction, and abdominal masses. Ensure the patient is ‘nil by mouth’
for 4 hours beforehand (aids gallbladder fi lling). Pelvic US needs a full bladder (con-
sider clamping the catheter if appropriate). US may also guide diagnostic biopsy and
therapeutic aspiration of cysts or collections.
CT plays an important role in the investigation of acute abdominal pain (see pp730–3).
It is unparalleled in the detection of free gas and intra-abdominal collections, and
allows good visualization of the colon and retroperitoneal areas. Oral or IV contrast
medium enhances defi nition (p730). The big disadvantage is the radiation dose. CT
colonography (CTC; fi g 16.31) uses rectal air or CO 2 insuffl ation, usually coupled with
an oral ‘stool tagging’ agent to visualize the colonic mucosa in those unfi t for endo-
scopic evaluation or in whom endoscopic evaluation has failed (eg in a stenosing tu-
mour, where it can be used to assess the proximal colon and allow assessment of liver
and nodal metastases at the same time). A negative test can be regarded as defi nitive
but if polyps or masses are seen then patients will usually require a colonoscopy.
Wireless capsule endoscopy: See p248.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) This gives excellent soft tissue imaging, giving
it an important role in imaging the liver, biliary system, pancreas, and pancreatic duct
(MRCP—magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; fi g 16.32). As well as assessing
potential malignant disease, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for detection of
common bile duct stones that can be missed on US. MRI performed after fl uid loading
of the small bowel (fl uid delivered orally=MRI enterography; fl uid delivered via nasodu-
odenal tube=MRI enteroclysis) permits assessment of small bowel infl ammation (eg
Crohn’s) and lesions that can be challenging to reach with conventional endoscopy.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; fi g 16.33) Indica-
tions: No longer routinely used for diagnosis, it still has a signifi cant therapeutic
role: sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones; stenting of benign or malignant
strictures and obtaining brushings to diagnose the nature of a stricture. Method:
A catheter is advanced from a side-viewing duodenoscope via the ampulla into the
common bile duct. Contrast medium is injected and images taken to show lesions in
the biliary tree and pancreatic ducts. Complications: Pancreatitis; bleeding; cholan-
gitis; perforation. Mortality <0.2% overall; 0.4% if performing stone removal.
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS; see p736.) Commonly used in diagnosis of upper GI
abnormalities, and is excellent for diagnosis of oesophageal, gastric, and pancreatic
cancers. It allows staging by assessing depth of invasion, as well as histological
diagnosis by biopsy of lesions.
Contrast studies (fi g 16.34) These can help in dysphagia (p250) and assessing
integrity of anastomoses post-op. Real-time fl uoroscopic imaging studies assess
swallowing function. Barium gives better contrast but iodine-based water-soluble
contrast medium is used if there is a concern of perforation. Contrast enemas are
increasingly obsolete and now used to exclude a leak following a low anterior resec-
tion, for proctograms, and not much else.

Genitourinary imaging
Ultrasound
Imaging modality of choice for genitourinary problems. Can be used to assess:
Kidneys:
• Renal size—small in chronic kidney disease, large in renal masses, cysts, hypertro-
phy if other kidney missing, polycystic kidney disease (fi g 16.35), and rarities (eg
amyloidosis, p370).
• Hydronephrosis, which may indicate ureteric obstruction or refl ux (fi g 13.49, p641).
• Perinephric collections (trauma, post-biopsy).
• Renal perfusion (assessment of renovascular disease: Doppler US of renal arteries).
• Transplanted kidneys (collections, obstruction, perfusion).
Lower urinary tract:
• Bladder volume: useful in assessment of the need to catheterize (see p640) or for
assessment of adequacy of bladder emptying (post-micturition residual volume).
• Prostate: transrectal ultrasound enables US-guided biopsy of focal lesions. NB: pros-
tate size does not correlate with symptoms.
Other:
• Ovarian cysts, size, infections (pyosalpinx), uterine fi broids and other masses.
• Testicular masses, hydrocele, varicocele.
Advantages: Fast; cheap; independent of renal function; no IV contrast or radiation
risk. Disadvantages: Intraluminal masses (transitional cell ca) in the upper tracts
may not be seen; not a functional study; only suggests obstruction if there is dilata-
tion of the collecting system (95% of obstructed kidneys) and so can miss obstruc-
tion from, eg retroperitoneal fi brosis.
CT (fi g 16.36) First choice in renal colic. Performed without intravenous contrast so
safe in renal impairment; such unenhanced images miss <2% of stones, but can show
other pathologies. With IV contrast, CT can delineate masses (cystic or solid, contrast
enhancement, calcifi cation, local/distant extension, renal vein involvement); assess
renal trauma (presence of two kidneys; haemorrhage; devascularization; laceration;
urine leak); and show retroperitoneal lesions. CT has all but replaced intravenous
urography and the radiation dose is similar.
Plain abdominal X-ray Can be used to look at the kidneys, the paths of the ureters,
and bladder. However, in practice it is only useful for monitoring known renal calculi.
Contrast studies Retrograde pyelography/ureterograms are good at showing
pelvi-calyceal, ureteric anatomy, and transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS). Contrast
medium is injected via a ureteric catheter. With the advent of cystoscopy, allowing
immediate intervention, these are rarely done in isolation. However, contrast me-
dium is routinely used in cystoscopic placement of retrograde stents for obstruction.
Percutaneous nephrostomy. Used in obstruction to decompress the renal pelvis,
which is punctured under local anaesthetic with imaging guidance. Images are ob-
tained following contrast injection (antegrade pyelogram). A nephrostomy tube is
then placed to allow decompression, sometimes followed by an antegrade stent if
there is no easily treatable cause of obstruction.
Renal arteriography (fi g 16.37) Therapeutic indications: angioplasty; stenting; em-
bolization (bleeding tumour, trauma, AV malformation).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Soft tissue resolution can help clarify equivo-
cal CT fi ndings. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) helps image renal artery
anatomy/stenosis (fi g 16.38) and is also used in the assessment of potential live do-
nors for kidney transplant, as well as to monitor patients following embolization of
tumours, arteriovenous malformations, and aneurysms.
Radionuclide imaging See p738.

Neuroimaging
CT (fi g 16.39) Imaging modality of choice for patients presenting with acute neu-
rological symptoms suggestive of a stroke. It is better than MRI at showing acute
haemorrhage and fractures, and is much easier to do in ill or anaesthetized patients,
and so is good in emergencies. The attenuation of biological soft tissues is in a nar-
row range from about +80 for blood and muscle, to 0 for CSF, and down to Ω100
for fat (Hounsfi eld units, p730). IV contrast medium initially gives an angiographic
eff ect, whitening the vessels. Later, if there is a defect in the blood–brain barrier
(eg tumours or infection), contrast medium will opacify a lesion’s margins, giving
enhancing white areas.
• Some CNS areas, eg pituitary gland, choroid plexus, have no blood–brain barrier
and enhance normally.
• Fresh blood is of higher attenuation (ie whiter) than brain tissue.
• In old haematomas, Hb breaks down and loses attenuation, so a subacute subdural
haematoma at 2wks may be of the same attenuation as adjacent brain.
• A chronic subdural haematoma will be of relatively low attenuation.
CT is often used in acute stroke to exclude haemorrhage (eg pre-antiplatelets) and
with perfusion scanning (fi g 16.14) to aid management decisions regarding throm-
bolysis. The actual area of infarction/ischaemia may not show up for a day or so, and
will be low-attenuation cytotoxic oedema (aff ecting both white and grey matter—
look for loss of grey matter defi nition).
Tumours and abscesses appear similar, eg a ring-enhancing mass, surrounding
vasogenic oedema, and mass eff ect. Vasogenic oedema (from leaky capillaries) is
extracellular and spreads through the white matter (grey matter spared). Mass ef-
fect causes compression of the sulci and ipsilateral ventricles, and may also cause
herniation (subfalcine, transtentorial, or tonsillar). See p483 (and also fi g 16.40).
Another indication for CT is acute, severe headache, eg suggestive of subarachnoid
haemorrhage (p478). An unenhanced CT may show fresh blood, hydrocephalus or
ICP, any of which could make LP unsafe.
CT angiography gives excellent mapping of the cerebral circulation (fi g 16.41), and
can be done directly after unenhanced CT, looking for an aneurysm if the unenhanced
CT shows subarachnoid haemorrhage.
MRI (MRI in stroke: fi g 10.19, p481) The chief image sequences are:
• T1-weighted images: Give good anatomical detail to which the T2 image can be
compared. Fat is brightest (signal intensity); other tissues are darker to varying
degrees. Flowing blood is low signal. Gadolinium contrast (p748) usually results in
an increase in signal intensity. See table 16.4.
• T2-weighted images: These provide the best detection of most lesions as they usu-
ally contain some oedema or fl uid and therefore appear white (eg fi g 16.20, p735).
Fat and fl uid appear brightest. Flowing blood is again low signal.
Magnetic resonance angiography maps carotid, vertebrobasilar, and cerebral ar-
terial circulations (and sinuses, veins). Functional MRI can image local blood fl ow.
Catheter angiography (fi g 16.42) Less commonly used since the advent of MRA and
CT angiography and perfusion techniques, though it has the advantage of allowing
immediate therapy—eg coil embolization of saccular aneurysms.
Radionuclide imaging (p738) PET is mostly used as a research tool in dementia,
but perfusion scintigraphy scan be used in the assessment of Alzheimer’s disease,
other dementias, and localizing epileptogenic foci. SPECT to visualize uptake of 123I-
FP-CIT (DaTSCAN™) can be used to assess reduced striatal dopaminergic transport in
Parkinson’s disease.

Contrast media in imaging
The use of a contrast medium can alter the electron density of two previously similar
tissues, thus allowing them to be distinguished. Contrast medium is usually admin-
istered by the following routes:
• PO: Barium- or iodine-based agents for, eg swallow or enhancing visualization of
bowel lumen on CT.
• Inhaled: Technetium or xenon used in ventilation scintigraphy.
• IV: (Most widespread clinical application.) Iodine or gadolinium.
• PR: Air or CO 2 can be introduced to the colon for CT colonography, iodinated con-
trast medium is used for water-soluble enemas.
Iodine-based contrast agents Iodine is used because of its relatively high elec-
tron density and good physiological tolerance. When used with CT, the exami-
nation is said to be contrast enhanced—look for ‘+ c’ amongst the scan details.
Exercise caution in: renal or cardiac impairment; myeloma; diabetes; sickle cell
disease; elderly; infants; the acutely unwell. Avoid iodine-based agents in active
hyperthyroidism.
Have renal function to hand in these patients (see p315). Minor reactions in-
clude nausea, vomiting, and a sensation of warmth. More severe reactions in-
clude urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, and low BP (1:250); theoretical risk
of death for 1:150 000.
Metformin should be withheld for 48h after IV contrast administration because
of the risk of lactic acidosis.
Barium sulfate Used in examination of the GI tract. Water-insoluble particles of
0.6–1.4μm diameter are mixed with large organic molecules such as pectin and
gum to promote good fl ow, mucosal adherence, and high density in thin layers.
Complications: Chemical pneumonitis or peritonitis. Never administer if you sus-
pect perforated viscus.
Water-soluble, non-ionic, iodine-based contrast agents Used instead of
barium where there is a risk of peritoneal contamination (eg fi stula, megacolon,
ulceration, diverticulitis, bowel anastomosis, acute intestinal haemorrhage). Gas-
trograffi n should not be used.
Contains iodine so establish allergy history and thyroid status.
Air In CT colonography, air (or CO 2) is insuffl ated as a negative contrast medium
after barium administration to enhance mucosal defi nition. Water can also be
used PO and PR to outline the lumen of the gut.
Gadolinium A lanthanide series element with paramagnetic qualities that is ad-
ministered intravenously (as gadolinium-DTPA) to enhance the contrast of certain
structures in MRI. It works by reducing the time to relaxation (TR) of hydrogen
nuclei in its proximity and appears as high signal on T1-weighted scans. It does
not cross the blood–brain barrier so is useful in enhancing isointense extra-axial
tumours such as meningiomas. It can also highlight areas where the blood–brain
barrier has broken down secondary to infl ammatory or neoplastic processes. It
is renally excreted: check eGFR: if signifi cantly reduced, gadolinium is contrain-
dicated, as up to 30% may develop progressive nephrogenic systemic fi brosis/
nephrogenic fi brosing dermopathy which causes generalized fi brosis which im-
pairs movement and breathing—and which may be fatal. Aberrations in calcium-
phosphate metabolism and erythropoietin treatment seem to increase risk. Other
adverse reactions include headache, nausea, and local irritation at the site of in-
jection, with idiosyncratic reaction reported in less than 1%.

Imaging the acutely unwell patient
Asking yourself ‘Does this investigation need to be done right now?’ will often
yield the answer ‘No!’, yet there are a few occasions when early imaging can
provide vital diagnostic information and infl uence the prognosis for a patient:
• Acute cauda equina syndrome (p466): MRI lumbar spine.
• Suspected thoracic aorta dissection (p655): CT thorax + IV contrast, MRI or
transoesophageal echo (TOE). The mediastinum is rarely widened on CXR.
• Suspected leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm (p654): CT aorta.
• Acute kidney injury (p298): US of renal tract to exclude obstruction.
• Acute pulmonary oedema: portable CXR: don’t delay to get an ideal fi lm.
• Acute abdomen with signs of peritonism: erect CXR to fi nd intraperitoneal free
gas (fi g 13.26, p607; ≈ GI perforation). Remember: post-op there will be detectable
gas (air/CO2) in the abdomen for ~10 days. CT if suspicion of intra-abdominal
source for sepsis or pathology requiring prompt surgery (eg appendicitis) . US
for ectopic pregnancy.
• Any patient with post-traumatic midline cervical spine tenderness—not just for
the emergency department! Collar and backboard immobilization followed by
a CT. All the vertebrae down to the top of T1 must be visualized and cleared before
it is safe to take the collar off .
• Sudden-onset focal neurology, worst-ever headache, deteriorating GCS: CT head,
then LP if no evidence of ICP.
Remember that imaging—or re-imaging for a poor quality fi lm—should never de-
lay the defi nitive treatment of an emergency condition, eg:
• Tension pneumothorax (p814 and fi g 16.43): decompression not CXR.
• Intra-abdominal haemorrhage or viscus rupture (p606): laparotomy.
• High clinical suspicion of torsion of testis (p652): surgery not Doppler US.
Prior to the advent of interventional radiology, a collapsed, shocked patient with
an acute abdomen would have skipped CT and gone straight for a laparotomy.
However, you should bear in mind that ruptured aneurysms are increasingly being
managed by endovascular repair under fl uoroscopic guidance (p654) so this is one
area where rapid imaging may be preferable to immediate intervention.
Fig 16.43 This is a great educational image from ICU. The inexperienced doctor could be dis-
tracted by the poor quality image, missing the lung bases: technicians do their best under dif-
fi cult conditions. To ask for a new CXR here would be a mistake note the large right-sided
tension pneumothorax needing immediate decompression! Lungs: The right lung fi eld is too
black compared to the left, the right hemidiaphragm is depressed, and the right lung is seen
collapsed against the mediastinum. Mediastinum: Left-shifted, obstructing venous return—so
cardiac output, and a threat to life. Is it being pushed or pulled? Check hila, bones, and soft tis-
sues. Since the right lung is collapsed and mediastinum shifted to left this suggests right ten-
sion pneumothorax. Needle thoracocentesis decompression and a chest drain are needed now.

Fig 17.1 Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was
a German astronomer and mathematician
who made many contributions to science,
not least of which was establishing the nor-
mal (Gaussian) distribution (see p751). After
his death, Gauss’s brain was examined by
anatomist Rudolph Wagner, to test the popu-
lar theory that intellectual ability correlated
with physical properties of the brain such as
weight and surface markings. While his brain
was noted to display an unusually intricate
pattern of sulci, lack of similarly patterned
sulci among the brains of other intellectuals
cast doubts on the theory. Further lack of evi-
dence to support Wagner’s hypothesis came
when Gauss’ brain was weighed: it would
perhaps have amused Gauss to learn that the
weight of his brain, whilst slightly above aver-
age, lay very much within the central region
of a Gaussian distribution. After some rather
sloppy housekeeping, Gauss’ brain was stored
in a mislabelled pot at the University in Göt-
tingen, accidentally switched with that of his
contemporary, the physician Conrad Fuchs.
Over 150 years later, some careful searching
of the archives and a MRI scanner revealed
the switch.

Statistics in medicine
• The normal (Gaussian) distribution curve. This bell-shaped graph (fi g 17.2) is the
theoretical basis of reference intervals, and explains ‘lab error’—why some tests
repeated at close intervals may reveal slightly diff erent values. Hb for example,
has a lab error of ~5g/L. This emphasizes the importance of the clinical picture in
decision-making, rather than treating the numbers alone: don’t subject anaemic
patients to blood transfusions unless they have a clinical need. See p324.
• Range is the lowest and highest value of all observations in the set being studied.
• Arithmetic mean is the sum of all observations ÷ by the number of observations.
• Median is the middle value (eg 9 data points are higher and 9 are lower). If their
distribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean.
• Standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance (the average of the
square of the distance of each data point from the mean). When the distribution of
the observations is Normal, 95% of observations are located in the interval ‘mean ±
1.96 SD’. This is the basis of the reference interval.
• Standard error of the mean gives an estimate of the reliability of the mean of a
sample representing the mean of the population from which the sample was taken,
and is the SD of the sample ÷ by the square root of the number of observations
in the sample. Thus the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error of
the mean—the basis of ensuring that clinical trial evidence is based upon enough
observations to be confi dent that diff erences seen between groups do not occur
by chance alone.

Drug ther apeutic ranges in plasma
Ranges should only be used as a guide to treatment. A drug in an apparently too
low concentration may still be clinically useful, while some patients require (and
tolerate) levels in the ‘toxic’ range.
The time since the last dose should be specifi ed on the request form.
Amikacin.1 Peak (1h post IV dose): 20–30mg/L. Trough: <10mg/L.
Carbamazepine.1 Optimal concentration: 20–50μmol/L (4–12mg/L).
Digoxin1 (6–12h post dose) 1–2.6nmol/L (0.8–2mcg/L). <1.3nmol/L may be toxic if
there is hypokalaemia. Signs of toxicity—CVS: arrhythmias, heart block. CNS: confu-
sion, insomnia, agitation, seeing too much yellow (xanthopsia), delirium. GI: nausea.
Gentamicin1,2 (p387) and tobramycin. 1, 2 The potential for oto- and nephrotoxic-
ity is high if aminoglycosides are used inappropriately, so only prescribe for short
therapeutic courses and follow local expert advice/guidelines. CI in severe renal or
liver failure, ascites, burns, high cardiac output states (eg anaemia, Paget’s disease),
children, and pregnancy. Signs of toxicity: tinnitus, deafness, nystag mus, vertigo,
renal failure. Once-daily dosing with dose adjustment is prefered as this has fewer
SES and better bactericidal activity (eg gentamicin 5mg/kg/d or tobramycin 4mg/
kg/d; check with pharmacist in obese patients or when using tobramycin in cystic
fi brosis). An exception to this dosing is endocarditis: split dosing (eg gentamicin
1mg/kg/8h or 12-hourly in renal failure) increases the synergistic bactericidal eff ect
of other agents. Trough (just before dose) levels and renal function should initially
be monitored daily (can be twice weekly in stable patients with normal renal func-
tion)—aim for trough: <1mg/L for both gentamicin and tobramycin. If the trough
level is out of range, withold the next dose until level <1mg/L (recheck after 12–24h).
Lithium2 (12h post dose). Guidelines vary: 0.4–0.8mmol/L is reasonable. Early signs
of toxicity (Li+ >1.5mmol/L): tremor. Intermediate: lethargy. Late: (Li+ >2mmol/L)
spasms, coma, fi ts, arrhythmias, renal failure (haemodialysis may be needed). See
OHCS p349.
Phenytoin.1,2 Trough: 40–80μmol/L (10–20mg/L). Beware if albumin, as the assay is
for bound phenytoin, while it is free pheny toin that is pharmacologically important.
Signs of toxicity: ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus, sedation, dysarthria.
Theophylline 10–20mg/mL (55–110μmol/L). (See p810.) Take sample 4–6h after
starting an infusion (which should be stopped for ~15min just before the specimen is
taken). Signs of toxicity: arrhythmias, anxiety, tremor, convulsions.
Vancomycin.1,2 Renally excreted; dosing guided by age and renal function but typi-
cally 500mg–1g/12h. Check trough levels prior to 3rd dose, aiming for: 5–10 mg/L
(10–15mg/L in SBE/IE and less-sensitive MRSA infections). If levels too low check drug
being given then cautiously increase dose; if levels high then confi rm timing of dose/
levels, omit next dose, recheck levels, and consider decreasing dose or frequency.
1 Trough levels should be taken just before the next dose. If values abnormally high, check that sample was
indeed a trough level and not taken post-dose.
2 Drugs for which routine monitoring is indicated.

Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated the benefi ts of handwash-
ing in the 1840s: he observed that maternal mortality was nearly three times as high
on a doctor-run maternity ward compared to a midwife-run ward. The explanation
remained elusive until Semmelweis’ friend Jakob Kolletschka died after receiving an
accidental scalpel cut from a student during a post-mortem demonstration. Sem-
melweis recognized in Kolletschka’s death many of the features of the dying moth-
ers. The explanation: the maternity ward doctors’ day started with post-mortem
examinations, from which they would procede to perform vaginal examinations on
the living without washing their hands. Noticing this, Semmelweis introduced the
practice of washing hands with chloride of lime and cut death rates to that of the
midwives’ patients. Despite the evidence he amassed, Semmelweis’s theory was
rejected by his contemporaries, a rejection which undoubtedly contributed to his
psychiatric distress, eventual commitment to an asylum, and ultimate death from
the blows of his guards. It would take another 20 years and countless deaths before
Lister published his landmark work on the use of carbolic acid in surgery.
Take a minute to wash your hands thoroughly before undertaking any procedure. This
prerequisite will not only reduce infection risk for your patients, but give you a moment
for mindfulness: focus on the hot water running over your hands, breathe deeply, and
for a while forget about your list of jobs. Perhaps spare Dr Kolletschka a thought. You
may fi nd that the subsequent procedure goes more smoothly than anticipated.
Training and the business of medicine
As medical training has evolved in an environment where patient safety is para-
mount, the old adage of ‘see one, do one, teach one’ is no longer relevant. ‘Just having
a go’ when you aren’t confi dent can have devastating consequences for the patient,
and also for you and your future. This creates tensions for training, but these are not
insurmountable. Seek out opportunities to learn practical procedures, ideally in a
controlled, elective setting, so that your fi rst attempt isn’t a life-or-death emergency
attempt—time spent in theatres or ICU will pay dividends in this regard. Many sen-
iors will be happy to make time to teach if you contact them in advance—let them
know you are interested and leave your bleep. Even in an emergency setting, it is
still wiser to seek help rather than attempting an urgent procedure for the fi rst time.
We thank our Specialist Reader, Dr Andrew Johnston, for his contribution to this chapter.

Nasogastric tubes
These tubes are passed into the stomach via the nose. Large (eg 16F) are good for
drainage but can be uncomfortable for patients. Small (eg 10F) are more comfort-
able for feeding but can be diffi cult to aspirate and are poor for drainage. Used:
• To decompress the stomach/gastrointestinal tract especially when there is ob-
struction, eg gastric outfl ow obstruction, ileus, intestinal obstruction.
• For gastric lavage.
• To administer feed/drugs, especially in critically ill patients or those with dys-
phagia, eg motor neuron disease, post CVA.
Passing the tube Nurses are experts and will ask you (who may never have
passed one) to do so only when they fail—so the fi rst question to ask is: ‘Have you
asked the charge-nurse from the ward next door?’
• Wear non-sterile gloves and an apron to protect both you and the patient.
• Explain the procedure. Take a new, cool (hence less fl exible) tube. Have a cup of
water to hand. Lubricate well with aqueous gel.
• Use the tube, by holding it against the patient’s head, to estimate the length
required to get from the nostril to the back of the throat.
• Place lubricated tube in nostril with its natural curve promoting passage down,
rather than up. The right nostril is often easier than the left but, if feasible, ask
the patient for their preference. Advance directly backwards (not upwards).
• When the tip is estimated to be entering the throat, rotate the tube by ~180° to
discourage passage into the mouth.
• Ask the patient to swallow a sip of water, and advance as they do, timing each
push with a swallow. If this fails: Try the other nostril.
• The tube has distance markings along it: the stomach is at ~35–40cm in adults, so
advance > this distance, preferably 10 –20cm beyond. Tape securely to the nose.
Confi rming position This is vital prior to commencing any treatment through the
tube. Misplaced nasogastric tubes have led to a number of preventable deaths,
and feeding via a misplaced tube is considered an NHS Never Event (a serious,
largely preventable patient safety incident that should never occur if the available
preventative measures have been implemented).
• Use pH paper to test that you are in the stomach: aspirated gastric contents are
acid (pH ≤5.5) although antacids or PPIS may increase the pH. Small tubes can be
diffi cult to aspirate, try withdrawing or advancing a few cm or turning the patient
on the left side to help dip the tube in gastric contents. Aspirates should be >0.5mL
and tested directly on unhandled pH paper. Allow 10s for colour change to occur.
• If the pH is >5.5 and the NGT is needed for drug or feed administration then the
position must be checked radiologically. Request a CXR/abdo X-ray (tell the radi-
ologist why you need it). Look for the radio-opaque line/tip (this can be hard to
see, look below the diaphragm, but if in doubt, ask for help from the radiologist).
• The ‘whoosh’ test is NOT an accepted method of testing for tube position.
• Either spigot the tube, or allow to drain into a dependent catheter bag secured
to clothing (zinc oxide tape around tube to form a fl ap, safety pin through fl ap).
Do not pass a tube nasally if there is any suspicion of a facial fracture.
Get senior help if the patient has recently had upper GI surgery—it is not good
practice to push the tube through a fresh anastomosis.
Complications •Pain, or, rarely: •Loss of electrolytes •Oesophagitis •Tracheal or
duodenal intubation •Necrosis: retro- or nasopharyngeal •Stomach perforation.
Weaning When planning removal of an NGT in situ for decompression or relief
of obstruction, it is wise to wean it so that the patient manages well without it.
Drainage should be <750mL/24 hours for successful weaning.
• First it should be on free drainage with, eg, 4hrly aspirations.
• Then spigot with 4hrly aspirations.
• Then spigot only. If this is tolerated along with oral intake then it is probably safe
to remove the tube; if not, then take a step backwards.

Placing IV cannulae
Much of what we do is not evidence based; however, in more recent years,
particularly in intensive care units, the rise of hospital-acquired infections and
multidrug-resistant organisms has prompted a review of standard practice and
a series of evidence-based interventions put together as a ‘care bundle’ to reduce
hospital-acquired infections. The technique for placing a cannula is best shown at
the bedside by an expert, but following these simple rules will signifi cantly reduce
the risk of infection from the cannula.
Preparation is key, remember the following before you start
1 Equipment: Set up a tray with cleaning swabs, gauze, cannulae (swallow your
pride and take at least three of diff erent sizes, see table 18.1), dressings, 0.9% sa-
line, 10mL syringe, needle-free adaptor (eg octopus with bionector), blood tubes
if required, portable sharps bin  needlestick injuries do happen.
2 Patient: Have them lying down, explain procedure, obtain verbal consent, place
tourniquet around arm, rest the arm below the heart to aid venous fi lling.
3 Site: Look for the best vein—it should be palpable; some of the best veins are not
easily visible, some of the most visible collapse on insertion. Tapping gently helps.
Never cannulate: AV fi stulae arms, limbs with lymphoedema. Avoid: Sites
crossing a joint (if possible), the cephalic vein in a renal patient.
4 Consider: EMLA® cream, cold spray, or 1% lidocaine for children or those with
needle phobia. EMLA® takes 45min to work, but can save you hassle later.
Insertion care bundle
1 Aseptic technique. 2 Hand hygiene. 3 Apron + non-sterile gloves. 4 Skin prepara-
tion—2% chorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol (allow to dry for 30 seconds). Do not
repalpate vein after cleaning unless wearing sterile gloves. 5 Dressing—sterile and
transparent so that insertion site can be observed.
After insertion
1 Take blood with syringe or adaptor. 2 Remove tourniquet. 3 Attach needle-free de-
vice (if appropriate) and fl ush with 10mL 0.9% saline. 4 Apply dressing. 5 Let nursing
staff know that cannula is in place and ready for use. 6 Document insertion according
to local policy. 7 Write up appropriate fl uids or parenteral medication.
When seeing your patient on the daily ward round (and to avoid being called to
review or replace cannulae at 6pm) do a RAID1 assessment: consider if the drip is:
Required—can the patient manage with oral medication/fl uids?
Appropriate—should you consider a PICC, central line, long-term line, etc?
Infected—any signs of infl ammation or infection? Remove if yes. Peripheral cannulae
should be replaced every 72–96 hours.
Dressed properly—many drips are replaced early because they have ‘fallen out’, or
are kinked from poor dressings.
Tissued or infected cannulae need replacing, either with another peripheral cannula,
or with a longer-term access device, such as a PICC line.
If you fail after three attempts Shocked patients need fl uid quickly: if you
are having trouble putting in a drip, call your senior. The following advice assumes
that the drip is not immediately life-saving. If it is, see BOX.
• Ask for help—from colleagues or seniors—do not be ashamed, everyone has to
learn and even senior doctors have bad days; a fresh pair of eyes can be all it takes.
As a house offi cer, one of us was asked to place a drip when a very shame-faced
consultant had ‘had a go’ to prove he still could, and found out that he couldn’t!
• Help yourself—try putting the hand in warm water, using a small amount of GTN
paste over the vein, or using ultrasound if available to help you identify the vein.
• If there is no one else to help, take a break and come back in half an hour. Veins
come and go, and coming back with fresh eyes can make all the diff erence.

Flow rate is given as maximum fl ow rate under gravity; faster rates may be achievable with rapid infusion devices.
According to Poiseuille’s law1 the fl ow rate (Q) of a fl uid through a tubular structure is inversely proportional
to viscosity (η) and length (l ) and proportional to the pressure diff erence across it (Pi Ω Po) and the radius
t o the power of 4(r 4). Hence: Q ∝ (Pi Ω η P lo) r 4
A last throw of the dice
Just once it may come down to you. For some, this is one of the challenges and
thrills in medicine. There may be no one else available to help when there is an
absolute and urgent indication for IV drugs/fl uids/blood—and all of the previously
discussed measures have been tried, and have failed. Think of lonesome night
shifts, over-run emergency departments, a disaster scene, war, or medicine in
the fi eld. The following measures are not recommended for non-life-threatening
scenarios:
 Don’t worry. Have a good look again. Feet (avoid in diabetics)? Inside of the
forearm? Upper arm?
 Have you really exhausted all of your options for help from a colleague? Maybe
the anaesthetist or ICU registrar is approachable—they do have remarkable skills.
 Is the patient familiar with his/her own veins (eg previous IV drug abuser)?
 If there is only a small amount of IV medication required and a small, short vein,
you may be able to gain access with a carefully placed butterfl y needle that is
taped down. Some drugs cannot be passed this way (eg amiodarone, K+).
 The external jugular vein may become prominent when the patient is head down
(Trendelenburg) by 5–10° (not in situations of fl uid overload, LVF, ICP). Only at-
tempt cannulation of this vein if you are not going to jeopardize future central
line insertion, and if you can clearly determine the surrounding anatomy.
 In an arrest situation, the 2015 Advanced Life Support Guidelines recommend
the intraosseous route in both adults and children if venous access is not pos-
sible; access devices should be available within resuscitation settings (eg emer-
gency department).
Only do the following if you have had the appropriate training/experience:
 In children, consider cannulating a scalp vein.
 Central venous catheterization (p775). This may be just as hard in a profoundly
hypovolaemic arrest patient, and a good knowledge of local anatomy and of the
procedure (± ultrasound guidance) will be invaluable.
If you don’t have an intraosseous access device, a cut down to the long saphen-
ous vein may be attempted, in extremis, even if you have no prior experience (at
this site you won’t kill by being ham-fi sted). Make a transverse incision 1–2cm
anterior and superior to the medial malleolus. Free vein with forceps. Cannulate
it under direct vision. Here, ‘fi rst do no harm’ is trumped by ‘nothing ventured,
nothing gained’.
Hopefully, it shouldn’t ever have to come to these measures, but one day…
1 Poiseuille’s law is a neat piece of physiology and worth remembering—it is applicable in some form to
almost every system in the body. Note that it is a 4th-power law: a small change in the radius makes a huge
diff erence to fl ow.

Catheterizing bladders
Urinary tract infections are the second commonest health care-associated infection,
and urinary catheters are frequently to blame. Think, does the patient really need a
catheter? If so, use the smallest you can and take out as soon as possible.
Size (in French gauge): 12=small; 16=large; 20=very large (eg 3-way). Material Coat-
ed latex catheters are soft and a good short-term option but unsuitable in true
latex allergy. Silastic (silicone) catheters may be used long term, but cost more. Sil-
ver alloy coating reduces infections. Shape Foley is typical (fi g 18.2); coudé (elbow)
catheters have an angled tip to ease around prostates but are more risky; 3-way
catheters are used in clot or debris retention and have an extra lumen for irrigation
fl uid, attached to the irrigation set via an extra port on the distal end (fi g 18.3). Get
urology advice before starting irrigation. Condom catheters are often preferred by
patients (less discomfort) even though they may leak and fall off .
Catheter problems • Infection: ~5% develop bacteraemia (most will have bacte-
rial colonization, antibiotics may not be required unless systemically unwell—discuss
with microbiology). A stat dose of, eg gentamicin 80mg is sometimes given pre-
insertion despite a lack of evidence for benefi t. Check your local policy. • Bladder
spasm: May be painful—try reducing the water in the balloon or an anticholinergic
drug, eg oxybutynin.
Per urethram Aseptic technique required.
Indications • Relieve urinary retention. • Monitor urine output in critically ill pa-
tients. • Collect uncontaminated urine for diagnosis.  It is contraindicated in ure-
thral injury (eg pelvic fracture) and acute prostatitis.
• Explain the procedure, and obtain verbal consent. Prepare a catheterization trolley:
gloves, catheter, lidocaine jelly, cleaning solution, drape, kidney dish, gauze swabs,
drainage bag, 10mL water and syringe, specimen container.
• Lie the patient supine: women with knees fl exed and hips abducted with heels to-
gether. Use a gloved hand to clean urethral meatus in a pubis-to-anus direction, hold-
ing the labia apart with the other hand. With uncircumcised men, retract the foreskin
to clean the glans; use a gloved hand to hold the penis still. The hand used to hold
the penis or labia should not touch the catheter. Place a sterile drape with a hole in
the middle to help you maintain asepsis. Remember: left hand dirty, right hand clean.
• Put sterile lidocaine 1–2% gel on the catheter tip and ≤10mL into the urethra (≤5mL
if ). In men, lift and gently stretch the penis upwards to eliminate any urethral
folds that may lead to false passage formation.
• Use steady gentle pressure to advance the catheter, rotating slightly can help it
slide in. Never force the catheter. Tilting the penis up towards the umbilicus while
inserting may help negotiate the prostate. Insert to the hilt; wait until urine emerg-
es before infl ating the balloon. Remember to check the balloon’s capacity before in-
fl ation (written on the outer end). Collect a sterile specimen and attach a drainage
bag. Pull the catheter back so that the balloon comes to rest at the bladder neck.
• If you are having trouble getting past the prostate, try: more lubrication, a gentle
twisting motion; a larger catheter; or call the urologists, who may use a guidewire.
Remember to reposition the foreskin in uncircumcised men after the catheter is
inserted to prevent oedema of the glans and paraphimos.
Documentation: In the notes be sure to document the indication for catheterization,
size of catheter, whether insertion was diffi cult or straightforward, any complica-
tions, residual volume and colour of urine. It is good practice to document that the
foreskin has been replaced. Sign with your name, date, and designation.
Suprapubic catheterization: Sterile technique required Absolutely contraindi-
cated unless there is a large bladder palpable or visible on ultrasound, because of the
risk of bowel perforation. Be wary, particularly if there is a history of abdominal or
pelvic surgery. Suprapubic catheter insertion is high risk and you should be trained
before attempting it, speak to the urologists fi rst.

Self-catheterization
This is a good, safe way of managing chronic retention from a neuropathic bladder
(eg in multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, spinal tumour, or trauma). Never
consider a patient in diffi culties from a big residual volume to be too old, young,
or disabled to learn. 5-yr-old children can learn the technique, and can have their
lives transformed—so motivation may be excellent. There may be fewer UTIs as
there is no residual urine—and less refl ux obstructive uropathy. Assessing suit-
ability entails testing sacral dermatomes: a ‘numb bum’ implies sensation of a
full bladder; higher sensory loss may mean catheterization will be painless. Get
help from your continence adviser who will be in a position to teach the patient
or carer that catheterizations must be gentle (the catheter is of a much smaller
calibre), particularly if sensation is lacking, and must number >4/d (‘always keep
your catheter with you; don’t wait for an urge before catheterizing’). See fi g 18.4.

‘The catheter is not draining…’
You will be asked to check catheters that are not draining. Check the fl uid chart
and the patient:
• Previously good output, now anuric: Blocked catheter until proven otherwise.
Was the urine clear previously or bloodstained? Consider fl ushing the catheter:
with aseptic technique fl ush and withdraw 20mL of sterile 0.9% saline with a
bladder syringe. This may get the fl ow going again. A 3-way catheter may be
needed if there is clot or debris retention. If it blocks again, replace it. Repeated
fl ushes lead to infection.
• Slow decline in urine output over several hours: In a dehydrated/post-op pa-
tient a fl uid challenge of 500mL STAT (250mL if cardiac comorbidity) may help,
come back and check the response in 30min. Check all other parameters (eg
pulse, BP, CVP) and increase rate of background IV fl uids if appropriate.
Acute kidney injury (p298): if urine output has tailed off and now stopped, the
cause is often renal hypoperfusion (ie pre-renal failure), but consider other fac-
tors, eg nephrotoxic drugs.
• Catheter is bypassing: A condom catheter may be more appropriate.
• Catheter has dislodged into the proximal (prostatic) urethra: Possible even
if the balloon is fully infl ated. Consider this if a fl ush enters but cannot be with-
drawn. If the patient still needs a catheter then replace it, consider a larger size.
• The catheter has perforated the lower urinary tract on insertion and is not
lying in the bladder or urethra: If suspected, call the urologists immediately.
Remember: urine output should be >400mL in 24h or >0.5mL/kg/h (see p576).
Trial without catheter (TWOC)
When it is time to remove a catheter, the possibility of urinary retention must be
considered. Remove the catheter fi rst thing one morning. If retention does occur,
insert a long-term catheter (eg silicone), consider an -blocker (p642), and arrange
urology TWOC clinic follow-up.

Draining ascites
For patients with refractory or recurrent ascites that is symptomatic, it is possible to
drain the ascites using a long pig-tail catheter. Paracentesis in such patients even in
the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may be safe. Learn at the bedside
from an expert.
Contraindications (these are relative, not absolute) End-stage cirrhosis; co-
agulopathy; hyponatraemia (126mmol/L); sepsis. The main complication of the
procedure is severe hypovolaemia secondary to reaccumulation of the ascites, so
intravascular replenishment with a plasma expander is required. For smaller vol-
umes, eg less than 5L, 500mL of 5% human albumin or Gelofusine® would be suf-
fi cient. For volumes over 5L, reasonable replacement would be 100mL 20% human
albumin IV for each 1–3 litres of ascites drained (check your local policy). You may
need to call the haematology lab to request this in advance.
Procedure Requires sterile technique.
• Ensure you have good IV access—eg 18G cannula in the antecubital fossa.
• Explain the procedure including the risks of infection, bleeding, hyponatraemia,
renal impairment, and damage to surrounding structures (such as liver, spleen,
and bowel), and obtain consent from the patient. Serious complications occur in
less than 1 in 1000 patients. Ask the patient to empty their bladder.
• Examine the abdomen carefully, evaluating the ascites and checking for orga-
nomegaly. Mark where you are going to enter. If in doubt, ask the radiology de-
partment to ultrasound the abdomen and mark a spot for drainage. Approach
from the left side unless previous local surgery/stoma prevents this—call a senior
for support and advice if this is the case.
• Prepare a tray with 2% chlorhexidine solution, sterile drapes, 1% lidocaine, sy-
ringes, needles, sample bottles, and your drain. Clean the abdomen thoroughly
and place sterile drapes, ensure you maintain sterile technique throughout. Infi l-
trate the local anaesthetic.
• Perform an ascitic tap (see p765) fi rst so that you know you are in the correct
place: remove 20mL fl uid for MC&S.
• Away from the patient, carefully thread the catheter over the (large and long)
needle using the guide so that the pig-tail has been straightened out. Remove
the guide.
• With the left hand hold the needle ~2.5cm (1 inch) from the tip—this will stop it
from advancing too far (and from performing an aortic biopsy). With the right
hand, hold the other end.
• Gently insert the needle perpendicular to the skin at the site of the ascitic tap up
to your hold with your left hand—ascites should now drain easily. If necessary,
advance the needle and catheter a short distance until good fl ow is achieved.
• Advance the catheter over the needle with your left hand, keeping the needle in
exactly the same place with your right hand. Do not re-advance the needle be-
cause it will go through the curled pig-tail and do not withdraw it because you
won’t be able to thread in the catheter.
• When fully inserted, remove the needle, connect the catheter to a drainage bag
(keep it below the level of the abdomen), and tape it down securely to the skin.
• The patient should stay in bed as the ascites drains.
• Document clearly in the notes the indication for the procedure, that consent was
obtained, clotting and U&ES checked pre-procedure, how much lidocaine was re-
quired, how much fl uid was removed for investigations, and whether there were
any complications to the procedure.
• Replenish intravascular volume with human albumin (see ‘Contraindications’ ear-
lier in topic).
• Ask the nursing staff to remove the catheter after 6h or after a pre-determined
volume has been drained (up to 20L can come off in 6h) and document this clear-
ly in the medical notes. Drains are removed after 4–6h to prevent infection.
• Check U&ES after the procedure and re-examine the patient.

Diagnostic taps
If you are unsure whether a drain is needed, a
diagnostic tap can be helpful. Whatever fl uid you
are sampling, a green needle carries far less risk
than a formal drain. It also allows you to decide
whether a drain is required.
Ascites may be sampled to give a cytological
or bacterial diagnosis, eg to exclude spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis (SBP; p276). Before starting,
know the patient’s platelets + clotting times. If
they are abnormal, seek help before proceeding.
• Place the patient fl at and tap out the ascites,
marking a point where fl uid has been identifi ed,
avoiding vessels, stomas, and scars (adhesions to
the anterior abdominal wall). The left side may
be safer—less chance of nicking liver (fi g 18.5). Fig 18.5 Always tap out the ascites,
• Clean the skin. Infi ltrate some local anaes- but aim approximately for 5cm me-

skin and advance while aspirating until fl uid is
withdrawn, try to obtain 60mL of fl uid.
• Remove the needle, apply a sterile dressing.
• Send fl uid to microbiology (15mL) for microscopy and culture, biochemistry
(5mL for protein, see p192), and cytology (40mL). Call microbiology to forewarn
them if urgent analysis of the specimen is required.
Diagnostic aspiration of a pleural eff usion
• If not yet done, a CXR may help evaluate the side and size of the eff usion.
• Ideally use US guidance at the bedside ( chance of successful aspirate and 
chance of organ puncture). If this is unavailable, ask an ultrasonographer to
mark a spot, or percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose a site
1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (usually posteriorly or laterally).
• Clean the area around the marked spot with 2% chlorhexidine solution.
• Infi ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine.
• Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of the
rib below the mark to avoid the neurovascular bundle (fi g 18.6). Aspirate whilst
advancing the needle. Draw off 10–30mL of pleural fl uid. Send fl uid to the lab
for chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH); bacteriology (microscopy and culture,
auramine stain, TB culture); cytology, and, if indicated, amylase and immunology
(rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, complement).
If you cannot obtain fl uid with a 21G needle, seek help.
• If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.

Inserting a chest drain
Indications
• Pneumothorax (p814): ventilated; tension; persistent/recurrent despite aspiration
(eg <24h after 1st aspiration); large 2nd spontaneous pneumothorax if >50yrs old.
• Malignant pleural eff usion, empyema, or complicated parapneumonic eff usion.
• Pleural eff usion compromising ventilation, eg in ICU patients.
• Traumatic haemopneumothorax.
• Post-operatively: eg thoracotomy; oesophagectomy; cardiothoracic surgery.
Pleural eff usions are best drained under US guidance using a Seldinger tech-
nique. This technique is also used for pneumathoraces (except in traumatic or
post-operative situations) without US guidance; for this reason it is detailed here.
Sterile procedure
• Identify the point for drainage. In eff usions, this should be done with US, ideally
under direct guidance or with a marked spot. For pneumothoraces, check the
drainage point from CXR/CT/examination.
• Preparation: trolley with dressing pack; 2% chlorhexidine; needles; 10mL syring-
es; 1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage
bottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient.
• Choose insertion site: 4–6th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary line—the
‘safe triangle’ (see BOX ‘The “safe triangle” for insertion’ and fi g 18.7). A more pos-
terior approach, eg the 7th space posteriorly, may be required to drain a locu-
lated eff usion (under direct US visualization) and occasionally the 2nd intercostal
space in the mid-clavicular line may be used for apical pneumothoraces—how-
ever, both approaches tend to be less comfortable.
• Maintain sterile technique—clean and place sterile drapes. Scrub for insertion.
• Prepare your underwater drain by fi lling the bottle to the marked line with ster-
ile water. Ensure this is kept sterile until you need it.
• Infi ltrate down to pleura with 10mL of 1% lidocaine and a 21G needle. Check that
air/fl uid can be aspirated from the proposed insertion site; if not, do not proceed.
• Attach the Seldinger needle to the syringe containing 1–2mL of sterile saline. The
needle is bevelled and will direct the guidewire; in general advance bevel up for
pneumothoraces, bevel down for eff usions.
• Insert the needle gently, aspirating constantly. When fl uid/air is obtained in the
syringe, stop, note insertion depth from the markings on the Seldinger needle.
Remove syringe, thread the guidewire through the needle. Remove the needle
and clamp the guidewire to the sterile drapes to ensure it does not move. Using
the markings on the Seldinger needle, move the rubber stops on the dilators to
the depth noted earlier, to prevent the dilator slipping in further than intended.
• Make a nick in the skin where the wire enters, and slide the dilators over the wire
sequentially from smallest to largest to enlarge the hole, keep gauze on hand. Slide
the Seldinger drain over the wire into the pleural cavity. Remove the wire and
attach a 3-way tap to the drain, then connect to the underwater drainage bottle.
• Suture the drain in place using a drain stitch—make a stitch in the skin close to the
drain site, tie this fairly loosely with a double knot. Then tie the suture to the drain.
It is usually best to be shown this before attempting it for yourself. Dress the drain,
and ensure it is well taped down.
• Check that the drain is swinging (eff usion) or bubbling (pneumothorax) and ensure
the water bottle remains below the level of the patient at all times. If the drain
needs to be lifted above the patient, clamp it briefl y. You should never clamp
chest drains inserted for pneumothoraces. Clamping for pleural eff usions can con-
trol the rate of drainage and prevent expansion pulmonary oedema.
• Request a CXR to check the position of the drain.
Removal In pneumothorax: Consider when drain is no longer bubbling and CXR
shows re-infl ation. Give analgesia beforehand, eg morphine. Smartly withdraw dur-
ing expiration or Valsalva. There is no need to clamp the drain beforehand as reinser-
tion is unlikely. In effusions: Generally the drain can be removed when drainage is
<200mL/24h, but for cirrhotic hydrothoraces the chest drain is treated similarly to
the ascitic drain (see p764) with HAS supplementation and removal at 4–6 hours.

The ‘safe triangle’ for insertion of a chest drain
Fig 18.7 The safe ‘triangle’ is not re-
ally a triangle, as the axilla cuts off the
point of the triangle. Draw a line along
the lateral border of pectoralis major, a
line along the anterior border of latis-
simus dorsi, and a line superior to the
horizontal level of the nipple. The apex
of the triangle is the axilla. Often chest
drains are inserted directly under ultra-
sound guidance, or with a pre-marked
spot; however, in an emergency or for
aspiration, the landmarks of the safe
triangle are important to know.
Complications
• Thoracic or abdominal organ injury. • Lymphatic damage  chylothorax.
• Damage to long thoracic nerve of Bell  wing scapula. • Rarely, arrhythmia.
Watch out for:
• Retrograde fl ow back into the chest.
• Persistent bubbling—there may be a continual leak from the lung.
• Blockage of the tube from clots or kinking—no swinging or bubbling.
• Malposition—check position with CXR.
Relieving a tension pneumothorax
Symptoms Acute respiratory distress, chest pain, respiratory arrest.
Signs Hypotension; distended neck veins; asymmetrical lung expansion; trachea
and apex deviated away from side of reduced air entry and hyperresonance to
percussion. There is no time for a CXR (but see fi g 16.43, p749).
Aim To release air from the pleural space. In a tension pneumothorax, air is drawn
into the intrapleural space with each breath, but cannot escape due to a valve-like
eff ect of the tiny fl ap in the parietal pleura. The increasing pressure progressively
embarrasses the heart and the other lung.
100% oxygen.
Prodedure
• Insert a large-bore IV cannula (eg Venfl on®) usually through the 2nd intercostal
space in the midclavicular line or the ‘safe triangle’ for chest drain insertion (see BOX
‘The “safe triangle” for insertion’). Remove the stylet, allowing the trapped air to es-
cape, usually with an audible hiss. This converts the tension pneumothorax to an open
pneumothorax. Tape securely. • Don’t recover the cannula as tensioning will recur.
• Proceed to formal chest drain insertion (see p766).
Aspiration of a pneumothorax
Identify the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line (or 4–6th intercostal
space in the midaxillary line) and infi ltrate with 1% lidocaine down to the pleura
overlying the pneumothorax.
• Insert a 16G cannula into the pleural space. Remove the needle and connect the
cannula to a 3-way tap and a 50mL syringe. Aspirate up to 2.5L of air (50mL≈50).
Stop if resistance is felt, or if the patient coughs excessively.
• Request a CXR to confi rm resolution of the pneumothorax. If successful, consider
discharging the patient and repeating the CXR after 24h to exclude recurrence,
and again after 7–10d. Advise to avoid air travel for 6 weeks after a normal CXR.
Diving should be permanently avoided.
• If aspiration is unsuccessful (in a signifi cant, symptomatic pneumothorax), insert
an intercostal drain (see p766).

Lumbar puncture (LP)
Contraindications •Bleeding diathesis. •Cardiorespiratory compromise. •Infection
at site of needle insertion. Most importantly:  ICP (suspect if very severe headache,
level of consciousness with falling pulse, rising BP, vomiting, focal neurology, or pap-
illoedema)—LP in these patients will cause coning, so unless it is a routine procedure,
eg for known idiopathic intracranial hypertension, obtain a CT prior to LP. CT is not
infallible, so be sure your indication for LP is strong.
Method Explain to the patient what sampling CSF entails, why it is needed, that co-
operation is vital, and that they can communicate with you at all stages.
• Place the patient on his or her left side, with the back on the edge of the bed, fully
fl exed (knees to chin). A pillow under the head and another between the knees may
keep them more stable.
• Landmarks: plane of iliac crests through the level of L 3/4 (see fi g 18.8). In adults, the
spinal cord ends at the L 1/2 disc (fi g 18.9). Mark L 3/4 intervertebral space (or one
space below, L 4/5), eg by a gentle indentation of a needle cap on the overlying skin
(better than a ballpoint pen mark, which might be erased by the sterilizing fl uid).
• Use aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves, gown) and 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alco-
hol to clean the skin, allow to dry and then place sterile drapes.
• Open the spinal pack. Assemble the manometer and 3-way tap. Have three plain
sterile tubes and one fl uoride tube (for glucose) ready.
• Using a 25G (orange) needle, raise a bleb of local anaesthetic, then use a 21G (green)
needle to infi ltrate deeper.
• Wait 1min, then insert spinal needle (22G, stilette in place) perpendicular to the
body, through your mark, aiming slightly up towards the umbilicus. Feel resistance
of spinal ligaments, and then the dura, then a ‘give’ as the needle enters the suba-
rachnoid space. NB: keep the bevel of the needle facing up, parallel with dural fi bres.
• Withdraw stilette. Check CSF fi lls needle and attach manometer (3-way tap turned
off towards you) to measure ‘opening’ pressure.
• Catch fl uid in three sequentially numbered bottles (10 drops per tube).
• Reinsert stilette then remove needle and apply dressing. Document the procedure
clearly in the notes including CSF appearance and opening pressure.
• Send CSF promptly for microscopy, culture, protein, lactate, and glucose (do plas-
ma glucose too)—call the lab to let them know. If applicable, also send for: cytol-
ogy, fungal studies, TB culture, virology (± herpes and other PCR), syphilis serology,
oligoclonal bands (+serum sample for comparison) if multiple sclerosis suspected.
Is there xanthochromia (p478)?
• If you fail; ask for help—try with the patient sitting or with radiological guidance.
CSF composition Normal values: Lymphocytes <5/mm3; no polymorphs; protein
<0.4g/L; glucose >2.2mmol/L (or ≥50% plasma level); pressure <200mm CSF. In men-
ingitis: See p822. In multiple sclerosis: See p496.
Bloody tap: This is an artefact due to piercing a blood vessel, which is indicated
(unreliably) by fewer red cells in successive bottles, and no yellowing of CSF (xa n-
thochromia). To estimate how many white cells (W) were in the CSF before the blood
was added, use the following:
W = CSF WCC Ω [(blood WCC ≈ CSF RBC) ÷ blood RBC].
If the blood count is normal, the rule of thumb is to subtract from the total CSF WCC
(per μL) one white cell for every 1000 RBCS. To estimate the true protein level, subtract
10mg/L for every 1000 RBCS/mm3 (be sure to do the count and protein estimation on
the same bottle). NB: high protein levels in CSF make it appear yellow. Subarachnoid
haemorrhage: Xanthochromia (yellow supernatant on spun CSF). Red cells in equal
numbers in all bottles (unreliable). RBCS will excite an infl ammatory response (eg CSF
WCC raised), most marked after 48h. Raised protein: Meningitis; MS; Guillain–Barré
syndrome. Very raised CSF protein: Spinal block; TB; or severe bacterial meningitis.

Complications
• Post-dural puncture headache. • Infection. • Bleeding. • Cerebral herniation
(rare, check for signs of ICP before proceeding). • Minor/transient neurological
symptoms, eg paraesthesia, radiculopathy.
Any change in lower body neurology after an LP (pain, weakness, sensory changes,
bladder/bowel disturbance) should be treated as cauda equina compression (hae-
matoma/abscess) until proven otherwise. Obtain an urgent MRI spine.
Post-LP brain MRI scans often show diff use meningeal enhancement with gado-
linium. This is thought to be a refl ection of increased blood fl ow secondary to
intracranial hypotension. Interpret these scans with caution and in the context of
the patient’s clinical situation. Ensure the reason for the scan and current neuro-
logical examination are discussed with the radiologist pre procedure.
Post-LP headache
Risk 10–30%, typically occurring within 24h of LP, resolution over hours to 2wks
(mean: 3–4d). Patients describe a constant, dull ache, more frontal than occipi-
tal. The most characteristic symptom is of positional exacerbation—worse when
upright. There may be mild meningism or nausea. The pathology is thought to
be continued leakage of CSF from the puncture site and intracranial hypotension,
though there may be other mechanisms involved.
Prevention Use the smallest spinal needle that is practical (22G) and keep the
bevel aligned as described on p768. Blunt needles (more expensive) can reduce risk
and are recommended (ask an anaesthetist about supply); however, collection of
CSF takes too long (>6min) if needles smaller than 22G are used. Before withdraw-
ing the needle, reinsert the stilette.
Treatment Despite years of anecdotal advice to the contrary, none of the follow-
ing has ever been shown to be a risk factor: position during or after the procedure;
hydration status before, during, or after; amount of CSF removed; immediate activ-
ity or rest post-LP. Time is a consistent healer. For severe or prolonged headaches,
ask an anaesthetist about a blood patch. This is a careful injection of 20mL of
autologous venous blood into the adjacent epidural space (said to ‘clog up the
hole’). Immediate relief occurs in 95%.

Cardioversion/defi brillation
Do not wait for a crisis before familiarizing yourself with the defi brillator, as there
are several types. All hospitals should include this information in your induction but
check how the machine on your ward works.
Indications To restore sinus rhythm if VF/VT; AF, fl utter, or supraventricular tachy-
cardias if other treatments (p126) have failed, or there is haemodynamic compro-
mise (p130 & p806). This may be done as an emergency,
eg VF/VT, or electively, eg AF.
Aim To completely depolarize the heart using a direct
current.
Procedure For VF/pulseless VT follow the ALS algo-
rithm on p894 and call the arrest team!

general anaesthetic or monitored heavy sedation. Fig 18.10 The dampened sine

• Almost all defi brillators are now paddle-free and use
‘hands-free’ pads instead (less chance of skin arc than
jelly). Place the pads on chest, one over apex (p39) and
one below right clavicle. The positions are often given
by a diagram on the reverse of the pad.
Cardioversion: Synchronize the shock with the rhythm
by pressing the ‘SYNC’ button on the machine. This en-

• Monophasic defi brillators: (fi g 18.10) Set the energy
level at 360J for VF/VT (arrest situation); 200J for AF; 50J for atrial fl utter.
• Biphasic defi brillators: (fi g 18.11) Impedance is less with a biphasic shock and
120–200J is used for shocks for VF/VT. They use less energy and are just as eff ective
as monophasic defi bs in cardio version. 120–200J will cardiovert most arrhythmias.
• Automatic external defi brillators: (AEDS) Can be used by anyone who can turn
them on and apply the pads. Follow the instructions given by the AED.
Shocking
1 Consider anticoagulation in AF (see p130).
2 Clearly state that you are charging the defi brillator.
3 Make sure no one else is touching the patient, the bed, or anything is in turn
touching these.
4 Clearly state that you are about to shock the patient.
5 Give the shock. If there is a change in rhythm before you shock and the shock
is no longer required, turn the dial to ‘discharge’. Do not allow anyone to ap-
proach until the reading has dropped to 0J.
6 After a shock: in resuscitation, resume CPR immediately and do not reassess
rhythm until the end of the cycle (see p894, fi g A3); in cardioversion, watch
ECG; consider need to repeat the shock. Up to three are usual for AF/fl utter.
7 Get an up-to-date 12-lead ECG.
In children, use 4J/kg in VF/VT; see OHCS p239.

Taking arterial blood gas (ABG) samples
Having an artery sampled
is more unpleasant for the
patient than venepuncture:
explain that it is going to feel
diff erent and is for a diff erent
purpose (p162 for indications
and analysis). The usual site is
the radial artery at the wrist.
Check with the patient that
they do not have an arterio-
venous fi stula for haemodial-
ysis. Never, ever sample from
a fi stula.
Procedure: Fig 18.12 The ideal position for the wrist, slightly hyperex-

syringes now come pre-made with needle); gloves; 2% chlorhexidine/70% alco-
hol swab; gauze; tape.
• Feel thoroughly for the best site. Look at both sides.
• Wipe with cleaning swab. Let the area dry. Get yourself comfortable.
• If the patient is drowsy or unconscious, ask an assistant to hold the hand and
arm with the wrist slightly extended (fi g 18.12).
• Before sampling, expel any excess heparin in the syringe. Infi ltration over the
artery with a small amount of 1% lidocaine (p573) through a 25G (orange) needle
makes the procedure painless.
• Hold the syringe like a pen, with the needle bevel up. Let the patient know you
are about to take the sample. Feel for the pulse with your other hand and enter
at 45°, aiming beneath the fi nger you are feeling with.
• In most syringes, the plunger will move up on its own in a pulsatile manner if
you are in the artery; rarely, entry into a vein next to the artery will give a similar
result. Colour of the blood is little guide to its source.
• Allow the syringe to fi ll with
1–2mL, then remove the needle
and apply fi rm pressure for 5
minutes (10 if anticoagulated).
• Expel any air from the syringe
as this will alter the oxygen-
ation of the blood. Cap and

else to apply pressure) as it should be analysed within 15 minutes of sampling.
• Syringes and analysis machines diff er, so get familiar with the local nuances.
The other site that is amenable to ABG sampling is the femoral artery (fi g 18.13).
Surprisingly this may be less uncomfortable as it is a relatively less sensitive area
and because, when supine, the patient cannot see the needle and thus may feel less
apprehensive. The brachial artery can also be used, but be aware that the median
nerve sits closely on its medial side and it is an end-artery. Normal values: p753.

Emergency airway management
Cricothyroidotomy Thsi is an emergency procedure to overcome airway obstruc-
tion above the level of the larynx. It should only be done in absolute ‘can’t intubate,
can’t ventilate’ situations, ie where ventilation is impossible with a bag and mask (±
airway adjuncts) and where there is an immediate threat to life. If not, call anaes-
thetics or ENT for immediate help.
Indications Upper airway obstruction when endotracheal intubation not possible,
eg irretrievable foreign body; facial oedema (burns, angio-oedema); maxillofacial
trauma; infection (epiglottitis).
Procedure Lie the patient supine with neck extended (eg pillow under shoulders)
unless there is suspected cervical-spine instability. Run your index fi nger down the
neck anteriorly in the midline to fi nd the notch in the upper border of the thyroid
cartilage (the Adam’s apple): just below this, between the thyroid and cricoid carti-
lages, is a depression—the cricothyroid membrane (see fi g 18.14). If you cannot feel
the depression and it is an emergency,
you can access the trachea directly ap-
proximately halfway between the cricoid
cartilage and the suprasternal notch.
Ideally use a purpose-designed kit
(eg QuickTrach∏, MiniTrach∏), all hos-
pitals will stock one version. If no kit is
available then a cannula (needle crico-
thyroidotomy) can buy time, and in out-
of-hospital situations a blade and empty
biro case have saved lives. Needle and
kit cricothyroidotomies are temporary Fig 18.14 The cricothyroid membrane.
measures pending formal tracheostomy.
1 Needle cricothyroidotomy: Pierce the membrane perpendicular to the skin with
large-bore cannula (14G) attached to syringe: withdrawal of air confi rms position;
lidocaine may or may not be required. Slide cannula over needle at 45° to the skin
superiorly in the sagittal plane. Use a Y-connector (see fi g 18.16) or improvise con-
nection to O2 supply at 15L/min: use thumb on Y-connector to allow O2 in over 1s
and CO2 out over 4s (‘transtracheal jet insuffl ation’). This is the preferred method in
children <12yrs. This will only sustain life for 30–45min before CO2 builds up. However,
if the patient has a completely obstructed airway then they will not be able to exhale
through this, and it will lead to cardiovascular compromise and pneumothoraces.
2 Cricothyroidotomy kit: Most contain a guarded blade, and a large (4–6mm)
shaped cannula (cuff ed or uncuff ed depending on brand) over an introducer, plus
a connector and binding tape. The patient will have to be ventilated via a bag, as
the resistance is too high to breathe spontaneously. This will sustain for 30–45min.
3 Surgical cricothyroidotomy: Smallest tube for prolonged ventilation is 6mm.
Introduce high-volume, low-pressure cuff tracheostomy tube through a horizontal
incision in membrane. Take care not to cut the thyroid or cricoid cartilages.
Complications Local haemorrhage ± aspiration; posterior perforation of trachea
± oesophagus; subglottic stenosis; laryngeal stenosis if membrane over-incised in
childhood; tube blockage; subcutaneous tunnelling; vocal cord paralysis or hoarse-
ness (the recurrent laryngeal nerve runs superiorly in the tracheo-oesophageal
groove).

Emergency needle pericardiocentesis
Fig 18.15 Emergency needle pericardiocentesis.
• Get your senior’s help (for whom this page may serve as an aide-memoire).
• Equipment: 20mL syringe, long 18G cannula, 3-way tap, ECG monitor, skin cleanser.
Use ECHO guidance if there is time.
• If time allows, use full aseptic technique, at a minimum clean skin with 2% chlo-
rhexidine in 70% alcohol and wear sterile gloves, and, if conscious, use local an-
aesthesia and sedation, eg with slow IV midazolam: titrate up to 3.5–5mg—start
with 2mg over 1min, 0.5–1mg in elderly (in whom the maximum dose is 3.5mg;
inject at the rate of 2mg/min)—antidote: fl umazenil 0.2mg IV over 15s, then 0.1mg
every 60s, up to 1mg in total.
Ensure you have IV access and full resuscitation equipment to hand.
• Introduce needle at 45° to skin just below and to left of xiphisternum, aiming
for tip of left scapula (fi g 18.15). Aspirate continuously and watch ECG. Frequent
ventricular ectopics or an injury pattern (ST segment) on ECG imply that the
myocardium has been breached—withdraw slightly. As soon as fl uid is obtained
through the needle, slide the cannula into place.
• Evacuate pericardial contents through the syringe and 3-way tap. Removal of
only a small amount of fl uid (eg 20mL) can produce marked clinical improve-
ment. If you are not sure whether the fl uid you are aspirating is pure blood (eg
on entering a ventricle), see if it clots (heavily bloodstained pericardial fl uid does
not clot), or measure its PCV (though this may be diffi cult in the acute setting but
some blood gas analysers may give this).
• You can leave the cannula in situ temporarily, for repeated aspiration. If there is
reaccumulation, insert a drain but perica rdiectomy may be needed.
• Send fl uid for microscopy and culture, as needed, including tests for TB.
Complications: Laceration of ventricle or coronary artery (± subsequent haemo-
pericardium); aspiration of ventricular blood; arrhythmias (ventricular fi brillation);
pneumothorax; puncture of aorta, oesophagus (± mediastinitis), or peritoneum (±
peritonitis).

Central venous cannulation
Central venous cannulae may be inserted to measure central venous pressure (CVP),
to administer certain drugs (eg amiodarone, chemotherapy), or for intravenous ac-
cess (fl uid, parenteral nutrition). In an emergency, the procedure can be done using
the landmark method (see p775), though NICE recommends that all routine internal
jugular catheters should be placed with US guidance. Even if the line is not placed
under direct US visualization, a look to check vessel size, position in relation to artery,
and patency (no thrombus or stenosis) is extremely useful. For contraindications,
see table 18.2.
Table 18.2 Contraindications to central venous cannulation
Absolute Relative
Infection at insertion site Coagulopathy
Ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy
Newly inserted cardiac pacemaker leads
Thrombus within the vein
Venous stenosis
Ipsilateral abnormal anatomy
Sites of insertion These include the internal jugular vein (see p775 and p43), sub-
clavian vein, and the femoral vein. The choice depends largely on operator experi-
ence, but evidence suggests that the femoral approach is associated with a higher
rate of line infection and thrombosis. Overall, the internal jugular approach (with
ultrasound guidance) is most commonly used and risks fewer complications than
the subclavian. If possible, get written consent (p568). Check clotting and platelets.
The technique for internal jugular (routine) and femoral (emergency) are given here.
Complications (~20%.) Insertion is not without hazard, so decide whether the pa-
tient requires a line fi rst, and then ask for help if you are inexperienced.
Bleeding; arterial puncture/cannulation; AV fi stula formation; air embolism; pneu-
mothorax; haemothorax; chylothorax (lymph); phrenic nerve palsy (the right phrenic
nerve passes over the brachiocephalic artery, posterior to the subclavian vein—hic-
cups may be a sign of injury); phlebitis; thrombus formation on tip or in vein (if high
risk for thromboembolism, eg malignancy, consider anticoagulation, eg LMWH); bac-
terial colonization; cellulitis; sepsis (can be reduced by adherence to a strict aseptic
technique; if taking blood cultures in a febrile patient with a central venous line,
remember to take samples from the central line and from a peripheral vein).
Peripherally inserted central cannulas (PICC lines) These are a good alternative
to central lines, as they can stay in situ for up to 6 months, and provide access for
blood sampling, fl uids, antibiotics (allowing home IV therapy). They are placed using
a Seldinger technique, puncturing the brachial or basilic vein then threading the
line into the subclavian or superior vena cava. Because of the insertion site there
is a much lower risk of pneumo- or haemothorax, but they are tricky to insert in an
emergency.
Removing central lines Should be done carefully with aseptic technique. Position
the patient slightly head down, remove dressings, clean and drape the area, remove
sutures. Ask the patient to inhale and hold their breath, then breathe out smoothly
while you are pulling the line out. This helps to prevent air emboli. Ask the patient
to rehearse this sequence with you to ensure they have understood their role. Apply
pressure for 5 minutes (longer if coagulopathic).

Internal jugular catheterization
Internal jugular Should be the approach of choice in a non-emergency situation.
Ideally the right side as it off ers a direct route to the heart and there is less chance
of misplacement of the line compared to the left. The subclavian approach is trickier
and best taught by an expert. Use US guidance if at all possible, ideally to insert the
line under direct vision, but at least to defi ne the anatomy. If possible, have the pa-
tient attached to a cardiac monitor in case of arrhythmias.
• Position the patient slightly head down to avoid air embolism and fi ll the veins to
improve your chances of success. This can compromise cardiac function and pre-
cipitate acute LVF so check if your patient has a cardiac history. Minimize the time
the patient is head down; if they are unable to lie fl at, consider a femoral approach.
Turn their head slightly to the left.
• This should be a sterile procedure so use full aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves,
gown) and clean with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol before draping.
Ensure your equipment is prepared, fl ush the catheter lumens with saline.
• If US is unavailable, the landmark procedure can be used to identify insertion
point—approximately at the junction of the two
heads of sternocleidomastoid at about the level
of the thyroid cartilage (fi g 18.17). Feel gently
for the carotid pulse, then infi ltrate with 1%
lidocaine just lateral to this. The vein is usually
superfi cial (fi g 18.18).
• Insert the introducer needle with a 5mL syringe
attached, advance gently at a 45° angle, aiming Fig 18.17 Position of internal
for the ipsilateral nipple and aspirating continu- jugular and subclavian veins (red)
ously. If you are using US, watch the needle tip compared to the clavicle (yellow).
enter the vein, if the landmark approach keep
your fi ngers on the carotid pulse.
• As soon as blood is aspirated, lay down the US
probe and hold the introducer needle in position,
remove the syringe and thread the guidewire
through the needle. It should pass easily, if there
is resistance try lowering the angle of the needle
and gently advancing the wire. If the wire will not
pass do not remove it alone, the tip can shear off Fig 18.18 Vessels seen on ultra-
and embolize; remove the needle with the wire, sound. The compressible vein is
above the artery.
apply pressure and attempt a second puncture.
• If the wire threads easily, insert to 30cm (see markings on the wire), remove the
needle keeping hold of the wire at all times. Make a nick in the skin with a scalpel
at the insertion point, and gently thread the dilator over the wire. You do not need
to insert the dilator far, only as far as the vein (you often feel a loss of resistance
as the dilator enters the vein, so insert gently: a pneumothorax can result from
enthusiastic dilating).
• Remove the dilator, keeping hold of the wire, thread the fl ushed catheter over
the wire, then remove the wire. The line should sit at about 13cm on the right side
(17cm on the left). Check you can aspirate blood from each lumen, then fl ush them.
• Suture the catheter in place (many have little ‘wings’ for suturing) and dress. Re-
quest a CXR to confi rm position and exclude pneumothorax. The tip of the catheter
should sit vertically in the SVC.
Femoral vein In an emergency situation where ultrasound is not easily accessible,
if the patient is unable to lie fl at, or where speed is of the essence, the femoral ap-
proach is often the safest, as there is no risk of pneumothorax or haemothorax and a
much reduced risk of arrhythmia. The technique is similar to internal jugular, except
the insertion point is just medial to the femoral artery at the groin crease.
Subclavian vein Should be taught by an expert and should ideally be carried out
under US guidance. Some physicians prefer this approach, but even in experienced
hands there is a risk of complications compared to US-guided internal jugular lines.

Inserting a temporary cardiac pacemaker
Often it is wiser to liaise with a specialist pacing centre to arrange prompt, defi nitive
pacing than to try temporary transvenous pacing, which often has complications
(see later in topic) and therefore may delay a defi nitive procedure.
Possible indications in the acute phase of myocardial infarction
• Complete AV block:
• With inferior MI (right coronary artery occlusion) pacing may only be needed if
symptomatic; spontaneous recovery may occur.
• With anterior MI (representing massive septal infarction).
• Second-degree block:
• Wenckebach (p99; implies decremental AV node conduction; may respond to
atropine in an inferior MI; pace if anterior MI).
• Mobitz type 2 block is usually associated with distal fascicular disease and car-
ries high risk of complete heart block, so pace in both types of MI.
• First-degree block: Observe carefully: 40% develop higher degrees of block.
• Bundle branch block: Pace prophylactically if evidence of trifascicular disease
(p100) or non-adjacent bifascicular disease.
• Sino-atrial disease + serious symptoms: Pace unless responds to atropine.
Other indications where temporary pacing may be needed
• Pre-op: if surgery is required in patients with type 2 or complete heart block
(whether or not MI has occurred); do 24h ECG; liaise with the anaesthetist.
• Drug poisoning, eg with -blockers, digoxin, or verapamil.
• Symptomatic bradycardia, uncontrolled by atropine or isoprenaline.
• Suppression of drug-resistant VT and SVT (overdrive pacing; do on ICU).
• Asystolic cardiac arrest with P-wave activity (ventricular standstill).
• During or after cardiac surgery—eg around the AV node or bundle of His.
Technique for temporary transvenous pacing Learn from an expert.
• Preparation: Monitor ECG; have a defi brillator to hand, ensure the patient has pe-
ripheral access; check that a radiographer with screening equipment is present. If
you are screening, wear a protective lead apron.
• Insertion: Using an aseptic technique, place the introducer into the (ideally right)
internal jugular vein (p775) or subclavian. If this is diffi cult, access to the right
atrium can be achieved via the femoral vein. Pass the pacing wire through the
introducer into the right atrium, ideally under radiological screening. It will either
pass easily through the tricuspid valve or loop within the atrium. If the latter oc-
curs, it is usually possible to fl ip the wire across the valve with a combined twisting
and withdrawing movement (fi g 18.19). Advance the wire slightly. At this stage the
wire may try to exit the ventricle through the pulmonary outfl ow tract. A further
withdrawing and rotation of the wire will aim the tip at the apex of the right ven-
tricle. Advance slightly again to place the wire in contact with the endocardium.
Remove any slack to risk of subsequent displacement.
• Checking the threshold: Connect the wire to the pacing box and set the ‘demand’
rate slightly higher than the patient’s own heart rate and the output to 3V. A paced
rhythm should be seen. Find the pacing threshold by slowly reducing the voltage
until the pacemaker fails to stimulate the tissue (pacing spikes are no longer fol-
lowed by paced beats). The threshold should be less than 1V, but a slightly higher
value may be acceptable if it is stable—eg after a large infarction.
• Setting the pacemaker: Set the output to 3V or over 3 times the threshold value
(whichever is higher) in ‘demand’ mode. Set the rate as required. Suture the wire to
the skin, and fi x with a sterile dressing.
• Check the position of the wire (and exclude pneumothorax) with a CXR.
• Recurrent checks of the pacing threshold are required over the next few days. The
formation of endocardial oedema can raise the threshold by a factor of 2–3.
Complications Pneumothorax; sepsis; cardiac perforation; pacing failure: from loss
of capture, loss of electrical continuity in pacing circuit, or electrode displacement.

Fig 18.19 Siting a temporary cardiac pacemaker.
Non-invasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing
This method (performed through a defi brillator with external pacing facility) has
the advantages of being quicker, less risky than the transvenous route, and easier
to perform. Its main disadvantage is the pain caused by skeletal muscle contrac-
tion in the non-sedated patient. Indications for pacing via the transcutaneous
route are as p776, plus if transvenous pacing (or someone able to perform it) is
unavailable or will be delayed in an emergency situation.
• Give sedation and analgesia, eg midazolam + morphine IV titrated to eff ect.
• Clipping chest hair may help improve electrical contact; don’t shave the skin, as
nicks can predispose to electrical burns. Ensure the skin is dry.
• Almost all modern transcutaneous devices can function through defi brillation
‘hands-free’ pads, and so these can be applied as for defi brillation (see p770).
If necessary, the pads can be placed in an AP position: anteriorly over the V2–V3
electrode position and posteriorly at the same level, just below the scapula.
• Select ‘demand’ mode, (which synchronizes the stimulus with the R wave, so
avoiding pacing on the T wave—which can provoke VF or VT) and adjust the ECG
gain so that QRS complexes can be seen.
• Select an appropriate pacing rate: eg 60–90bpm in an adult.
• Set the pacing current at the lowest setting and turn on the pacemaker.
• Increase the pacing current until electrical capture occurs (normally from 50–
100mA), which can be confi rmed by seeing a wide QRS complex and a T wave on
the trace (ventricular electrical capture).
• There will be some interference from skeletal muscle contraction on the ECG trace,
as well as possible artefact, which could be mistaken for a QRS complex. The ab-
sence of a T wave in the former is an important discriminator between the two.
• CPR can continue with the pads in place, though only when the pacing unit is off.
• Once adequate cardiac output has been maintained, seek expert help and ar-
range transvenous pacing.

Introduction to emergencies 779
Some doctors enjoy the adrenaline rush of seeing an emergency case and pulling
someone back from the edge of death. Some fear the emergency take, worried as
to what they will miss, how many will die. There is no right approach; the emer-
gency room needs both thought and practicality to manage patients. A patient
who comes in fl at and can be resuscitated gives the whole team a boost, as right
there in front of us is the proof that we can make a diff erence. However, a patient
who comes in well and collapses, dying before we can even decide what is wrong,
can bring the whole team down. There are nights where we save life after life, and
nights where we can’t; sometimes a death is inevitable, despite our best eff orts.
You are a doctor, but you are a human being as well, and losing a patient can feel
like a personal failure. However, remember that when we lose a patient it is the
disease that has killed them, not us. Try to take a few minutes and refl ect on what
happened; ask if you could have done anything diff erently. Should you have sought
help sooner? Discussing with a senior can be helpful, as can writing down your
refl ection, not in a portfolio for discussion at your appraisal, but in anonymous for-
mat for your own education. Watch the team at an arrest, the best leaders are the
ones who have learned to stand back, assess the whole situation, and take enough
time to see where the critical intervention is needed. There is no substitute for
experience, nobody becomes a consultant overnight, but watch the best clinicians
at work and you will learn both practical and life skills.
Most important in an emergency situation is communication. Wherever you can,
involve the relatives and the whole team in discussions, but remember that at the
heart of this is a patient. What do they want? Never be afraid to ask the patient
directly, they may hold very strong views. However, it is up to us as physicians to
be honest with them about their prognosis—do not off er a treatment you know
is not in the best interests of the patient, and this includes resuscitation. When
faced with death, many patients are afraid—our role is to try to relieve that fear,
whether by intervening to delay death, or by easing their passing. But we cannot
ever prevent death, we simply delay it. As Shakespeare has Julius Caesar say:
‘Of all the wonders that I have yet heard, it seems to me most strange that men
should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.’
ABCDE preliminary assessment (primary survey)
Airway Protect cervical spine, if injury possible.
Assessment: any signs of obstruction? Ascertain patency.
Management: establish a patent airway.
Breathing Assessment: determine respiratory rate, check bilateral chest move-
ment, percuss, and auscultate.
Management: if no respiratory eff ort, treat as arrest (see p894, fi g
A3), intubate and ventilate. If breathing compromised, give high-
concentration O2, manage according to fi ndings, eg relieve tension
pneumothorax.
Circulation Assessment: check pulse and BP; check if peripherally shut
down; check capillary refi ll; look for evidence of haemorrhage.
Management: if shocked, treat as on p790.
If no cardiac output, treat as arrest (see p894, fi g A3).
Disability Assess ‘level of consciousness’ with AVPU score (alert? responds to
voice? to pain? unresponsive?); check pupils: size, equality, reactions.
Glasgow Coma Scale, if time allows.
Exposure Undress patient, but cover to avoid hypothermia.
Quick history from relatives assists diagnosis: Events surrounding onset of illness,
evidence of overdose/suicide attempt, any suggestion of trauma? Past medical
history, especially diabetes, asthma, COPD, alcohol, opiate or street drug abuse,
epilepsy or recent head injury, recent travel. Medication, current drugs. Allergies.
Once ventilation and circulation are adequate, proceed to carry out history,
examination, investigations, and management in the usual way.

Headache: diff erential diagnosis
The vast majority of headaches are benign, but when taking a history do not forget
to ask about the following1 (early diagnosis can save lives):
Worrying features or ‘red fl ags’
• First and worst headache—subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478).
• Thunderclap headache—subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478: p480 for other causes).
• Unilateral headache and eye pain—cluster headache, acute glaucoma (p456).
• Unilateral headache and ipsilateral symptoms—migraine, tumour, vascular (p458).
• Cough-initiated headache—ICP/venous thrombosis (p480).
• Worse in the morning or bending forward—ICP/venous thrombosis (p480).
• Persisting headache ± scalp tenderness in over-50s—giant cell arteritis (p556).
• Headache with fever or neck stiff ness—meningitis (p822).
• Change in the pattern of ‘usual headaches’ (p456).
• Decreased level of consciousness (p456).
Two other vital questions:
• Where have you been? (Malaria, p416).
• Might you be pregnant? (Pre-eclampsia; especially if proteinuria and BP, p458.)
Always examine a patient presenting with a severe headache; if nothing about his-
tory or examination is concerning, both you and the patient will be reassured, but
subtle abnormalities are important not to miss.
No signs on examination
• Tension headache (p456).
• Migraine (p458).
• Cluster headache (p457).
• Post-traumatic (p456).
• Drugs (nitrates, calcium-channel antagonists) (p114).
• Carbon monoxide poisoning or anoxia. (p842)
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478).
Signs of meningism?
• Meningitis (may not have fever or rash—p822).
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478—examination may be normal).
Decreased conscious level or localizing signs?
• Stroke (p470).
• Encephalitis/meningitis (p822).
• Cerebral abscess (p824).
• Subarachnoid haemorrhage (pp478–9, fi gs 10.17, 10.18).
• Venous sinus occlusion (p480—focal neurological defi cits).
• Tumour (p498).
• Subdural haematoma (p482).
• TB meningitis (p393).
Papilloedema?
• Tumour (p498).
• Venous sinus occlusion (p480—focal neurological defi cits).
• Malignant (accelerated phase) hypertension (p138).
• Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (p498).
• Any CNS infection, if prolonged (eg >2wks)—eg TB meningitis (p393).
Others
• Giant cell arteritis (p556—ESR and tender scalp over temporal arteries).
• Acute glaucoma (p456—painful red eye—get pressures checked urgently).
• Vertebral artery dissection (p470—neck pain and cerebellar/medullary signs).
• Cervical spondylosis (p508).
• Sinusitis.
• Paget’s disease (p685—ALP).
• Altitude sickness (OHCS p770).

Breathlessness: emergency presentations
There may not be time to ask or the patient may not be able to give you a history in
acute breathlessness, this in itself can be a helpful sign (inability to complete sen-
tences in one breath = severe breathlessness, inability to speak/impaired conscious
level = life-threatening). Collateral history of known respiratory disease, anaphylaxis,
or other history can be extremely helpful but do not delay. Assess the patient for
the following:
Wheezing?
• Asthma (p810).
• COPD (p812).
• Heart failure (p800).
• Anaphylaxis (p794).
Stridor? (Upper airway obstruction.)
• Foreign body or tumour.
• Acute epiglottitis (younger patients).
• Anaphylaxis (p794).
• Trauma, eg laryngeal fracture.
Crepitations?
• Heart failure (p800).
• Pneumonia (p816).
• Bronchiectasis (p172).
• Fibrosis (p198).
Chest clear?
• Pulmonary embolism (p818).
• Hyperventilation.
• Metabolic acidosis, eg diabetic ketoacidosis (p832).
• Anaemia (p324).
• Drugs, eg salicylates.
• Shock (may cause ‘air hunger’, p790).
• Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (p400).
• CNS causes.
Others
• Pneumothorax (p814—pain, increased resonance, tracheal deviation if tension
pneumothorax).
• Pleural eff usion (p192—‘stony dullness’).
Key investigations
• Baseline observations—O2 sats, pulse, temperature, peak fl ow.
• ABG if saturations <94% or concern about acidosis/drugs/sepsis.
• ECG (signs of PE, LVH, MI?).
• CXR.
• Baseline bloods: glucose, FBC, U&E, consider drug screen.

Chest pain: diff erential diagnosis
First exclude any potentially life-threatening causes, by virtue of history, brief exami-
nation, and limited investigations. Then consider other potential causes. For the full
assessment of cardiac pain, see pp94, 118.
Life-threatening
• Acute myocardial infarction (pp796–9).
• Angina/acute coronary syndrome (pp796–9).
• Aortic dissection (p655).
• Tension pneumothorax (p814).
• Pulmonary embolism (p818).
• Oesophageal rupture (p820).
Others
• Pneumonia (p816).
• Chest wall pain:
• Muscular.
• Rib fractures.
• Bony metastases.
• Costochondritis.
• Gastro-oesophageal refl ux (p254).
• Pleurisy (p166).
• Empyema (p170).
• Pericarditis (p154).
• Oesophageal spasm (p250).
• Herpes zoster (p404).
• Cervical spondylosis (p508).
• Intra-abdominal:
• Cholecystitis (p634).
• Peptic ulceration (p252).
• Pancreatitis (p270).
• Sickle-cell crisis (p340).
Before discharging patients with undiagnosed chest pain, be sure in your own mind
that the pain is not cardiac (this pain is usually dull, may radiate to jaw, arm, or
epigastrium, and is usually associated with exertion). Carry out key investigations
and discuss options with a colleague, and the patient. Safety-net, telling the patient
to return or seek advice if they develop worrying features (specify these) or the pain
does not settle.
Key investigations
• CXR.
• ECG.
• FBC, U&E, and troponin (p118). Consider D-dimer only if low probability of venous
thromboembolism. See 'Modifi ed Wells' score for PE, p191.
Just because the patient’s chest wall is tender to palpation, this doesn’t mean the
cause of the chest pain is musculoskeletal. Even if palpation reproduces the same
type of pain, ensure that you exclude all potential life-threatening causes. Although
chest wall tenderness has discriminatory value against cardiac pain, it may be a
feature of a pulmonary embolism.

• Septicaemia (p792).
• Hypothermia.
• Myxoedema (p834), Addisonian crisis (p836).
• Hepatic/uraemic encephalopathy (pp275, 298).
Neurological:
• Trauma.
• Infection: meningitis (p822); encephalitis (eg herpes simplex—p404), tropical: ma-
laria (p416; do thick fi lms), typhoid, typhus, rabies, trypanosomiasis.
• Tumour: 1° or 2° (p528).
• Vascular: stroke (p470), subdural (p482), subarachnoid (p478), hypertensive en-
cephalopathy (p140).
• Epilepsy: non-convulsive status (p484) or post-ictal state.
Immediate management See fi g 19.2 (and coma CNS exam, p789).
• Assess Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. Consider intubation if GCS <8 (p788). Sup-
port the circulation if required (ie IV fl uids). Give O2 and treat any seizures. Protect
the cervical spine unless trauma is known not to be the cause.
• Check blood glucose; give eg 200mL 10% glucose IV stat if hypoglycaemia possible.
• IV thiamine if any suggestion of Wernicke’s encephalopathy; see later in topic.
• IV naloxone (0.4–2mg IV) for opiate intoxication (may also be given IM or via ET
tube); IV fl umazenil (p842) for benzodiazepine intoxication only if airway comp-
romised as risk of seizures especially if concomitant tricyclic intoxication.
Examination Vital signs are vital—obtain full set, including temperature.
• Signs of trauma—haematoma, laceration, bruising, CSF/blood in nose or ears, frac-
ture ‘step’ deformity of skull, subcutaneous emphysema, ‘panda eyes’.
• Stigmata of other illnesses: liver disease, alcoholism, diabetes, myxoedema.
• Skin for needle marks, cyanosis, pallor, rash (meningitis; typhus), poor turgor.
• Smell the breath (alcohol, hepatic fetor, ketosis, uraemia).
• Opisthotonus (fi g 9.45, p436) ≈meningitis or tetanus. Decerebrate/decorticate (p788)?
• Meningism (pp456, 822) but do not move neck unless cervical spine is cleared.
• Pupils (p789) size, reactivity, gaze.
• Heart/lung exam for BP, murmurs, rubs, wheeze, consolidation, collapse.
• Abdomen/rectal for organomegaly, ascites, bruising, peritonism, melaena.
• Are there any foci of infection (abscesses, bites, middle ear infection)?
• Any features of meningitis: neck stiff ness, rash, focal neurology?
• Note the absence of signs, eg no pin-point pupils in a known heroin addict.
Quick history From family, ambulance staff , bystanders: abrupt or gradual onset?
How found—suicide note, seizure? If injured, suspect cervical spinal injury and do not
move spine (OHCS p782). Recent complaints—headache, fever, vertigo, depression?
Recent medical history—sinusitis, otitis, neurosurgery, ENT procedure? Past medical
history—diabetes, asthma, BP, cancer, epilepsy, psychiatric illness? Drug or toxin
exposure (especially alcohol or other recreational drugs)? Any travel?
If the diagnosis is unclear:
• Treat the treatable: O 2; naloxone as above; glucose (eg 200mL of 10% IV); Pabrinex®
IV for Wernicke’s encephalopathy, p714; septic specifi cs: cefotaxime 2g/12h IV (men-
ingitis, p822), artemether/quinine (malaria, p418), aciclovir (encephalitis, p824).
• Do routine biochemistry, haematology, thick fi lms, blood cultures, blood ethanol,
drug screen, etc.
• Arrange urgent CT head, if normal, and no CI, proceed to LP.
The diagnosis should now be clear, eg hypo/hyperglycaemia; alcohol excess; poison-
ing; uraemia; pneumonia; subarachnoid; hypertensive/hepatic encephalopathy.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
This gives a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person. It can
be used by medical and nursing staff for initial and continuing assessment. It has val-
ue in predicting ultimate outcome. Three types of response are assessed, note in each
case the best response (or best of any limb) which should be recorded (table 19.1).
Table 19.1 The Glasgow Coma Scale
 Best motor response Best verbal response Eye opening
6 Obeying commands 5 Oriented (time, place, 4 Spontaneous
person)
5 Localizing to pain 4 Confused conversation 3 In response to speech
4 Withdrawing to pain 3 Inappropriate speech 2 In response to pain
3 Flexor response to pain 2 Incomprehensible sounds 1 None
2 Extensor response to pain 1 None
1 No response to pain
Adapted from 'Assessment of coma and impaired consciousness: a practical scale', Graham Teasdale and
Bryan Jennett, The Lancet, Vol 304, No. 7872, 81–84 (1974), Elsevier.
An overall score is made by summing the score in the three areas assessed.
• No response to pain + no verbalization + no eye opening = 3.
• Severe injury, GCS ≤8—consider airway protection.
• Moderate injury, GCS 9–12.
• Minor injury, GCS 13–15.
Causing pain is not a pleasant thing, there are acceptable and unacceptable meth-
ods. Try fi ngernail bed pressure with a pen/pencil, sternal pressure (not a rub), or
suprascapular squeeze. Abnormal responses to pain can help to localize the damage:
• Flexion = decorticate posture (arms bent inwards on chest, thumbs tucked in a
clenched fi st, legs extended) implies damage above the level of the red nucleus in
the midbrain.1
• Extension = decerebrate posture (adduction and internal rotation of shoulder, pro-
nation of forearm) indicates midbrain damage below the level of the red nucleus.
NB: an abbreviated coma scale, AVPU, is sometimes used in the initial assessment
(‘primary survey’) of the critically ill:
A = alert
V = responds to vocal stimuli
P = responds to pain
U = unresponsive
NB: GCS scoring is diff erent in young children; see OHCS p201.
1 Red nucleus output reinforces upper limb antigravity fl exion. When its output is damaged, the unregu-
lated reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts reinforce extension tone of upper and lower limbs.

The neurological examination in coma 789
This is aimed at locating the pathology in one of two places. Altered level of con-
sciousness implies either:
1 A diff use, bilateral, cortical dysfunction (usually producing loss of awareness
with normal arousal), or
2 Damage to the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) located through-
out the brainstem from the medulla to the thalami (usually producing loss of
arousal with unassessable awareness). The brainstem can be aff ected directly
(eg pontine haemorrhage) or indirectly (eg compression from transtentorial
or cerebellar herniation secondary to a mass or oedema).
Systematic examination:
• Level of consciousness; describe using objective words/AVPU.
• Respiratory pattern (p53)—Cheyne-Stokes (brainstem lesions or compression)
hyperventilation (acidosis, hypoxia, or, rarely, neurogenic), ataxic or apneustic
(breath-holding) breathing (brainstem damage with grave prognosis).
• Eyes—almost all patients with ARAS pathology will have eye fi ndings:
1 Visual fi elds—in light coma, test fi elds with visual threat. No blink in one fi eld
suggests hemianopia and contralateral hemisphere lesion.
2 Pupils—normal direct and consensual refl exes present = intact midbrain.
Midposition (3–5mm) non-reactive ± irregular = midbrain lesion. Unilateral
dilated and unreactive (‘fi xed’) = 3rd nerve compression. Small, reactive =
pontine lesion (‘pin-point pontine pupils’) or drugs. Horner’s syndrome (p702,
fi g 15.4) = ipsilateral lateral medulla or hypothalamus lesion, may precede
uncal herniation. Beware patients with false eyes or who use eye drops for
glaucoma.
3 Extraocular movements (EOMS)—observe resting position and spontaneous
movement; then test the vestibulo-ocular refl ex (VOR) with either the doll’s-
head manoeuvre (normal if the eyes keep looking at the same point in space
when the head is quickly moved laterally or vertically) or ice water calorics
(normal if eyes deviate towards the cold ear with nystagmus to the other
side). If present, the VOR exonerates most of the brainstem from the VIIth
nerve nucleus (medulla) to the IIIrd (midbrain). Don’t move the head unless
the cervical spine is cleared.
4 Fundi—papilloedema, subhyaloid haemorrhage, hypertensive retinopathy,
signs of other disease (eg diabetic retinopathy).
• Examine for CNS asymmetry (tone, spontaneous movements, refl exes). One way
to test for hemiplegia in coma is to raise both arms together and compare how
they fall under gravity. If one descends fast, like a lead weight, but the other
descends more gracefully, you have found a valuable focal sign of cortical dys-
function. The same applies to the legs.

Shock
Circulatory failure resulting in inadequate organ perfusion. Often defi ned by BP—
systolic <90mmHg—or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65mmHg—with evidence of
tissue hypoperfusion, eg mottled skin, urine output (UO) of <0.5mL/kg/h, serum
lactate >2mmol/L. Signs: GCS/agitation, pallor, cool peripheries, tachycardia, slow
capillary refi ll, tachypnoea, oliguria.
MAP = cardiac output (CO) ≈ systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
CO = stroke volume ≈ heart rate.
  shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both.
Inadequate cardiac output
• Hypovolaemia:
• Bleeding: trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, GI bleed.
• Fluid loss: vomiting, burns, ‘third-space’ losses, eg pancreatitis, heat exhaustion.
• Pump failure:
• Cardiogenic shock, eg ACS, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, acute valve failure.
• Secondary causes, eg PE, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade.
Peripheral circulatory failure (loss of SVR)
• Sepsis: (p792) Infection with any organism can cause acute vasodilation from
infl ammatory cytokines. Gram –ves can produce endotoxin, causing sudden and
severe shock but without signs of infection (fever,  WCC). Classically patients with
sepsis are warm & vasodilated, but may be cold & shut down. Other diseases, eg
pancreatitis, can give a similar picture associated with the infl ammatory cascade.
• Anaphylaxis: p794.
• Neurogenic: Eg spinal cord injury, epidural or spinal anaesthesia.
• Endocrine failure: Addison’s disease, p836 or hypothyroidism; see p834.
• Other: Drugs, eg anaesthetics, antihypertensives, cyanide poisoning.
Assessment ABCDE (p779). With shock we are dealing primarily with ‘C ’ so get
large-bore IV access ≈2 and check ECG for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will
compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischaemia.
• General review: Cold and clammy suggests cardiogenic shock or fl uid loss. Look
for signs of anaemia or dehydration, eg skin turgor, postural hypotension? Warm
and well perfused, with bounding pulse points to septic shock. Any features sug-
gestive of anaphylaxis—history, urticaria, angioedema, wheeze?
• CVS: Usually tachycardic (unless on -blocker, or in spinal shock—OHCS p757) and
hypotensive. But in the young and fi t, or pregnant women, the systolic BP may
remain normal, although the pulse pressure will narrow, with up to 30% blood
volume depletion. Diff erence between arms (>20mmHg)—aortic dissection (p655)?
• JVP or central venous pressure: If raised, cardiogenic shock likely.
• Check abdomen: Any signs of trauma, or aneurysm? Any evidence of GI bleed?
Management If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.
• Septic shock: See p792.
• Anaphylaxis: See p794.
• Cardiogenic shock: See p802.
• Hypovolaemic shock: Identify and treat underlying cause. Raise the legs.
• Give fl uid bolus 10–15mL/kg crystalloid via large peripheral line, if shock improves,
repeat, titrate to HR (aim <100), BP (aim SBP >90) and UO (aim >0.5mL/kg/h).
• If no improvement after 2 boluses, consider referral to ICU.
• Haemorrhagic shock: Stop bleeding if possible. See table 19.2 for grading.
• If still shocked despite 2L crystalloid or present with class III/IV shock then
crossmatch blood (request O Rh–ve in an emergency, see p348).
• Give FFP with red cells (1 : 1 ratio); aim for platelets >100 and fi brinogen >1 (guided
by results, but eg 1 pool of platelets and 2 pools of cryoprecipitate per 6–8 units
of red cells). Consider tranexamic acid 2g IV. Discuss with haematology early.
• Heat exposure (heat exhaustion):
• Tepid sponging + fanning; avoid ice and immersion. Resuscitate with IVI, eg 0.9%
saline ± hydrocortisone 100mg IV. Lorazepam 1–2mg IV or chlorpromazine 25mg
IM/IV may be used to stop shivering. Stop cooling when core temperature <39°C.

Sepsis
Sepsis is a major killer. There are >150 000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year result-
ing in >44 000 deaths, and much morbidity.
Sepsis Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response
to infection.
Septic shock Sepsis in combination with:
• EITHER lactate >2mmol/L despite adequate fl uid resuscitation
• OR the patient is requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65mmHg.
 Sepsis recognition
Many sepsis-related deaths could be prevented with earlier treatment. Often, the
key failure in sepsis management is not recognizing sepsis in time. Early warning
scores (p892, fi g A1) help identify inpatients who are becoming septic.
Have a low threshold for assessing for sepsis if:
• the patient has communication diffi culties: limited English; limited verbal com-
munication; cognitive impairment
• the patient is immunosuppressed, on chemotherapy, or an IV drug user
• the patient recently had surgery or is pregnant/recently gave birth
• the patient has indwelling lines/other foreign material.
 Assessing risk in sepsis
Table 19.3 Risk criteria in sepsis
 Moderate- to high-risk criteria High-risk criteria
Reports of altered mental state or acute Objective evidence of altered mental
deterioration in functional status state
Respiratory rate (RR) 21–24 RR>24; new requirement for FiO2 >40%
to keep sats >92% (>88% in COPD)
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 91–100mmHg SBP <90 or >40mmHg less than baseline
Heart rate 91–130bpm or new arrhythmia Heart rate >130bpm
Urine output: nil for 12–18h; 0.5–1.0mL/kg/h Urine output: nil for 18h; <0.5mL/kg/h if
if catheterized catheterized
Local signs of infection, incl. redness, swell- Mottled, ashen, or cyanotic skin. Non-
ing, or discharge around wound blanching rash (p822)
Rigors, or temperature <36°C
Impaired immunity (illness or drugs)
Recent surgery/trauma/invasive procedure
When there is a suspicion of sepsis, the criteria in table 19.3 are used to assess the
patient’s risk of death or serious illness from sepsis as follows:
High risk: At least one high-risk criterion OR at least two moderate- to high-risk
criteria with AKI or LACTATE >2.
Moderate to high risk: At least one moderate- to high-risk criterion.
Low risk: No moderate- or high-risk criteria.
Acute management in sepsis Early recognition and treatment is key. See fi g 19.3.2
Antibiotics: These should be broad spectrum and start within 1h. Consider covering
for non-bacterial microbes, eg give aciclovir if HSV encephalitis is suspected.
Fluids: Give within 1h if high risk with SBP <90, AKI, or lactate >2 (consider if <2).
• Give 500mL boluses of crystalloids with 130–154mmol/L sodium (eg 0.9% saline)
over 15mins. Caution in heart failure.
• If no improvement after two boluses, speak with a senior.
Oxygen: Give oxygen as required for target saturations. These will be 94–98% (or
88–92% if the patient is at risk of CO2 retention, eg in severe COPD).
Critical care review: Speak with critical care early if intensive care support (eg
inotropes, ventilation, haemofi ltration, intensive monitoring) may be required.
Surgical involvement: Eg emergency wound debridement.
Manage acute complications: Shock (p790), AKI (p298), DIC (p352), ARDS (p186), ar-
rhythmias (may spontaneously resolve when sepsis improves).

 Acute management of sepsis in adults
Recognize the need to assess for sepsis
• Consider possibility of sepsis in any patient with signs or symptoms
that are suggestive of infection (eg productive cough or off ensive
oozing wound)
• Consider non-specifi c signs (patient/carer concern; altered mental
state; feeling generally unwell), particularly when there is reason to
have low threshold for sepsis assessment (see BOX)
Gather information
History: Full medical history: take time to clarify the time course of symp-
toms and any travel history
Examination:
• General: capillary refi ll time, mottled/ashen skin, conscious level
• Localize source of infection: don’t forget to assess wounds/ulcers which may
be hidden by dressings
Bedside tests: Blood gas for lactate, observations incl. HR, BP, RR, sats, tem-
perature; ECG; urine dip and urine output monitoring
Assess risk (see BOX)
High risk Moderate to high risk Low risk
Request immediate Clinician review within 1h. Manage according to
senior review Senior review within 3h if clinical judgement
cause not identifi ed
Investigations
Blood tests: Serial ABGS, or VBGS for lactate; blood cultures; U&E, CRP,
FBC, LFT, clotting screen
Micro samples: Sputum and urine for MC&S; swab any wounds; con-
sider LP; send fl uid from drains and lines; joint aspirates; ascitic tap
Imaging: CXR, consider CT/USS/MRI/echo of suspected source
Treatment
Antibiotics ± other antimicrobials
Fluids
Oxygen
Liaise with other teams
• Critical care, surgeons, medical specialties
Manage acute complications
Review
Immediately alert a consultant if, after 1h of antibiotics and fl uids:
• SBP <90 •RR >30 •Reduced GCS
• Raised lactate not reduced by >20%
Consider critical care referral.

Anaphylactic shock
Type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Release of histamine and other agents
causes: capillary leak; wheeze; cyanosis; oedema (larynx, lids, tongue, lips); urticaria.
More common in atopic individuals. An anaphylactoid reaction results from direct
release of mediators from infl ammatory cells, without involving antibodies, usually
in response to a drug, eg acetylcysteine.
Examples of precipitants
• Drugs, eg penicillin, and contrast media in radiology.
• Latex.
• Stings, eggs, fi sh, peanuts, strawberries, semen (rare).
Signs and symptoms
• Itching, sweating, diarrhoea and vomiting, erythema, urticaria, oedema.
• Wheeze, laryngeal obstruction, cyanosis.
• Tachycardia, hypotension.
Mimics of anaphylaxis
• Carcinoid (p271).
• Phaeochromocytoma (p228, p837).
• Systemic mastocytosis.
• Hereditary angioedema.

 Management of anaphylaxis 795
Secure the airway—give 100% O2
Intubate if respiratory obstruction imminent
Remove the cause; raising the feet
may help restore the circulation
Give adrenaline IM 0.5mg (ie 0.5mL of 1:1000).
Repeat every 5min, if needed as guided by BP, pulse,
and respiratory function, until better
Secure IV access
Chlorphenamine 10mg IV and
hydrocortisone 200mg IV
IVI (0.9% saline, eg 500mL over ¼h; up to 2L may be needed)
Titrate against blood pressure
If wheeze, treat for asthma (p810)
May require ventilatory support
If still hypotensive, admission to ICU and an IVI of adrena-
line may be needed ± aminophylline (p811) and nebulized
salbutamol (p811): get expert help
Further management:
• Admit to ward. Monitor ECG
• Measure serum tryptase 1–6h after suspected anaphylaxis
• Continue chlorphenamine 4mg/6h PO if itching
• Suggest a ‘MedicAlert’ bracelet naming the culprit allergen
• Teach about self-injected adrenaline (eg 0.3mg, Epipen®) to
prevent a fatal attack
• Skin-prick tests showing specifi c IgE help identify allergens
to avoid
Fig 19.4 Management of anaphylaxis.
Adrenaline (=epinephrine) is given IM and NOT IV unless the patient is severely ill,
or has no pulse. The IV dose is different: 100mcg/min—titrating with the response.
This is 0.5mL of 1 : 10 000 solution IV per minute. Stop as soon as a response has been
obtained.
If on a -blocker, consider salbutamol IV in place of adrenaline.

Acute coronary syndrome—with ST-elevation
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) includes unstable angina, STEMI, and NSTEMI (p798).
STEMI is a common medical emergency; prompt appropriate treatment saves lives.3
Initial treatment See fi g 19.5. Take brief history, do a quick physical examination
and a 12-lead ECG. Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia.
Other tests on admission: U&E, troponin, glucose, cholesterol, FBC, CXR.
• Aspirin: 300mg PO (if not already given); consider ticagrelor (180mg PO) or prasug-
rel (60mg PO if no history of stroke/TIA and <75yrs) as newer alternatives to clopi-
dogrel (300mg PO) as they have been shown to be superior in outcome studies.
• Morphine: 5–10mg IV (repeat after 5min if necessary). Give anti-emetic with the 1st
dose of morphine: metoclopramide 10mg IV (1st line), or cyclizine 50mg IV (2nd line).
• GTN: routine use now not recommended in the acute setting unless patient is hyper-
tensive or in acute LVF. Useful as anti-anginal in chronic/stable patients.
• Oxygen is recommended if patients have SaO2 <95%, are breathless or in acute LVF.
• Restore coronary perfusion in those presenting <12h after symptom onset (see BOX).
• Anticoagulation: An injectable anticoagulant must be used in primary PCI. Bivali-
rudin is preferred, if not available use enoxaparin ± a GP IIb/IIIa blocker.
• ß-blockers provide additional benefi t when started early, eg bisoprolol 2.5mg PO OD.
Ensure no evidence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, asthma/COPD, or heart block.
Right ventricular infarction Confi rm by demonstrating ST elevation in rV3/4 and/
or echo. NB: rV4 means that V4 is placed in the right 5th intercostal space in the
midclavicular line. Treat hypotension and oliguria with fl uids (avoid nitrates and diu-
retics). Monitor BP carefully, and assess early signs of pulmonary oedema. Intensive
monitoring and inotropes may be useful in some patients.
 Reperfusion therapy
Early coronary reperfusion saves lives; decisions must be taken quickly so seek
senior advice early. Look for typical clinical symptoms of MI plus ECG criteria:
• ST elevation >1mm in ≥2 adjacent limb leads or >2mm in ≥2 adjacent chest leads.
• LBBB (unless known to have LBBB previously).
• Posterior changes: deep ST depression and tall R waves in leads V1 to V3.
Therapy may be percutaneous intervention (PCI—with angiographic identifi cation of
the culprit blockage(s) and revascularization via deployment of an expandable met-
al stent) or thrombolysis (with systemically administered clot-dissolving enzymes):
• Primary PCI: Should be off ered to all patients presenting within 12h of symptom
onset with a STEMI who either are at or can be transferred to a primary PCI cen-
tre within 120min of fi rst medical contact. If this is not possible, patients should
receive thrombolysis and be transferred to a primary PCI centre after the infusion
for either rescue PCI (if residual ST elevation) or angiography (if successful). Use
beyond 12h if evidence of ongoing ischaemia or in stable patients presenting after
12–24h may be appropriate—seek specialist advice.
• Thrombolysis: Benefi t reduces steadily from onset of pain, target time is
<30min from admission; use >12h from symptom onset requires specialist advice.
Do not thrombolyse ST depression alone, T-wave inversion alone, or normal ECG.
Thrombolysis is best achieved with tissue plasminogen activators (eg tenect-
eplase as a single IV bolus). CI: •Previous intracranial haemorrhage. •Ischaemic
stroke <6months. •Cerebral malignancy or AVM. •Recent major trauma/surgery/
head injury (<3wks). •GI bleeding (<1 month). •Known bleeding disorder. •Aortic
dissection. •Non-compressible punctures <24h, eg liver biopsy, lumbar puncture.
Relative CI: •TIA <6 months. •Anticoagulant therapy. •Pregnancy/<1wk post par-
tum. •Refractory hypertension (>180mmHg/110mmHg). •Advanced liver disease.
•Infective endocarditis. •Active peptic ulcer. •Prolonged/traumatic resuscitation.
Patients with STEMI who do not receive reperfusion (eg presenting >12h after
symptom onset) should be treated with fondaparinux, or enoxaparin/unfraction-
ated heparin if not available.

Acute coronary syndrome—without ST-elevation
First stabilize with medical therapy; early risk stratifi cation will identify those in
need of further treatment and prompt angiography (involve cardiologists).4
Assessment
Brief history: (See p36.) Previous angina, relief with rest/nitrates, history of cardio-
vascular disease, risk factors for IHD.
Examination: (See p38.) Pulse, BP, JVP, cardiac murmurs, signs of heart failure, pe-
ripheral pulses, scars from previous cardiac surgery.
Investigations ECG: ST depression; fl at or inverted T-waves; or normal; FBC, U&E, tro-
ponin, glucose, random cholesterol; CXR.
Management See fi g 19.6 for acute management, but p796 if ST elevation. The aim
of therapy is to control pain then initiate anti-ischaemic and antiplatelet therapy.
Oral antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 300mg PO, followed by 75mg OD. For those with
confi rmed ACS give a second antiplatelet agent, eg clopidogrel (300mg PO then 75mg
OD PO). Ticagrelor (180mg then 90mg/12h PO) is a prefered alternative, particularly in
higher risk groups5 (eg • ≥60yrs age •previous stroke, TIA, MI, or CABG •known coro-
nary artery stenosis ≥50% in ≥2 vessels or carotid stenosis ≥50% •DM •peripheral
arterial disease •chronic kidney disease). Prasugrel (60mg then 10mg/d PO) is an
alternative to clopidogrel for those undergoing PCI. In practice, if the history is typi-
cal but ECG changes are non-diagnostic and troponin results are awaited, treatment
with eg clopridogrel is often given on clinical suspicion; if troponin testing then con-
fi rms ACS, it is still appropriate to give either ticagrelor or prasugrel to those patients
in whom it is indicated, even if clopidogrel has already been given.
Anticoagulation: Ideally fondaparinux (factor Xa inhibitor) 2.5mg OD; if not avail-
able, use low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, eg enoxaparin 1mg/kg/12h) or un-
fractionated heparin (aim APTT 50–70s) until discharge.
ß-blockers: In higher-risk patients with no contraindications (consider diltiazem
as alternative). Do not use -blockers with verapamil—can precipitate asystole.
Nitrates (PO or IV): For recurrent chest pain.
ACE-i: Should be given to all patients unless there are CI (monitor renal function).
Lipid management: Start early, eg atorvastatin 80mg OD (see p120).
Prognosis Overall risk of death ~1–2%, but ~15% for refractory angina despite medi-
cal therapy. Risk stratifi cation can help predict those most at risk and allow interven-
tion to be targeted at those individuals: calculate using GRACE score.2 The following
are associated with an increased risk:
• History of unstable angina.
• ST depression or widespread T-wave inversion.
• Raised troponin (except patients with ST elevation MI).
• Age >70 years.
• General comorbidity, previous MI, poor LV function or DM.
High-risk patients should be considered for inpatient coronary angiography. Symp-
tomatic lesions may be addressed by coronary stenting or CABG (see p123).
Further measures
• Wean off glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion when stabilized on oral drugs.
• Continue fondaparinux (or LMWH or heparin) until discharge.
• Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia. Check serial ECGS,
and troponin >12h after pain.
• Address modifi able risk factors: smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes.
• Gentle mobilization.
• Ensure patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, -blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin.
If symptoms recur, refer to cardiologist for urgent angiography & PCI or CABG.
2 GRACE = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Risk is scored based on age, heart rate, BP, re-
nal function, Killip class of heart failure, and other events, eg raised troponin. Very complicated
to calculate so recommendation by European Society of Cardiology is to use an online calculator,
eg http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/.

Severe pulmonary oedema
Causes
• Cardiovascular, usually left ventricular failure (post-MI or ischaemic heart disease).
Also valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and malignant hypertension.
• ARDS (p186) from any cause, eg trauma, malaria, drugs. Look for predisposing fac-
tors, eg trauma, post-op, sepsis. Is aspirin overdose or glue-sniffi ng/drug abuse
likely? Ask friends/relatives.
• Fluid overload.
• Neurogenic, eg head injury.
Diff erential diagnosis Asthma/COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema are often
hard to distinguish, especially in the elderly, where they may coexist. If the patient is
extremely unwell and you are not sure, consider treating all three (eg with salbuta-
mol nebulizer, furosemide IV, diamorphine, amoxicillin—p386).
Symptoms Dyspnoea, orthopnoea (eg paroxysmal), pink frothy sputum. NB: note
drugs recently given and other illnesses (recent MI/COPD or pneumonia).
Signs Distressed, pale, sweaty, pulse, tachypnoea, pink frothy sputum, pulsus alter-
nans, JVP, fi ne lung crackles, triple/gallop rhythm (p44), wheeze (cardiac asthma).
Usually sitting up and leaning forward. Quickly examine for possible causes.
Investigations
• CXR (p135, pp722–4): cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary oedema: look for shadowing
(usually bilateral), small eff usions at costophrenic angles, fl uid in the lung fi ssures,
and Kerley B lines (septal linear opacities).
• ECG: signs of MI, dysrhythmias.
• U&E, troponin, ABG.
• Consider echo.
• BNP (p137) may be helpful if diagnosis in question (high negative predictive value).
Management See fi g 19.7. Begin treatment before investigations.
Monitoring progress: BP; pulse; cyanosis; respiratory rate; JVP; urine output; ABG.
Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia.
Once stable and improving:
• Daily weights, aim reduction of 0.5kg/day, check obs at least QDS.
• Repeat CXR.
• Change to oral furosemide or bumetanide.
• If on large doses of loop diuretic, consider the addition of a thiazide (eg bendrofl u-
methiazide or metolazone 2.5–5mg daily PO).
• ACE-i if LVEF <40%. If ACE-i contraindicated, consider hydralazine and nitrate (may
also be more eff ective in African-Caribbeans).
• Also consider -blocker and spironolactone (if LVEF <35%).
• Is the patient suitable for biventricular pacing or cardiac transplantation?
• Optimize management of AF if present (p130); consider anticoagulation.

 Management of acute heart failure 801
Sit the patient upright
High-fl ow oxygen if SpO2*
IV access and monitor ECG
Treat any arrhythmias, eg AF (pp124–31)
Investigations whilst continuing treatment
See p800
Diamorphine 1.25–5mg IV slowly
Caution in liver failure and COPD
Furosemide 40–80mg IV slowly
Larger doses required in renal failure
GTN spray 2 puff s SL or 2 ≈ 0.3mg tablets SL
Don’t give if systolic BP <90mmHg
Necessary investigations, examination, and history
If systolic BP ≥100mmHg, start a nitrate infusion,
eg isosorbide dinitrate 2–10mg/h IVI; keep systolic BP ≥90mmHg
If the patient is worsening:
• Further dose of furosemide 40–80mg
• Consider CPAP—improves ventilation by recruiting more alveoli, driving fl uid out
of alveolar spaces and into vasculature (get help before initiating!)
• Increase nitrate infusion if able to do so without dropping systolic BP <100mmHg
• Consider alternative diagnoses, eg hypertensive heart failure, aortic dissection,
pulmonary embolism, pneumonia
If systolic BP <100mmHg, treat as cardiogenic shock (p802) and refer to ICU
*Avoid supplemental oxygen if not hypoxaemic since may cause vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac out-
put. If known COPD, hypoxaemia still needs correcting; give high-fl ow oxygen but monitor closely for CO2
retention (check serial ABG if needed) and reduce fl ow as soon as possible.

Cardiogenic shock
This has a high mortality and is very diffi cult to treat. Ask a senior physician’s help
both in formulating an exact diagnosis and in guiding treatment.
Cardiogenic shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion primarily due to cardiac
dysfunction. It may occur suddenly, or after progressively worsening heart failure.
Causes
• Myocardial infarction (pp796–9).
• Arrhythmias (pp124–31).
• Pulmonary embolus (p818).
• Tension pneumothorax (p814).
• Cardiac tamponade (p154 and later in topic).
• Myocarditis; myocardial depression (drugs, hypoxia, acidosis, sepsis) (p152).
• Valve destruction (endocarditis—p150).
• Aortic dissection (p655).
Management See fi g 19.8.
If the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital (see p796).
• Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU.
• Investigation and treatment may need to be done concurrently.
• Investigations: ECG, U&E, troponin, ABG, CXR, echocardiogram. If indicated, CT thorax
(speak with radiologists, this can be protocolled for both aortic dissection and PE) .
• Monitor: CVP, BP, ABG, ECG, urine output. Keep on cardiac monitor/telemetry. Record
a 12-lead ECG every hour until the diagnosis is made. Consider a CVP line and an arte-
rial line to monitor pressure, if these are in situ consider measuring cardiac output
and volume status.3 Catheterize for accurate urine output.
Cardiac tamponade Pericardial fl uid collects  intrapericardial pressure rises 
heart cannot fi ll  pumping stops.
Causes: Trauma, lung/breast cancer, pericarditis, myocardial infarct, bacteria, eg
TB. Rarely: urea, radiation, myxoedema, dissecting aorta, SLE. Also coronary artery
dissection (secondary to PCI) and/or ruptured ventricle.
Signs: BP, JVP, and muffl ed heart sounds (Beck’s triad); JVP on inspiration (Kuss-
maul’s sign); pulsus paradoxus (pulse fades on inspiration). Echocardiography may
be diagnostic. CXR: globular heart; left heart border convex or straight; right cardio-
phrenic angle <90°. ECG: electrical alternans (p154).
Management: This can be very diffi cult. Everything is against you: time, physiology,
and your own confi dence, as the patient may be too ill to give a history, and signs
may be equivocal—but bitter experience has taught us not to equivocate for long.
Request the presence of your senior at the bedside (do not make do with telephone
advice). With luck, prompt pericardiocentesis (p773) brings swift relief. While await-
ing this, give O2, monitor ECG, and set up IVI. Take blood for group & save. NB: there
may be a role for cardiothoracic surgery (eg CABG, ventricular repair, or pericardial
window) as a defi nitive solution to some causes.
3 Eg Pulse contour cardiac output (PICCO) or lithium dilution cardiac output (LIDCO). Both use injection
(PICCO = cold water, LIDCO = lithium) to estimate fi lling pressure, extravascular water (ie pulmonary oedema)
and cardiac output. The time from injection via a central vein to detection via an arterial line, plus dilution,
gives estimates of cardiac output and volume status and can guide fl uid and inotrope therapy.

Broad complex tachycardia
ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complexes >120ms (>3 small squares on ECGS
done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s). Identify the underlying rhythm and treat
accordingly.6
Diff erential diagnosis (See p128.)
• Ventricular tachycardia (VT) including torsade de pointes. Single ventricular
ectopics should not cause confusion; if >3 together at a rate >100, this is VT.
• SVT (p806) with aberrant conduction, eg AF or atrial fl utter, with bundle branch block.
• Pre-excited tachycardias, eg AF, atrial fl utter, or AV re-entry tachycardia, with un-
derlying WPW (p133).
Identifying the underlying rhythm (See p128.) If in doubt, treat as VT.
Management See fi g 19.9.6
• Connect patient to a cardiac monitor and have a defi brillator to hand.
• Monitor O2 sats and if <90% give supplemental oxygen.
• Correct electrolyte abnormalities, esp K+ and Mg2+.
• Check for adverse signs. Low cardiac output (clammy, consciousness, BP <90);
oliguria; angina; pulmonary oedema.
• Obtain 12-lead ECG (request CXR) and obtain IV access.
If haemodynamically unstable VT: Synchronized DC shock (see p894, fi g A3).
• Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h,
and 4mL 50% magnesium sulfate over 30min both via central line.
• Follow with amiodarone 300mg IV over 10–20min (peripherally only in emergency).
• For refractory cases consider procainamide or sotalol.
If haemodynamically stable VT: Correct hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: as above.
• Amiodarone 300mg IV over 20–60min (avoid if long QT) via central line.
• If this fails, use synchronized DC shock.
After correction of VT: Establish the cause (via the history and tests described above).
• Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give
IV amiodarone infusion for 12–24h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic:
sotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function).
• Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an
implantable cardioverter defi brillator (ICD) may help.
Ventricular fi brillation: (ECG p129, fi g 3.29) Use non-synchronized DC shock (there is
no R wave to trigger defi brillation, p770): see p894, fi g A3.
If SVT with aberrant conduction: Manage as SVT with eg adenosine (see p806).
Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics): These are the commonest post-MI arrhyth-
mia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent
ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhyth-
mic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.
Torsade de pointes: A form of VT, with a constantly varying axis, often in the setting
of long QT syndromes (ECG p129, fi g 3.31). Causes (p711): congenital or from drugs (eg
some antidysrhythmics, tricyclics, antimalarials, antipsychotics). Torsade in the set-
ting of congenital long-QT syndromes can be treated with high doses of -blockers.
In acquired long-QT syndromes (p711), stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypo-
kalaemia, and give magnesium sulfate (2g IV over 10min). Alternatives include: over-
drive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or isoprenaline IVI to increase
heart rate.

Narrow complex tachycardia
ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms (<3 small squares on
ECGs done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s).
Diff erential diagnosis (See p126.)
• Sinus tachycardia: Normal P wave followed by normal QRS—not an arrhythmia! Do
not attempt to cardiovert; if necessary (ie not a physiological response to fever/
hypovolaemia) rate control with -blockers.
• Atrial tachyarrhythmias: Rhythm arises in atria, AV node is a bystander.
• Atrial fi brillation (AF): absent P wave, irregular QRS complexes.
• Atrial fl utter: atrial rate ~260–340bpm. Sawtooth baseline, due to a re-entrant
circuit usually in the right atrium. Ventricular rate often 150bpm (2:1 block).
• Atrial tachycardia: abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS.
• Multifocal atrial tachycardia: ≥3 P-wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes.
• Junctional tachycardia: AV node is part of the pathway. P wave either buried in QRS
complex or occurring after QRS complex.
• AV nodal re-entry tachycardia.
• AV re-entry tachycardia, includes an accessory pathway, eg WPW (p133).
Management Be guided by patient status,6 see fi g 19.10.6
If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion.
• Otherwise, identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly. The most impor-
tant thing is to decide whether the rhythm is regular or not (irregular is likely AF).
• Vagal manoeuvres (carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre) transiently in-
crease AV block, and may unmask an underlying atrial rhythm.
• If unsuccessful, give adenosine, which causes transient AV block. It has a short half-
life (10–15s) and works by: 1 transiently slowing ventricles to show the underlying
atrial rhythm; 2 cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm.
Adenosine: Consult BNF if on dipyridamole or has had a heart transplant. Give 6mg
IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline fl ush, while recording a rhythm
strip. If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg, then one further 12mg bolus. Warn about
SE: transient chest tightness, dyspnoea, headache, fl ushing. Relative CI: Asthma,
2nd/3rd-degree AV block or sinoatrial disease (unless pacemaker). Interactions: Po-
tentiated by dipyridamole; antagonized by theophylline.
Specifi cs Sinus tachycardia: Identify and treat underlying cause.
Supraventricular tachycardia: If adenosine fails, use verapamil 2.5–5mg IV over
2min. NB: NOT if on a -blocker. If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age
<60yrs). Alternatives: atenolol 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given;
or amiodarone. If unsuccessful, use DC cardioversion.
Atrial fi brillation/fl utter: Manage with rate control; seek help if resistant (p130).
Atrial tachycardia: Rare; may be due to digoxin toxicity: withdraw digoxin, consider
digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments. Maintain K+ at 4–5mmol/L.
Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Most commonly occurs in COPD. Correct hypoxia and
hypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm.
Junctional tachycardia: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node oc-
curs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junc-
tional rhythm to sinus rhythm. If it fails or recurs, -blockers (or verapamil—not
with -blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine). If this does not control
symptoms, consider radiofrequency ablation.
Seek specialist advice if resistant junction tachycardia, or accessory pathway.
Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (ECG p133, fi g 3.37.) Caused by congenital
accessory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short
PR interval and widened QRS complex due to slurred upstroke or ‘delta wave’. Two
types: WPW type A (+ve  wave in V1), WPW type B (–ve  wave in V1). Present with SVT
which may be due to an AVRT (p126), pre-excited AF, or pre-excited atrial fl utter. Risk of
degeneration to VF and sudden death. : Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodar-
one. Refer to cardiologist for electrophysiology and ablation of the accessory pathway.

Bradycardia is defi ned as a heart rate <60bpm. This may be normal and asympto-
matic in very fi t, young individuals whose high stroke volumes will maintain ad-
equate cardiac output at low heart rates.
Symptoms Often asymptomatic. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness. The presence of synco-
pe, chest pain, or breathlessness is concerning and suggests the presence of adverse
signs; sudden cardiac death can occur.
Rhythm The immediate management tends to relate more to cause and adverse
signs than to the underlying rhythm, which may be •sinus bradycardia •heart block
(see p98) •AF with a slow ventricular response •atrial fl utter with a high-degree
block •junctional bradycardia.
Causes
• Physiological: Heart rates as low as 40bpm at rest and 30bpm in sleep can be ac-
cepted in asymptomatic trained athletes.
• Cardiac:
• Degenerative changes causing fi brosis of conduction pathways (risk in elderly
patients; may have previous ECGs showing bundle branch block or 1st- or 2nd-
degree heart block).
• Post-MI—particularly after an inferior MI (the right coronary artery supplies the
sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node in most people).
• Sick sinus syndrome (p125).
• Iatrogenic—ablation, surgery.
• Aortic valve disease, eg infective endocarditis (p150; do daily ECGs looking for
heart block).
• Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, amyloid, sarcoid, SLE.
• Non-cardiac origin:
• Vasovagal—very common (p460).
• Endocrine—hypothyroidism, adrenal insuffi ciency.
• Metabolic—hyperkalaemia, hypoxia.
• Other—hypothermia, ICP (Cushing’s triad: bradycardia, hypertension, and ir-
regular breathing:  urgent senior input needed).
• Drug-induced:
• -blockers, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin.
Management Follow a logical approach,6 see fi g 19.11. 6
Think ahead. If you may need an anaesthetist to sedate the patient for transcuta-
neous pacing, or a cardiologist for transvenous pacing, call them now.
• Perform a 12-lead ECG, check electrolytes (including K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), do digoxin levels.
• Connect patient to cardiac monitor/telemetry.
• Address the cause: correct metabolic defects; if the patient has adverse signs or is
deteriorating, give antidotes to medicines likely to have caused the bradycardia (eg
glucagon if -blocker overdose).
• If the patient has adverse signs or risk of asystole, give atropine (not to be given if
patient has a transplanted heart).
• If atropine is insuffi cient and adverse signs persist, transcutaneous pacing should
be considered (p777). If this cannot be initiated immediately (eg waiting for an
anaesthetist), consider other medications such as isoprenaline infusion.
• Remember electrical ‘capture’ with transcutaneous pacing does not guarantee me-
chanical ‘capture’. Once pacing is established, check the patient’s pulse.
It is possible to have two patients sat next to each other with identical bradycardic
ECG tracings, one of whom is peri-arrest, the other is sat comfortably and cannot
understand your concern. The clinical state is more important than the numbers
on the screen.

Acute severe asthma
The severity of an attack is easily underestimated.
An atmosphere of calm helps.
Presentation Acute breathlessness and wheeze.
History (See p48.) Ask about usual and recent treatment; previous acute episodes and
their severity and best peak expiratory fl ow rate (PEF). Have they been admitted to ICU?
Diff erential diagnosis Acute infective exacerbation of COPD, pulmonary oedema,
upper respiratory tract obstruction, pulmonary embolus, anaphylaxis.
Investigations PEF—but may be too ill; ABG if saturations <92% or life-threatening fea-
tures; CXR (if suspicion of pneumothorax, infection or life-threatening attack); FBC; U&E.
Assessing the severity of an acute asthma attack
Severe attack:
• Unable to complete sentences in one breath.
• Respiratory rate ≥ 25/min.
• Pulse rate ≥110 beats/min.
• PEF 33–50% of predicted or best.
Life-threatening attack:
• PEF <33% of predicted or best.
• Silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory eff ort.
• Arrhythmia or hypotension.
• Exhaustion, confusion, or coma.
• Arterial blood gases:
• Normal/high PaCO2 >4.6kPa.
• PaO2 <8kPa, or SaO2 <92%.
Management Rapid treatment and reassessment is key,7 see fi g 19.12.
• Salbutamol 5mg nebulized with oxygen and give prednisolone 30mg PO.
• If PEF remains <75%, repeat salbutamol; add ipratropium.
• Monitor oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
• Admit all with severe features not responding to initial treatment or with life-
threatening features.
NB: the routine use of antibiotics is not recommended in exacerbations of asthma.
Discharge Patients with PEF >75% within 1h of initial treatment can be discharged if
no other reason to admit. Otherwise, before discharge patients must have:
• been stable on discharge medication for 24h
• had inhaler technique checked
• peak fl ow rate >75% predicted or best with diurnal variability <25%
• steroid (inhaled and oral) and bronchodilator therapy
• their own PEF meter and have written management plan
• GP appointment within 2d
• respiratory clinic appointment within 4wks.
Drugs used in acute asthma
Salbutamol (2-agonist). SE: tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, K+.
Hydrocortisone and prednisolone (steroid; reduces infl ammation).
Aminophylline is used much less frequently and is not routinely recommended in
current BTS guidelines, but may be initiated by respiratory team or ICU. It inhibits
phosphodiesterase; [cAMP]. SE: pulse, arrhythmias, nausea, seizures. The amount
of IVI aminophylline may need altering according to the individual patient: al-
ways check the BNF. Monitor ECG. Aim for plasma concentration of 10–20mcg/mL
(55–110μmol/L). Serious toxi city (BP arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) can occur at con-
centrations ≥25mcg/mL. Measure plasma K+: theophyllines may cause K+. Don’t load
patients already on oral preparations. Stick with one brand (bioavailability varies).

Acute exacerbations of COPD
A common medical emergency especially in winter. May be triggered by viral or
bacterial infections.
Presentation Increasing cough, breathlessness, or wheeze. Decreased exercise
capacity.
History (See p48.) Ask about usual/recent treatments (especially home oxygen),
smoking status, and exercise capacity (may infl uence a decision to ventilate the
patient).
Diff erential diagnosis Asthma, pulmonary oedema, upper respiratory tract ob-
struction, pulmonary embolus, anaphylaxis.
Investigations
• ABG (p771).
• CXR to exclude pneumothorax and infection.
• FBC; U&E; CRP. Theophylline level if patient on therapy at home.
• ECG.
• Send sputum for culture if purulent.
• Blood cultures if pyrexial.
Management Ensure oxygenation then treat the reversible,8 see fi g 19.13.
• Look for a cause, eg infection, pneumothorax.
• Prior to discharge, liaise with GP regarding steroid reduction, domiciliary oxygen
(p184), smoking cessation, and pneumococcal and fl u vaccinations (p166).
Treatment of stable COPD and more advanced disease: See pp184–5.
Consider the ceiling of care: What is in the best interests of the patient? Invasive
ventilation for exacerbations of COPD may not be appropriate: it can be diffi cult to
wean patients off ventilatory support, and brings with it the risk of ventilator-asso-
ciated pneumonias and pneumothoraces from ruptured bullae. If possible, speak to
the patient early, before deterioration, try to ascertain their wishes. Patients who
have previously been ventilated may not wish to repeat the experience. Consider
comorbidities, FEV1, functional status, whether the patient requires home oxygen,
and whether the patient has previously been admitted to ICU (and if so, whether they
were easily weaned from invasive ventilation). Involve the patient, the family, your
seniors, and ICU early in making a decision.
Oxygen therapy
• The greatest danger is hypoxia, which probably accounts for more deaths than
hypercapnia. Don’t leave patients severely hypoxic.
• However, in some patients, who rely on their hypoxic drive to breathe, too much
oxygen may lead to a reduced respiratory rate and hypercapnia, with a consequent
fall in conscious level. Always prescribe O2 as if it were a drug.
• Care is always required with O2, especially if there is evidence of CO2 retention.
Start with 24–28% O2 in such patients.
 Whenever you initiate or change oxygen therapy, do consider an ABG within 1h.
• Monitor the patient carefully. Aim to raise the PaO2 above 8.0kPa with a rise in
PaCO2 <1.5kPa.
• In patients without evidence of retention at baseline use 28–40% O2, but still
monitor and repeat ABG.

 Management of acute COPD 813
Nebulized bronchodilators:
Salbutamol 5mg/4h and ipratropium 500mcg/6h
Investigate: CXR, ABG
Controlled oxygen therapy if SaO2 <88% or PaO2 <7 kPa:
Start at 24–28%, aim sats 88–92%
Adjust according to ABG, aim PaO2 >8.0kPa with a rise in PaCO2 <1.5kPa
Steroids:
IV hydrocortisone 200mg and oral prednisolone
30mg OD (continue for 7–14d)
Antibiotics:
Use if evidence of infection, eg amoxicillin 500mg/8h PO,
alternatively clarithromycin or doxycycline (p387)
Physiotherapy to aid sputum expectoration
If no response to nebulizers and steroids:
Consider IV aminophylline*
If no response:
1 Consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation† (NIPPV) if
respiratory rate >30 or pH <7.35, or PaCO2 rising despite best
medical treatment. OR:
2 Consider a respiratory stimulant drug, eg doxapram1 .5–4mg/
min IV in patients who are not suitable for mechanical ventila-
tion. SE: agitation, confusion, tachycardia, nausea. It is a
short-term measure, used only if NIV is not available
Consider intubation and ventilation if pH <7.26 and PaCO2 is rising
despite non-invasive ventilation only where appropriate (see
‘Consider the ceiling of care’ in text)
*Load with 250mg over 20min, then infuse at a rate of ~500mcg/kg/h (300mcg/kg/h if elderly), where kg is
ideal body weight. Do not give a loading dose to patients on maintenance methylxanthines (theophyllines/
aminophylline; see p811). Check plasma levels if given for >24h. ECG monitoring is required.
†This may alone serve as a rescue therapy, be an intermittent step before ventilation, or be considered as a
‘ceiling of therapy’ for those deemed not suitable for mechanical ventilation.

Pneumothorax
Causes
• Spontaneous: (Especially in young thin men) due to rupture of a subpleural bulla.
• Chronic lung disease: Asthma; COPD; cystic fi brosis; lung fi brosis; sarcoidosis.
• Infection: TB; pneumonia; lung abscess.
• Traumatic: Including iatrogenic (CVP line insertion, pleural aspiration or biopsy,
percutaneous liver biopsy, positive pressure ventilation).
• Carcinoma.
• Connective tissue disorders: Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
Clinical features
Symptoms: Can be asymptomatic (especially in fi t young people with small pneu-
mothoraces) or sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Patients with
asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically ventilated
patients can suddenly develop hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures.
Signs: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath
sounds on the aff ected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi-
ated away from the aff ected side and the patient will be very unwell.
Tests A CXR should not be performed if a tension pneumothorax is suspected, as
it will delay immediate necessary treatment. Otherwise, request an expiratory fi lm,
and look for an area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to the edge of the collapsed
lung (see p725). Ensure the suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous
bulla. Check ABG in dyspnoeic/hypoxic patients and those with chronic lung disease.
Management See fi g 19.14. Depends on whether it is a primary pneumothorax
or secondary (=underlying lung disease or smoker >50yrs old), size, and symptoms.9
• Size is measured from the visible lung margin to chest wall at level of the hilum.
• Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires a chest drain.
• Aspiration of a pneumothorax, see p767.
• Insertion and management of a chest drain, see p766. Use a small tube (10–14F)
unless blood/pus is also present. Tubes may be removed 24h after the lung has re-
expanded and air leak has stopped (ie the tube stops bubbling). This is done during
expiration or a Valsalva manoeuvre.
Surgical advice: Arrange if: bilateral pneumothoraces; lung fails to expand within
48h of intercostal drain insertion; persistent air leak; two or more previous pneumo-
thoraces on the same side; or history of pneumothorax on the opposite side.
Tension pneumothorax
 This is a medical emergency. (See fi g 16.43, p749.)
Essence Air drawn into the pleural space with each inspiration has no route of
escape during expiration. The mediastinum is pushed over into the contralateral
hemithorax, kinking and compressing the great veins. Unless the air is rapidly re-
moved, cardiorespiratory arrest will occur.
Signs Respiratory distress, tachycardia, hypotension, distended neck veins, trachea
deviated away from side of pneumothorax. Increased percussion note, reduced air
entry/breath sounds on the aff ected side.
Treatment
To remove the air, insert a large-bore (14–16G) needle with a syringe, partially fi lled
with 0.9% saline, into the 2nd intercostal interspace in the midclavicular line on the
side of the suspected pneumothorax. Remove plunger to allow the trapped air to
bubble through the syringe (with saline as a water seal) until a chest tube can be
placed. Alternatively, insert a large-bore Venfl on in the same location.
 Do this before requesting a CXR.
 Then insert a chest drain. See p766.

Pneumonia
An infection of the lung parenchyma. Incidence of community-acquired pneumonia
is 5–11 per 1000 adults. Of these, 1–3 per 1000 will require hospitalization, and mortal-
ity in those hospitalized is up to 14%.
Common organisms
• Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause (60–75%).
• Haemophilus infl uenzae.
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
• Staphylococcus aureus found more commonly in ICU patients.
• Legionella species and Chlamydia psittaci.
• Gram-negative bacilli, often hospital-acquired or immunocompromised, eg Pseudo-
monas, especially in those with COPD.
• Viruses including infl uenza account for up to 15%.
Symptoms Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, purulent sputum
(classically ‘rusty’ with pneumococcus), haemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain.
Signs Fever, cyanosis, herpes labialis (pneumococcus), confusion, tachypnoea,
tachy cardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (diminished expansion, dull percus-
sion note,  tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), pleural rub.
Management Ensure oxygenation then identify and treat reversible pathology,10
see fi g 19.15.
Investigations: Assess severity—this will guide both investigation and treatment.
• CXR (X-ray images, fi g 16.4 on p725).
• Oxygen saturation and ABG if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia.
• FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP.
• Blood cultures (if CURB-65 ≥2).
• Sputum cultures (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if CURB-65 =2 and not had antibiotics yet).
• Urine pneumococcal antigen (if CURB-65 ≥2); Legionella antigen (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if
clinical suspicion).
• Consider need for viral throat swabs and mycoplasma PCR/serology.
• Pleural fl uid may be aspirated for culture (if CURB-65 ≥2).
• Consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if the patient is immunocom-
promised or on ICU.
Severity: Calculate the core adverse features ‘CURB-65’ score: •Confusion (abbrevi-
ated mental test ≤8). •Urea >7mmol/L. •Respiratory rate ≥30/min. •BP <90/60mmHg.
•Age ≥65. Score: 0–1: home treatment if possible; ≥2: hospital therapy; ≥3: indicates
severe pneumonia and should consider ICU referral.
Other features increasing the risk of death are: coexisting disease; bilateral/multi-
lobar involvement; PaO2 <8kPa or SaO2 <92%.
Treatment: See antibiotic guidance (table 4.2 on p167). Most patients who require IV
antibiotics can safely be switched to PO therapy by day 3.
Complications (Of infection or treatment.) Pleural eff usion, empyema, lung abscess,
respiratory failure, septicaemia, pericarditis, myocarditis, cholestatic jaundice, acute
kidney injury.

Assess for dehydration (common if acutely unwell
and fever), consider IV fl uid support
Investigations:
See p816
Antibiotics:
See p167
Analgesia for pleuritic chest pain, eg paracetamol 1g/6h or NSAID
No improvement?
If hypoxic despite oxygen, consider CPAP to recruit lung paren-
chyma and improve oxygenation. But if patient is hypercapnic,
they will require non-invasive or invasive (ie intubation) ventilation

Pulmonary embolism (PE)
Always suspect pulmonary embolism (PE) in sudden collapse 1–2wks after surgery.
Mechanism Venous thrombi, usually from DVT, pass into the pulmonary circula-
tion and block blood fl ow to lungs. The source is often occult.
Risk factors
• Malignancy; myeloproliferative disorder; antiphospholipid syndrome.
• Surgery—especially pelvic and lower limb (much lower if prophylaxis used).
• Immobility; active infl ammation (eg infection, IBD).
• Pregnancy; combined OCP; HRT.
• Previous thromboembolism and inherited thrombophilia, see p374.
Signs and symptoms
• Acute dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, and syncope.
• Hypotension, tachycardia, gallop rhythm, JVP, loud P2, right ventricular heave,
pleural rub, tachypnoea, cyanosis, AF.
With thromboprophylaxis, PE following surgery is far less common, but PE may oc-
cur after any period of immobility, or with no predisposing factors. Breathlessness
may be the only sign. Multiple small emboli may present less dramatically with
pleuritic pain, haemoptysis, and gradually increasing breathlessness. Look for a
source of emboli—especially DVT (is a leg swollen?).
Investigations Risk stratify based upon clinical features (use 2-level Wells’ score
for PE—p191). A Ωve D-dimer in a low-probability patient eff ective excludes PE.11
• U&E, FBC, baseline clotting.
• ECG: commonly normal or sinus tachycardia; right ventricular strain pattern V1–V3
(p98), right axis deviation, RBBB, AF, may be deep S waves in I, Q waves in III, in-
verted T waves in III (‘SI QIII TIII’).
• CXR: often normal; decreased vascular markings, small pleural eff usion. Wedge-
shaped area of infarction. Atelectasis.
• ABG: hyperventilation + poor gas exchange: PaO2, PaCO2, pH.
• Serum D-dimer: low specifi city ( if thrombosis, infl ammation, post-op, infection,
malignancy)  check only in patients with low pre-test probability (p191).
• CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is sensitive and specifi c and is the test of
choice for high-risk patients or low-risk patients with a +ve D-dimer. If unavaila-
ble, a ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan can aid diagnosis but frequently produces
equivocal results
Management See fi g 19.16 for immediate management.11
If good story and signs, make the diagnosis. Start treatment (fi g 19.16) before
defi nitive investigations: most PE deaths occur within 1h.
• Commence LMWH or fondaparinux.
• If there is haemodynamic instability, consider thromolysis.
• Long-term anticoagulation: either DOAC (p350—switch directly from LMWH) or
warfarin (continue LMWH until INR >2).
• Is there an underlying cause, eg thrombophilia (p374), SLE, or polycythaemia? Con-
sider malignancy (take a careful history and perform a full physical examination;
check CXR, FBC, LFT, Ca2+; urinalysis; consider CT abdomen/pelvis and mammogram).
• If obvious remedial cause, 3 months of anticoagulation (p351) may be enough;
otherwise, continue for ≥3–6 months (long term if recurrent emboli, or
underlying malignancy).
Prevention See p190.

Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding
Causes
• Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) 35–50%.
• Gastroduodenal erosions 8–15%.
• Oesophagitis 5–15%.
• Mallory–Weiss tear 15%.
• Varices 5–10%.
• Other: upper GI malignancy, vascular malformations. Consider also facial trauma,
nose bleed, or haemoptysis as causes of swallowed blood.
Signs and symptoms (See pp56–63.) Haematemesis, or melaena, dizziness (espe-
cially postural), fainting, abdominal pain, dysphagia? Hypotension (in young may be
postural only), tachyc ardia (not if on -blocker), JVP, urine output, cool and clammy,
signs of chronic liver disease (p276), eg telangiectasia, purpura, jaundice. NB: ask
about previous GI problems, drug use, alcohol.
Management Focus on circulation,12 see fi g 19.17. Risk stratify based upon, eg
Rockall score (see table 6.6, p257).
Is the patient shocked?
• Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refi ll time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h.
• GCS or encephalopathy (p275).
• Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm).
• Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg.
If shocked: See fi g 19.17 for management.
If haemodynamically stable:
• Insert two large-bore (14–16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting,
and group & save.
• Give IV fl uids (p821) to restore intravascular volume; avoid saline if cirrhotic/
varices; consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fl uid replacement.
• Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.
• Consider a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.
• Transfuse if signifi cant Hb drop (<70g/L).
• Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).
• If suspicion of varices (eg known history of liver disease or alcohol excess) then
give terlipressin IV (1–2mg/6h for ≤3d) and initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics
(eg piperacillin/tazobactam IV 4.5g/8h).
• Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH20) at least hourly until stable.
• Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).
• If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/embo-
lization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, a Seng-
staken–Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by
someone with experience.
Acute drug therapy: There is no role for routine administration of PPI pre-endoscopy
(provided endoscopy can be arranged in a timely manner). In patients undergoing
successful endoscopic haemostasis, give PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO). Treat if
positive for H. pylori (p253).
Rebleeds Serious event: 40% of patients who rebleed will die. If ‘at risk’ maintain
a high index of suspicion. If a rebleed occurs, check vital signs every 15min and call
senior cover for repeat endoscopy and/or surgical intervention.
Signs of a rebleed:
• Rising pulse rate.
• Falling JVP ± decreasing hourly urine output.
• Haematemesis or ‘fresh’ melaena (NB: it is normal to pass decreasing amounts of
melaena for 24h post-haemostasis, as blood makes its way through the GI tract).
• Fall in BP (a late and sinister fi nding) and decreased conscious level.

Management See fi g 19.19; investigations and treatment proceed in parallel.13
• If  ICP, summon help immediately and inform ICU.
• Initiate early antibiotics. Take blood cultures fi rst. Then perform LP prior to an-
tibiotics only in patients where no evidence of shock, petechial rash or ICP and
where able to obtain LP within 1h (table 19.4). Consult local policies and seek ad-
vice. Empirical options include ceftriaxone 2g/12h IV; add eg amoxicillin 2g/4h IV if
>60yrs age or immunocompromised. If suspect viral encephalitis see p824.
• If features of menigism give dexamethasone 10mg/6h IV
• Other investigations, U&E, FBC (WBC ≈ immunocompromise: get help), LFT, glucose,
coagulation. Throat swabs (1 for bacteria, 1 for virology). CXR. Consider HIV, TB tests.
• Prophylaxis (discuss with public health/ID): •Household contacts in droplet range.
•Those who have kissed the patient’s mouth. Give ciprofl oxacin (500mg PO, 1 dose;
child 5–12yrs: 250mg; child <5yrs: 30mg/kg to max 125mg).

Encephalitis
Suspect encephalitis whenever odd behaviour, consciousness, focal neurology
or seizure is preceded by an infectious prodrome (T°, rash, lymphadenopathy, cold
sores, conjunctivitis, meningeal signs). It is often wise to treat (see below) before the
exact cause is known—usually viral, and often never identifi ed. Without the infec-
tious prodrome consider encephalopathy: hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy,
diabetic ketoacidosis, drugs, hypoxic brain injury, uraemia, SLE, Wernicke’s (give vit
B1 if in doubt p714).
Signs and symptoms
• Bizarre encephalopathic behaviour or confusion.
• GCS or coma.
• Fever.
• Headache.
• Focal neurological signs.
• Seizures.
• History of travel or animal bite.
Causes
• Viral: HSV-1 & 2, arboviruses, CMV, EBV, VZV (varicella-zoster virus), HIV (seroconver-
sion), measles, mumps, rabies, Japanese B encephalitis, West Nile virus, tick-borne
encephalitis.
• Non-viral: Any bacterial meningitis, TB, malaria, listeria, Lyme disease, legionella,
leptospirosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, schistosomiasis, typhus.
Investigations
• Bloods: Blood cultures; serum for viral PCR (also throat swab and MSU); toxoplasma
IgM titre; malaria fi lm.
• Contrast-enhanced CT: Focal bilateral temporal lobe involvement is suggestive of
HSV encephalitis. Meningeal enhancement suggests meningoencephalitis. Do be-
fore LP. MRI is alternative if allergic to contrast.
• LP: Typically moderately CSF protein and lymphocytes, and glucose (p822). Send
CSF for viral PCR including HSV.
• EEG: Urgent EEG showing diff use abnormalities may help confi rm a diagnosis of
encephalitis, but does not indicate a cause.
Management
Mortality in untreated viral encephalitis is ~70%. Aim to start aciclovir within
30min of the patient arriving (10mg/kg/8h IV over 1h) for 14d as empirical treat-
ment for HSV (21d if immunosuppressed). Specifi c therapies also exist for CMV and
toxoplasmosis (p425).
• Supportive therapy, in high-dependency unit or ICU environment if necessary.
• Symptomatic treatment: eg phenytoin for seizures (p826).
Cerebral abscess
Suspect this in any patient with ICP, especially if there is fever or WCC. It may follow
ear, sinus, dental, or periodontal infection; skull fracture; congenital heart disease;
endocarditis; bronchiectasis. It may also occur in the absence of systemic signs of
infl ammation.
Signs Seizures, fever, localizing signs, or signs of ICP. Coma. Signs of sepsis else-
where (eg teeth, ears, lungs, endocarditis).
Investigations CT/MRI p746 (eg ‘ring-enhancing’ lesion); WCC, ESR; biopsy.
Treatment Urgent neurosurgical referral; treat ICP (p830). If frontal sinuses or
teeth are the source, the likely organism will be Strep. milleri (microaerophilic),
or oropharyngeal anaerobes. In ear abscesses, B. fragilis or other anaerobes are
most common. Bacterial abscesses are often peripheral; toxoplasma lesions (p425)
are deeper (eg basal ganglia). NB: ask yourself: is the patient immunocompromised?
Discuss with infectious diseases/microbiology.

Status epilepticus
This means seizures lasting for >30min, or repeated seizures without intervening
consciousness. Mortality and the risk of permanent brain damage increase with the
length of attack. Aim to terminate seizures lasting more than a few minutes as soon
as possible (<20min).
Status usually occurs in patients with known epilepsy. If it is the 1st presentation,
the chance of a structural brain lesion is high (>50%). Diagnosis of tonic–clonic status
is usually clear. Non-convulsive status (eg absence status or continuous partial sei-
zures with preservation of consciousness) may be more diffi cult: look for subtle eye
or lid movement. For other signs, see pp484, 490–3. An EEG can be very helpful. Could
the patient be pregnant (any pelvic mass)? If so, eclampsia (OHCS p48) is the likely
diagnosis, check the urine and BP: call a senior obstetrician—immediate delivery may
be needed.
Investigations
• Bedside glucose, the following tests can be done once  has started: lab glucose,
ABG, U&E, Ca2+, FBC, ECG.
• Consider anticonvulsant levels, toxicology screen, LP, culture blood and urine, EEG,
CT, carbon monoxide level.
• Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor.
Management See fi g 19.20. Basic life support—and these agents:14
1 Lorazepam: 0.1mg/kg (usually 4mg) as a slow bolus into a large vein. If no re-
sponse after 10–20min give a second dose. Beware respiratory arrest during the
last part of the injection. Have full resuscitation facilities to hand for all IV benzodi-
azepine use. The rectal route is an alternative for diazepam if IV access is diffi cult.
Buccal midazolam is an easier to use oral alternative where no IV access (eg in
a community setting); dose for those 10yrs old and older 10mg; if 1–5yrs 5mg, if
5–10yrs 7 . 5mg; squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on
each side. While waiting for this to work, prepare other drugs. If fi ts continue …
2 Phenytoin infusion: 15–18mg/kg IVI (roughly 1g if 60kg, and 1 . 5g if 80kg; max 2g),
at a maximum rate of 50mg/min (don’t put diazepam in same line: they don’t mix).
Beware BP and do not use if bradycardic or heart block. Requires BP and ECG
monitoring. 100mg/6–8h is a maintenance dose (check levels). If fi ts continue …
3 SeekI CU help: Paralysis and anaesthesia with eg propofol is required. Close moni-
toring, especially respiratory function, is vital. Consider whether this could be
pseudoseizures (p490), particularly if there are odd features (pelvic thrusts; resist-
ing attempts to open lids and your attempts to do passive movements; arms and
legs fl ailing around).
4 Dexamethasone: 10mg IV if vasculitis/cerebral oedema (tumour) possible.
As soon as seizures are controlled, start oral drugs (p492). Ask what the cause was,
eg hypoglycaemia, pregnancy, alcohol, drugs, CNS lesion or infection, hypertensive
encephalopathy, inadequate anticonvulsant dose/compliance (p490).

 Management of convulsive status epilepticus 827
Open and secure the airway (adjuncts as necessary)
Remove false teeth if poorly fi tting
Oxygen, 100% + suction (as required)
IV access and take blood:
U&E, LFT, FBC, glucose, Ca2+
Toxicology screen if indicated
Anticonvulsant levels
IV bolus—to stop seizures: eg lorazepam 4mg
Give 2nd dose of lorazepam if no response after 10–20min
Thiamine 250mg IV over 30min if alcoholism or
malnourishment suspected
Glucose 50mL 50% IV, unless glucose known to be normal
Treat acidosis if severe (contact ICU)
Correct hypotension with fl uids
IV infusion: If seizures continue, start phenytoin,
15–18mg/kg IVI, at a rate of 50mg/min. Monitor ECG and BP.
100mg/6–8h is a maintenance dose (check levels)
General anaesthesia: Continuing seizures after 60–90mins of above
therapies require expert help with paralysis (eg propofol infusion) and
ventilation with continuous EEG monitoring in ICU. NB: never spend longer
than 20min on someone with status epilepticus without having help at the
bedside from an anaesthetist

Head injury
If the pupils are unequal, diagnose rising intracranial pressure (ICP), eg from ex-
tradural haemorrhage, and summon urgent neurosurgical help (p482). Retinal vein
pulsation at fundoscopy helps exclude ICP.
Initial management See fi g 19.21. Write full notes. Record times.
Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) remains the 1st priority. If
GCS ≤8 then seek urgent anaesthetic and ICU help to protect airway.15
• Involve neurosurgeons early, especially if GCS, or if ICP suspected.
• Examine the CNS. Chart pulse, BP, T°, respirations + pupils every 15min.
• Assess anterograde amnesia (loss from the time of injury, ie post-traumatic) and
retrograde amnesia (for events prior to injury)—extent of retrograde loss corre-
lates with severity of injury, and never occurs without anterograde amnesia.
• Nurse semi-prone if no spinal injury; meticulous care to airway and bladder.
Perform a CT head <1h if:
• GCS <13 on initial assessment, or GCS <15 at 2h following injury.
• Focal neurological defi cit.
• Suspected open or depressed skull fracture, or signs of basal skull fracture: perio-
bital ecchymoses (‘panda’ eyes/racoon sign), postauricular ecchymosis (Battle’s
sign), CSF leak through nose/ears, haemotympanum.
• Post-traumatic seizure.
• Vomiting more than once.
Perform a CT head <8h if: Any loss of consciousness or amnesia AND any of: •age ≥65
•coagulopathy •high-impact injury, eg struck by or ejected from motor vehicle; fall
>1m or >5 stairs •retrograde amnesia of >30min.
Suspected cervical spine injuries: Perform a CT cervical spine <1h if:
• GCS <13 on initial assessment.
• The patient has been intubated.
• Defi nitive diagnosis of cervical spine injury is needed urgently (eg before surgery).
• The patient is having other body areas scanned, eg multi-region trauma.
• Clinical suspicion of cervical spine injury AND ANY OF: •age 65 years or older •high-
impact injury •focal neurological defi cit •paraesthesia in the upper or lower limbs.
If above-listed criteria are NOT met AND IF ANY OF the following low-risk features
are present, then assess neck movement: •simple rear-end motor vehicle collision
•comfortable in a sitting position •ambulatory since injury •no midline cervical spine
tenderness •delayed onset of neck pain. If patient unable actively to rotate neck 45°
to left and right or if a low-risk feature not present, then obtain plain X-rays of cer-
vical spine <1h. If X-rays technically inadequate, suspicious, or defi nitely abnormal,
proceed to CT.
Admit if: •new, clinically signifi cant abnormalities on CT •GCS<15 after CT, regardless
of result or continuing worrying signs (eg vomiting) •when CT indications met but
CT unavailable •other concerns (eg drugs or alcohol, other injuries, CSF leak, shock,
suspected non-accidental injury, meningism).
Do not attribute GCS to alcohol until a signifi cant head injury has been excluded.
Alcohol is an unlikely cause of coma if plasma alcohol <44mmol/L. If unavailable, es-
timate blood alcohol level from the osmolar gap (p668). If blood alcohol ≈ 40mmol/L,
osmolar gap ≈ 40mmol/L.
Discuss with neurosurgical unit all with signifi cant abnormalities on CT or with
eg persistent GCS ≤8 or deteriorating GCS (especially motor component), persistent
confusion, progressive focal neurology, seizure without full recovery, penetrating
injuries, or CSF leak. If transfer is required, ensure skilled medical escort and consider
need for intubation prior to transfer.
Complications Early: Extradural/subdural haemorrhage, seizures. Late: Subdural
(p482), seizures, diabetes insipidus, parkinsonism, dementia.
Indicators of a bad prognosis Old age, decerebrate rigidity, extensor spasms,
prolonged coma, BP, PaO2 (on blood gases), T° >39°C. 60% of those with loss of
consciousness of >1 month will survive 3–25yrs, but may need daily nursing care.

Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)
The volume inside the cranium is fi xed, so any increase in the contents can lead to
raised ICP. This can be mass eff ect, oedema, or obstruction to fl uid outfl ow. Normal
ICP in adults is <15mmHg.
Causes
• Primary or metastatic tumours.
• Head injury.
• Haemorrhage (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular).
• Infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess.
• Hydrocephalus.
• Cerebral oedema.
• Status epilepticus.
Signs and symptoms
• Headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting.
• Altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma.
• History of trauma.
• HR and BP (Cushing’s response); Cheyne–Stokes respiration.
• Pupil changes (constriction at fi rst, later dilation—do not mask these signs by using
agents such as tropicamide to dilate the pupil to aid fundoscopy).
• Visual acuity; peripheral visual fi eld loss.
• Papilloedema is an unreliable sign, but venous pulsation at the disc may be absent
(absent in ~50% of normal people, but loss of it is a useful sign).
Investigations
• U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture.
• Consider toxicology screen.
• CXR—any source of infection that might indicate abscess?
• CT head.
• Then consider LP if safe. Measure the opening pressure!
Management See fi g 19.22. The goal is to ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent
neurosurgery is required for the defi nitive treatment of ICP from focal causes (eg
haematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or
bolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in fi g 19.22.
Herniation syndromes
Uncal herniation is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsi-
lateral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against
the midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a
dilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a fi xed pupil localizes a lesion poorly
but is ‘ipsilateralizing’). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis
(pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending re-
ticular activating system (ARAS) in the midbrain.
Cerebellar tonsil herniation is caused by pressure in the posterior fossa forcing
the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and
upgoing plantar refl exes occur fi rst, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing,
and apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and
poor compliance in, the posterior fossa.
Subfalcian (cingulate) herniation is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus
(medial frontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the
anterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke—eg contralateral leg
weakness ± abulia (lack of decision-making).

 Immediate management plan for raised intracranial pressure 831
ABC
Correct hypotension, maintain MAP >90mmHg and treat seizures
Brief examination; history if available:
Any clues, eg meningococcal rash, previous carcinoma
Elevate the head of the bed to 30–40°
If intubated, hyperventilate to PaCO2 (aim 3.5–4kPa):
This causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP almost
immediately. Maintain PaO2 >12kPa
Osmotic agents (eg mannitol) can be useful but
may lead to rebound ICP after prolonged use (~12–24h):
Give 20% solution 0.25–0.5g/kg IV over 10–20min (eg 5mL/kg).
Eff ect is seen after ~20min and lasts for 2–6h. Follow serum
osmolality—aim for about 300mosmol/kg but don’t exceed 310
Corticosteroids are not effective in reducing ICP
except for oedema surrounding tumours:
Eg dexamethasone 10mg IV and follow with 4mg/6h IV/PO
Consider other measures,
eg sedation, anti-epileptics, therapeutic hypothermia
Restrict fl uid to <1 . 5L/d
Monitor the patient closely; consider monitoring ICP
Aim to make a diagnosis
Treat cause or exacerbating factors,
eg hyperglycaemia, hyponatraemia
Defi nitive treatment if possible

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
Mechanism Normally the body metabolizes carbohydrates, leading to effi cient en-
ergy production. Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway used in starva-
tion states; it is far less effi cient, and produces acetone as a byproduct (hence the
fruity breath of patients in ketosis). In acute diabetic ketoacidosis, there is excessive
glucose, but because of a lack of insulin, this cannot be taken up into cells to be
metabolized, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where ketoacidosis
is the only mechanism of energy production. The combination of severe acidosis
and hyperglycaemia can be deadly, so early recognition and treatment is important.
Typical picture Gradual drowsiness, vomiting, and dehydration in type 1 diabetic
(very rarely type 2). Do glucose in all those with unexplained vomiting, abdo pain,
polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, anorexia, ketotic breath, dehydration, coma, or deep
breathing (sighing ‘Kussmaul’ hyperventilation). Triggers: Infection, eg UTI; surgery;
MI; pancreatitis; chemotherapy; antipsychotics; wrong insulin dose/non-compliance.
Diagnosis
1 Acidaemia (venous blood pH< 7.3 or HCO3Ω < 15.0mmol/L).
2 Hyperglycaemia (blood glucose> 11.0mmol/L) or known DM.
3 Ketonaemia (≥3.0mmol/L) or signifi cant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick).
Tests: ECG, CXR. Urine: Dipstick and MSU. Blood: Capillary and lab glucose, ketones, pH
(use venous blood; ABG only if GCS or hypoxia), U&E, HCO3Ω, osmolality, FBC, blood culture.
Severe DKA If one or more of the following features is present on admission, con-
sider transfer to HDU/ICU for monitoring and central venous access. Get senior help!
• Blood ketones >6mmol/L. • O2 sats <92% on air (assuming no res-
• Venous bicarbonate <5mmol/L. piratory disease).
• Venous/arterial pH <7.0. • Systolic BP <90mmHg.
• K <3.5mmol/L on admission. • Pulse >100 or <60 bpm.
• GCS <12. • Anion gap above 16 (p670).
Management Replace volume then correct metabolic defects,16 see fi g 19.23.
Pitfalls in diabetic ketoacidosis
• Plasma glucose is usually high, but not always, especially if insulin continued.
• High WCC may be seen in the absence of infection.
• Infection. Often there is no fever. Do MSU, blood cultures, and CXR. Start broad-
spectrum antibiotics (eg co-amoxiclav, p386) early if infection is suspected.
• Creatinine. Some assays for creatinine cross-react with ketone bodies, so plasma
creatinine may not refl ect true renal function.
• Hyponatraemia is common, due to osmolar compensation for the hyperglycaemia.
 or  [Na+] indicates severe water loss. As treatment commences Na+ rises as
water enters cells. Na+ is also low due to an artefact; corrected plasma [Na+] = Na+
+ 2.4[(glucose Ω5.5)/5.5].
• Ketonuria does not equate with ketoacidosis. Anyone may have up to ++ketonuria
after an overnight fast. Not all ketones are due to diabetes—consider alcohol if
glucose normal. Always check venous blood ketones.
• Recurrent ketoacidosis. Blood glucose may return to normal long before ketones
are removed from the blood, and premature termination of insulin infusion may
lead to lack of clearance and return to DKA. This may be avoided by maintaining
a constant rate of insulin infusion (with co-infusion of glucose 10% to maintain
plasma glucose at 6–10mmol/L) until blood ketones <0 . 6mmol/L and pH >7.3.
• Acidosis but without gross elevation of glucose may occur, but consider overdose
(eg aspirin) and lactic acidosis (in elderly diabetics).
• Serum amylase is often raised (up to ≈10) and non-specifi c abdominal pain is com-
mon, even in the absence of pancreatitis.
Complications Cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline), aspiration pneu-
monia, hypokalaemia, hypom agnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, thromboembolism.
Prevention Talk to the patient: evaluate compliance and educate about triggers.

 Management plan for diabetic ketoacidosis 833
ABC approach, 2 large-bore cannulae:
Start fl uid: 1L 0.9% saline over 1h (if systolic BP <90mmHg then give 500mL
bolus over 15mins and reassess—if systolic BP still <90mmHg then seek senior
review and give further 500mL bolus; if BP remains <90mmHg then involve ICU)
Tests: Venous blood gas for pH, bicarbonate; bedside and lab
glucose and ketones; U&ES, FBC, CRP; CXR, ECG
Insulin: Add 50 units human soluble insulin to 50mL 0.9% saline. Infuse con-
tinuously at 0.1 unit/kg/h. Continue patient’s regular long-acting insulin at usual
doses and times; consider initiating long-acting insulin in newly diagnosed T1DM.
Aim for a fall in blood ketones of 0.5mmol/L/h, or a rise in venous bicarbo-
nate of 3mmol/L/h with a fall in glucose of 3mmol/L/h. If not achieving this,
increase insulin infusion by 1 unit/h until target rates achieved
Check capillary blood glucose and ketones hourly
Check VBG (pH, HCO3Ω, K+) at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h (or more frequent)
Continue fl uids and assess need for K+ (see below)
Consider catheter if not passed urine by 1h, aim for urine output
0.5mL/kg/h. Consider NG tube if vomiting or drowsy
Start all patients on LMWH
Avoid hypoglycaemia! When glucose <14mmol/L start 10% glucose
at 125mL/h to run alongside saline and prevent hypoglycaemia
Continue fi xed-rate insulin until ketones <0 . 6mmol/L, venous pH
>7.3, and venous bicarb >15mmol/L. Do not rely on urinary ketones to
indicate resolution—they stay positive after DKA resolved
Find and treat infection/cause for DKA
Fig 19.23 Management plan for diabetic ketoacidosis.
 Fluid replacement
• 0.9% saline is the replacement fl uid of choice.
• Typical fl uid defi cit is 100mL/kg, so for an average 70kg man = 7 litres.
• Give eg 1L in 1h (faster if systolic BP <90mmHg) then: 1L over 2h, 1L over 2h, 1L
over 4h, 1L over 4 h, 1L over 8h. This regimen may not be appropriate for all: reas-
sess frequently, especially if young, elderly, pregnant, or comorbidities.
• Bicarbonate may increase risk of cerebral oedema and is not recommended.
 Potassium replacement
• Typical defi cit = 3–5mmol/kg, plasma K+ falls with treatment as K+ enters cells.
• Don’t add K+ to the 1st bag. Thereafter add K+ according to most recent VBG
result (table 19.5).

Other diabetic emergencies
Hypoglycaemia Usually rapid onset; may be accompanied by odd behaviour (eg ag-
gression), sweating, pulse, seizures. Management: If conscious, orientated, and able
to swallow, give 15–20g of quick-acting carbohydrate snack (eg 200mL orange juice)
and recheck blood glucose after 10–15mins (repeat snack up to 3 times). If conscious but
uncooperative, squirt glucose gel between teeth and gums. In unconscious patients, or
those not responding to these measures, start glucose IVI (eg 10% at 200mL/h if con-
scious; 10% at 200mL/15mins if unconscious), or give glucagon 1mg IV/IM (will not work
in malnourished patients). Expect prompt recovery. Once blood glucose >4.0mmol/L
and patient has recovered, give long-acting carbohydrate (eg slice of toast).
Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) Seen in unwell patients with type 2 DM.17
The history is longer (eg 1wk), with marked dehydration and glucose >30mmol/L. There is
no switch to ketone metabolism, so ketonaemia stays <3mmol/L and pH >7.3. Osmolality
is typically >320mosmol/kg: Occlusive events are a danger (focal CNS signs, chorea, DIC,
leg ischaemia/rhabdomyolysis)—give LMWH prophylaxis to all unless contraindication
(p350). Rehydrate slowly with 0.9% saline IVI over 48h, typical defi cits are 110–220mL/
kg, ie 8–15L for a 70kg adult. Replace K+ when urine starts to fl ow (see DKA BOX, p833).
Only use insulin if blood glucose not falling by 5mmol/L/h with rehydration or if keto-
naemia—start slowly 0.05u/kg/h. Keep blood glucose at least 10–15mmol/L for fi rst 24
hours to avoid cerebral oedema. Look for the cause, eg MI, drugs, sepsis, or bowel infarct.
Lactic acidosis A rare but serious complication of DM with metformin use or septi-
caemia. Blood lactate: >5mmol/L. Seek expert help. Treat sepsis vigorously, maintain
blood pressure and hence tissue perfusion. Stop metformin.
Thyroid emergencies
Myxoedema coma The ultimate hypothyroid state before death.
Signs and symptoms: Looks hypothyroid (p220, p221, fi g 5.16); often >65yrs; hypother-
mia; hyporefl exia; glucose; bradycardia; coma; seizures. May have had radioiodine,
thyroidectomy, or pituitary surgery (signs of hypopituitarism, p232). Psychosis (myxo-
edema madness) may precede coma. Precipitants: infection, MI, stroke, or trauma.
Examination: Goitre; cyanosis; BP (cardiogenic); heart failure; signs of precipitants.
Treatment: Preferably on ICU.
• Blood for: T3, T4, TSH, FBC, U&E (often Na+), cultures, cortisol, glucose.
• ABG for PaO2. High-fl ow O2 if cyanosed. Ventilation may be needed.
• Correct any hypoglycaemia.
• Give T3 (liothyronine) 5–20mcg/12h IV slowly. Be cautious: you may precipitate man-
ifestations of ischaemic heart disease. Alternative regimens involve levothyroxine.
• Give hydrocortisone 100mg/8h IV—vital if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected (ie
no goitre, no previous radioiodine, and no previous thyroid surgery).
• If infection suspected, give antibiotic, eg co-amoxiclav 1.2g/8h IV.
• Caution with fl uid, rehydrate as needed but watch for cardiac dysfunction; BP may
not respond to fl uid and inotropes may be needed.
• Active warming (blankets, fl uids) may be needed for hypothermia. Beware compli-
cations (hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, arrhythmias). See p848.
Further : T3 5–20mcg/4–12h IV until sustained improvement (~2–3d) then levothyrox-
ine 50mcg/24h PO. Hydrocortisone + IV fl uids as needed (hyponatraemia is dilutional).
Hyperthyroid crisis (thyrotoxic storm) Signs and symptoms: :≈4:1. Severe
hyper thyroidi sm (see p218): T°, agitation, confusion, coma, tachycardia, AF, D&V, goi-
tre, thyroid bruit, acute abdomen (exclude surgical causes), heart failure.
Precipitants: Recent thyroid surgery or radioiodine; infection; MI; trauma.
Diagnosis: Do not wait for test results if urgent treatment is needed. Do TSH, free T4,
and free T3. Confi rm with technetium uptake if possible.
Treatment: See fi g 19.24. Seek endocrinology advice and aim to: 1 Counteract periph-
eral eff ects of thyroid hormones. 2 Inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. 3 Treat systemic
complications. If you are not making headway in 24h, thyroidectomy may be an option.

 Management plan for thyrotoxic storm 835
IV access, fl uids if dehydrated. NG tube if vomiting
Take blood for: T3, T4, TSH, cultures (if infection suspected)
Sedate if necessary (eg chlorpromazine 50mg PO/IM). Monitor BP
If no contraindication, and cardiac output OK, give propranolol 60mg/4–
6h PO; max IV dose: 1mg over 10min; may need repeating every few hours.
In asthma/poor cardiac output, propranolol has caused cardiac arrest in
thyr oid storm, so ultra-short-acting -blockers have a role, eg IV esmolol.
Consider diltiazem if -blockers contraindicated. Get help
High-dose digoxin may be needed to slow the heart, but
ensure adequately -blocked, give with cardiac monitoring
Antithyroid drugs: carbimazole 15–25mg/6h PO (or via
NGT); after 4h give Lugol’s solution (aqueous iodine oral
solution) 0.3mL/8h PO well diluted in water for 7–10d to
block thyroid
Hydrocortisone 100mg/6h IV or dexamethasone 2mg/6h PO
to prevent peripheral conversion T4 to T3
Treat suspected infection, eg with co-amoxiclav 1.2g/8h IV
Adjust IV fl uids as necessary; cool with tepid
sponging ± paracetamol
Continuing treatment: After 5d reduce carbimazole to 15mg/8h PO.
After 10d stop propranolol and iodine. Adjust carbimazole (p218)

Addisonian crisis
Signs and symptoms Patients may present in shock (HR; vasoconstriction; pos-
tural hypotension; oliguria; weak; confused; comatose)—often (but not always) in a
patient with known Addison’s (eg when oral steroid has not been increased to cover
stress such as pneumonia), or someone on long-term steroids who has forgotten
their tablets. Remember bilateral adrenal haemorrhage (eg meningococcaemia) as
a cause. An alternative presentation is with hypoglycaemia.
Precipitating factors Infection, trauma, surgery, missed medication.
Management If suspected, treat before biochemical results.
• Bloods for cortisol and ACTH (this needs to go straight to laboratory, call ahead!),
U&ES—can have K+ (check ECG and give calcium gluconate if needed, see p301) and
Na+ (salt depletion, should resolve with rehydration and steroids).
• Hydrocortisone 100mg IV stat.
• IV fl uid bolus eg 500mL 0.9% saline to support BP, repeated as necessary.
• Monitor blood glucose: the danger is hypoglycaemia.
• Blood, urine, sputum for culture, then antibiotics if concern about infection.
Continuing treatment
• Glucose IV may be needed if hypoglycaemic.
• Give IV fl uids as guided by clinical state and to correct U&E imbalance.
• Continue hydrocortisone, eg 100mg/8h IV or IM.
• Change to oral steroids after 72h if patient’s condition good.
• Fludrocortisone may well be needed if the cause is adrenal disease: ask an expert.
• Search for (and vigorously treat) the underlying cause. Get endocrinological help.
Hypopituitary coma
Think of decompensated chronic hypophyseal failure whenever hypothermia, refrac-
tory hypotension ± septic signs without fever occur with short stat ure or loss of
axillary/pubic hair ± gonadal atrophy. Waiting for lab confi rmation may be fatal. It
usually develops gradually in a person with known hypopituitarism. If rapid onset
due to pituitary infarction (eg postpartum, Sheehan’s, p232), subarachnoid haemor-
rhage is often misdiagnosed as symptoms include headache and meningism.
Presentation Headache; ophthalmoplegia; consciousness; hypotension; hypo-
thermia; hypoglycaemia; signs of hypopituitarism (p232).
Tests Cortisol; T4; TSH; ACTH; glucose. Pituitary fossa CT/MRI.
Treatment Hydrocortisone, eg 100mg IV/6h.
• Only after hydrocortisone begun: liothyronine (L-tri-iodothyronine sodium), eg
10mcg/12h PO or by slow IV: 5–20mcg/12h (4-hourly may be needed).
• Prompt surgery is needed if the cause is pituitary apoplexy (p234).

Phaeochromocytoma emergencies 837
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may have had undiagnosed symptoms for some
time, but stress, abdominal palpation, parturition, general anaesthetic, or contrast
media used in imaging can cause acute hypertensive crises.
Signs and symptoms Pallor, pulsating headache, hypertension, feels ‘about to die’,
pyrexial. ECG: signs of LVF, ST segment, VT, and cardiogenic shock.
Treatment Get help. Take to ICU.
Principle is combined - and -adrenoreceptor blockade, but  must be started fi rst,
as unopposed -blockade can worsen hypertension.
• Start with short-acting, IV -blocker, eg phentolamine 2–5mg IV. Repeat to main-
tain safe BP.
• When BP controlled, give long-acting -blocker, eg phenoxybenzamine 10mg/24h
PO (increase by 10mg/d as needed, up to 30mg/12h PO); SE: postural hypotension;
dizziness; tachycardia; nasal congestion; miosis; idiosyncratic marked BP drop after
1st dose. The idea is to  the dose until BP is controlled and there is no signifi cant
postural hypotension. Alternative 1-selective blockers, eg doxazosin, are preferred
in some centres, particularly if surgery is not an option, eg metastatic tumour.
• A 1-blocker may also be given at this stage to control any tachycardia or myocar-
dial ischaemia/dysrhythmias (p114).
• Surgery is usually done electively after 4–6wks to allow full -blockade and volume
expansion. When admitted for surgery the phenoxybenzamine dose is increased
until signifi cant postural hypotension occurs.

Acute poisoning—general measures
Diagnosis Mainly from the history. The patient may not tell the truth about what
has been taken. If there are any tablets with the patient, use MIMS Colour Index,
EMIMS images, BNF descriptions, or the computerized system ‘TICTAC’ (ask pharmacy)
to identify tablets and plan specifi c treatment.
TOXBASE The best resource for managing acute poisoning: www.toxbase.org—check
with your Emergency Department about log-in details for your hospital.
Clues May become apparent from examination:
• Fast or irregular pulse: Salbutamol, antimuscarinics, tricyclics, quinine, or phe-
nothiazine poisoning.
• Respiratory depression: Opiate (p842) or benzodiazepine (p842) toxicity.
• Hypothermia: Phenothiazines (p843), barbiturates.
• Hyperthermia: Amphetamines, MAOIS, cocaine, or ecstasy (p843).
• Coma: Benzodiazepines, alcohol, opiates, tricyclics, or barbiturates.
• Seizures: Recreational drugs, hypoglycaemic agents, tricyclics, phenothia zines, or
theophyllines.
• Constricted pupils: Opiates (p842) or insecticides (organophosphates, p843).
• Dilated pupils: Amphetamines, cocaine, quinine, or tricyclics.
• Hyperglycaemia: Organophosphates, theophyllines, or MAOIS.
• Hypoglycaemia: (p834) Insulin, oral hypoglycaemics, alcohol, or salicylates.
• Renal impairment: Salicylate (p844), paracetamol (p844), or ethylene glycol.
• Metabolic acidosis: Alcohol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paracetamol, or carbon
monoxide poisoning (p842).
• Osmolality: Alcohols (ethyl or methyl); ethylene glycol. See p668.
Management See fi g 19.25.
• Take blood as appropriate (p840). Always check paracetamol and salicylate levels.
• Empty stomach if appropriate (p840).
• Consider specifi c antidote (p842) or oral activated charcoal (p840).
• If you are not familiar with the poison get more information. Toxbase (www.
toxbase.org) should be your fi rst thought. If no information here or in doubt how
best to act, phone the Poisons Information Service: in the UK phone 0844 892 0111.
Continuing care Measure temperature, pulse, BP, and blood glucose regularly. Keep
on cardiac monitor. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone, turn regularly. Catherize if the
bladder is distended, or acute kidney injury (p298) is suspected, or forced diuresis
undertaken. Consider ICU, eg if respiration.
Psychiatric assessment Be sympathetic despite the hour! Interview relatives and
friends if possible. Aim to establish:
• Intentions at time. Was this a suicide attempt, if so was the act planned? What
precautions against being found? Did the patient seek help afterwards? Does the
patient think the method was dangerous? Was there a fi nal act (eg suicide note)?
• Present intentions. Do they still feel suicidal? Do they wish it had worked?
• What problems led to the act: do they still exist?
• Is there a psychiatric disorder (depression, alcoholism, personality disorder,
schizophrenia, dementia)?
• What are the patient’s resources (friends, family, work, personality)?
The assessment of suicide risk: The following  chance of future suicide: original in-
tention was to die; present intention is to die; presence of psychiatric disorder; poor
resources; previous suicide attempts; socially isolated; unemployed; male; >50yrs old.
See OHCS p358. There is risk of death in the fi rst year following initial presentation.
Referral to psychiatrist: This depends partly on local resources. Refer all with pres-
ence of psychiatric disorder or high suicide risk. Consider discussing all presenta-
tions with deliberate self-poisoning.
Mental Capacity Act or the Mental Health Act: (In England and Wales) may pro-
vide for the detention of the patient against his or her will: see OHCS p406.

Acute poisoning—specifi c points
Plasma toxicology For all unconscious patients, paracetamol and aspirin levels and
blood glucose are required. The necessity of other assays depends on the drug taken
and the index of suspicion. Be guided by the Poisons Information Service. More
common assays include: digoxin; methanol; lithium; iron; theophylline. Toxicological
screening of urine, especially for recreational drugs, may be of use in some cases
(although not always, see BOX).
GI decontamination Recommended for many drugs. The treatment of choice is now
activated charcoal rather than gastric lavage. If in doubt, consult Toxbase or Poisons
Information Service.
Activated charcoal Reduces the absorption of many drugs from the gut when
given as a single dose of 50g with water, eg salicylates, paracetamol. It is given
in repeated doses (50g/4h) to increase elimination of some drugs from the blood,
eg carbamazepine, dapsone, theophyllines, quinine, phenobarbital, and paraquat.
Lower doses are used in children. Do not use with petroleum products, corrosives,
alcohols, clofenotane, malathion, or metal salts (eg iron, lithium).
Gastric lavage Rarely used. Lavage after 30–60min may make matters worse. Do
not empty stomach if petroleum products or corrosives such as acids, alkalis, bleach,
descalers have been ingested (exception: paraquat), or if the patient is unconscious
or unable to protect their airway (unless intubated). Never induce vomiting.
Gastric emptying and lavage NB: we do not recommend gastric lavage is at-
tempted unless specifi cally suggested by Toxbase or Poisons Information Service.
If comatose, or no gag refl ex, ask for an anaesthetist to protect airway with cuff ed
endotracheal tube. If conscious, get verbal consent.
• Monitor O2 by pulse oximetry. See p162.
• Have suction apparatus to hand and working.
• Position the patient in left lateral position.
• Raise the foot of the bed by 20cm.
• Pass a lubricated tube (14mm external diameter) via the mouth, asking the patient
to swallow.
• Confi rm position in stomach (see p759).
• Siphon the gastric contents. Check pH with litmus paper.
• Perform gastric lavage using 300–600mL tepid water at a time. Massage the left
hypochondrium then siphon fl uid.
• Repeat until no tablets in siphoned fl uid.
• Leave activated charcoal (50g in 200mL water) in the stomach unless alcohol, iron,
Li+, or ethylene glycol ingested.
• When pulling out tube, occlude its end (prevents aspiration of fl uid remaining in
the tube).
Haemodialysis This may be needed for poisoning from ethylene glycol, lithium,
methanol, phenobarbital, salicylates, and sodium valproate.

Legal highs 841
Increasingly, ‘designer’ drugs, with chemical properties similar to illegal drugs
(but yet suffi ciently distinct to fall outside current legislation), are leading to acute
poisoning and complications requiring admission. These drugs pose a diffi cult
problem for the admitting physician, as the precise chemistry and mechanisms
of action of both the active compound as well as any impurities are often unclear.
Although many are legal, they can be as deadly as many well-known recreational
drugs, leading to death or life-threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis.
Be aware that these drugs are out there, and ask specifi cally about legal highs
when taking a history, as there are often no screening tools for these drugs.

Some specifi c poisons and their antidotes
Benzodiazepines Flumazenil (for respiratory arrest) 200mcg over 15s; then 100mcg
at 60s intervals if needed. Usual dose range: 300–600mcg IV over 3–6min (up to 1mg;
2mg if on ICU). May provoke fi ts. Use only after expert advice.
-blockers Severe bradycardia or hypotension. Try atropine up to 3mg IV. Give
glucagon 2–10mg IV bolus + 5% glucose if atropine fails then infusion of 50mcg/
kg/h. Also consider including phosphodiesterase inhibitor infusions (eg enoximone
5–20mcg/kg/min). If unresponsive, consider pacing.
Cyanide This fast-killing poison has affi nity for Fe3+, and inhibits the cytochrome
system, aerobic respiration (therefore patients are acidotic with raised lactate).
Depending on degree of poisoning presentation can be:
• Mild: Dizziness, anxiety, tachycardia, nausea, drowsiness/confusion.
• Moderate: Vomiting, reduced consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis.
• Severe: Deep coma, fi xed unreactive pupils, cardiorespiratory failure, arrhythmias,
pulmonary oedema.
Treatment: 100% O2, GI deconta mination. If mild, supportive care is usually suf-
fi cient. If moderate/severe then specifi c treatment to bind cyanide is required. Give
sodium nitrite/sodium thiosulfate, or dicobalt edetate 300mg IV over 1min, then
50mL 50% glucose IV (repeat once if no response after a minute); or hydroxocobala-
min (Cyanokit∏) 5g over 15min repeated once if required. Get expert help. See p847.
Carbon monoxide Despite hypoxaemia skin is pink (or pale), not blue, as carboxyhae-
moglobin (COHb) displaces O2 from Hb binding sites. For the same reasons SpO2
from a pulse oximeter may be normal. Check ABG in a co-oximeter (ie ensure it meas-
ures haemoglobin, SaO2, Meth-Hb and COHb) which will show low SaO2 and high
COHb (normal <5%). Symptoms: Headache, vomiting, pulse, tachypnoea, and, if
COHb >50%, fi ts, coma, and cardiac arrest.
Treatment: Remove the source. Give 100% O2 until COHb <10%. Metabolic acido-
sis usually responds to correction of hypoxia. If severe, anticipate cerebral oedema
and give mannitol IVI (p831). Confi rm diagnosis with an ABG quickly as levels may
soon return to normal. Monitor ECG. If COHb >20%, patient has neurological or psy-
chological features, or cardiovascular impairment, fails to respond to treatment, or
is pregnant, consider hyperbaric O2: discuss with the poisons service.
Digoxin Symptoms: Cognition, yellow-green visual halos, arrhythmias, nausea, and
anorexia. If serious arrhythmias are present, correct hypokalaemia, and inactivate
with digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments (DigiFab®). If load or level is unknown, give
20 vials (800mg)—adult or child >20kg.
Heavy metals Enlist expert help.
Iron Desferrioxamine 15mg/kg/h IVI; max 80mg/kg/d. NB: gastric lavage if iron inges-
tion in last hour; consider whole-bowel irrigation.
Oral anticoagulants See p351. If major bleed, give vitamin K 5mg slow IV and
prothrombin complex concentrate 50U/kg IV (or if unavailable, fresh frozen plasma
15mL/kg IVI). For abnormal INR with no (or minimal) bleeding, see BNF. If it is vital
that anticoagulation continues, enlist expert help. Discuss with haematology. NB:
coagulation defects may be delayed for 2–3d following ingestion.
Opiates (Many analgesics contain opiates.) Give naloxone, eg 0.4–2mg IV; repeat
every 2min until breathing is adequate (it has a short t½, so it may need to be given
often or IM; max ~10mg). Naloxone may precipitate features of opiate withdrawal—
diarrhoea and cramps, which will normally respond to diphenoxylate and atropine
(eg co-phenotrope). Sedate as needed (see p15). High-dose opiate misusers may need
methadone (eg 10–30mg/24h PO) to combat withdrawal. Refer for help (OHCS p374).

Phenothiazine poisoning (Eg chlorpromazine.) No specifi c antidote. Dystonia
843
(torticollis, retrocollis, glossopharyngeal dystonia, opisthotonus): try procyclidine,
eg 5–10mg IM or IV. Treat shock by raising the legs (± plasma expander IVI, or ino-
tropes if desperate). Restore body temperature. Monitor ECG. Use lorazepam IV for
prolonged fi ts in the usual way (p826). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome consists
of: hyperthermia, rigidity, extrapyramidal signs, autonomic dysfunction (labile BP,
HR, sweating, urinary incontinence), mutism, confusion, coma, WCC, CK; it may be
treated with cooling. Dantrolene 1–2.5mg/kg IV (p572) (max 10mg/kg/day) can help,
bromocriptine and amantadine are alternatives.
Carbon tetrachloride poisoning This solvent, used in many industrial processes,
causes vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, seizures, coma, renal failure, and tender
hepatomegaly with jaundice and liver failure. IV acetylcysteine may improve prog-
nosis. Seek expert help.
Organophosphate insecticides Inactivate cholinesterase—the resulting increase
in acetylcholine causes the SLUD response: salivation, lacrimation, urination, and di-
arrhoea. Also look for sweating, small pupils, muscle fasciculation, coma, respiratory
distress, and bradycardia. Treatment: Wear gloves; remove soiled clothes. Wash
skin. Take blood (FBC and serum cholinesterase activity). Give atropine IV 2mg every
10min till full atropinization (skin dry, pulse >70, pupils dilated). Up to 3d treatment
may be needed. Also give pralidoxime 30mg/kg IVI over 20min, then 8mg/kg/h, max
12g in 24h. Even if fi ts are not occurring, diazepam 5–10mg IV slowly seems to help.
Paraquat poisoning (Found in weed-killers.) This causes D&V, painful oral ulcers,
alveolitis, and renal failure. Diagnose by urine test. Give activated charcoal at once
(100g followed by a laxative, then 50g/3–4h). Get expert help. Avoid O2 early on
(promotes lung damage).
Ecstasy poisoning Ecstasy is a semi-synthetic, hallucinogenic substance (MDMA,
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Its eff ects range from nausea, muscle pain,
blurred vision, amnesia, fever, confusion, and ataxia to tachyarrhythmias, hyper-
thermia, hyper/hypotension, water intoxication, DIC, K+, acute kidney injury (AKI),
hepatocellular and muscle necrosis, cardiovascular collapse, and ARDS. There is no
antidote and treatment is supportive. Management depends on clinical and lab fi nd-
ings, but may include:
• Administration of activated charcoal and monitoring of BP, ECG, and temperature
for at least 12h (rapid cooling may be needed).
• Monitor urine output and U&E (AKI pp298–9), LFT, CK, FBC, and coagulation (DIC p352).
Metabolic acidosis may benefi t from treatment with bicarbonate.
• Anxiety: lorazepam 1-2mg IV as a slow bolus into a large vein. Repeat doses may be
administered until agitation is controlled (see p826).
• Narrow complex tachycardias (p806) in adults: consider metoprolol 5mg IV.
• Hypertension can be treated with nifedipine 5–10mg PO or phentolamine 2–5mg IV.
Treat hypotension conventionally (p790).
• Hyperthermia: attempt to cool, if rectal T° >39°C consider dantrolene 1mg/kg IV
(may need repeating: discuss with your senior and a poisons unit). Hyperthermia
with ecstasy is akin to serotonin syndrome, and propranolol, muscle relaxation, and
ventilation may be needed.
Snakes (adders) Anaphylaxis: p794. Signs of envenoming: BP (vasodilation, vi-
per cardiotoxicity); D&V; swelling spreading proximally within 4h of bite; bleeding
gums or venepuncture sites; anaphylaxis; ptosis; trismus; rhabdomyolysis; pulmo-
nary oedema. Tests: WCC; abnormal clotting; platelets; U&E; urine RBC; CK; PaO2,
ECG. Management: Avoid active movement of aff ected limb (so use splints/slings).
Avoid incisions and tourniquets. Get help from local/national poisons service. Is
antivenom indicated (IgG from venom-immunized sheep)?—eg 10mL IV over 15min
(adults and children) of European Viper Antiserum (from Monviato) for adder bites
(see BNF);—20mL if severe envenoming have adrenaline to hand—p794. Monitor ECG.
For non-UK endemic snakes, see BNF.

Paracetamol poisoning
12g (=24 tablets) or 150mg/kg in adults may be fatal. If the patient weighs >110kg,
calculate ingested dose using a body weight of 110kg to avoid underestimating toxic-
ity. If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill.
Signs and symptoms None initially, or vomiting ± RUQ pain. Later: jaundice and
encephalopathy from liver damage (the main danger) ± acute kidney injury (AKI).
Management General measures: See p838. GI decontamination is recommended
in those presenting <4h after overdose: give activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g).
• Glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, HCO3Ω ; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion.
• If <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line
on the graph (see fi g 19.26), start acetylcysteine.
• If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and
start acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal.
• If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from inges-
tion, treatment may still help. Get advice.
Acetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/
kg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. Rash is a
common SE: treat with chlorphenamine + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid
reaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). An alternative (if acetyl-
cysteine unavailable) is methionine 2.5g/4h PO for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is
unreliable if vomiting.
Ongoing management
• Next day do INR, U&E, LFT. If INR rising, continue acetylcysteine until <1.4.
• If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don’t hesitate to get help.
• Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by eg King’s College criteria (BOX, p275).
Salicylate poisoning
Aspirin is a weak acid with poor water solubility. It is present in many over-the-
counter preparations. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic
metabolism and the production of lactate and heat. Eff ects are dose related and
potentially fatal: •150mg/kg: mild toxicity. •250mg/kg: moderate •>500mg/kg: severe
toxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal.
Signs and symptoms Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features:
• Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation, tinnitus, vertigo, sweating.
• Rarely GCS, seizures, BP and heart block, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia.
Patients present initially with respiratory alkalosis due to a direct stimulation of
the central respiratory centres and then develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyper- or
hypoglycaemia may occur.
Management General: (pp838–9.) Correct dehydration. Keep patient on ECG monitor.
Give activated charcoal to all presenting 1h—consider even if delayed presentation,
slow-release formations, or bezoar formation (can delay absorption): at least one dose
of 1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart).
1 Bloods. Paracetamol and salicylate level, glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, HCO3Ω, FBC.
Salicylate level may need to be repeated after 2h, due to continuing absorption
if a potentially toxic dose has been taken. Monitor blood glucose 1–2hrly, beware
hypoglycaemia, if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and U&E.
2 Urine. Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH.
3 Correct acidosis. If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe
metabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L 1.26% so-
dium bicarbonate IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5–8. NB: monitor serum K+ as
hypokalaemia may occur, and should be treated (caution if AKI).
4 Dialysis may well be needed if salicylate level >700mg/L, and if AKI or heart
failure, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, confusion or seizures, severe acidosis
despite best medical therapy, or persistently plasma salicylate. Contact neph-
rology early.
Discuss any serious cases with the local toxicological service or national poisons
information service.

Burns
Assessment Burn size is important to assess as it infl uences the size of the infl am-
matory response (vasodilation, increased vascular permeability) and thus fl uid shift
from the intravascular volume. Use Lund and Browder charts (see fi g 19.27) or the
‘rule of nines’ (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk
18%; perineum 1%). Ignore erythema. Burn depth determines healing time/scarring;
assessing this can be hard, even for the experienced. The big distinction is whether
the burn is partial thickness (painful, red, and blistered) or full thickness (insensate/
painless; grey-white). NB: burns can evolve, particularly over the fi rst 48h.
Resuscitation Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major
burns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and
depth of burn (fi g 19.27, to help calculate fl uid requirements). Referral is still war-
ranted in cases of full thickness burns >5%, partial thickness burns >10% in adults or
>5% in children or the elderly, burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns,
and burns with inhalational injury.
• Airway: Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if hot gases inhaled. Sus-
pect if history of fi re in enclosed space, soot in oral/nasal cavity, singed nasal hairs
or hoarse voice. A fl exible laryngo/bronchoscopy is useful. Involve anaesthetists
early and consider early intubation. Obstruction can develop in the fi rst 24h.
• Breathing: Exclude life-threatening chest injuries (eg tension pneumothorax) and
constricting burns—consider escharotomy if chest burns are impairing thorax ex-
cursion (OHCS p766). Give 100% O2. Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning (p842) from
history, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhaemoglobin level (COHb). With 100% O2 t½
of COHb falls from 250min to 40min (consider hyperbaric O2 if: pH<7.1; CNS signs;
>25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO2 (oxime try) is unreliable in CO poisoning.
• Circulation: Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require IV
fl uid resuscitation. Put up 2 large-bore (14G or 16G) IV lines. Do not worry if you have
to put these through burned skin; intraosseous access is valuable in infants and
can be used in adults (see OHCS p236). Secure them well: they are literally lifelines.
Use a burns calculator fl ow chart or a formula, eg: Parkland formula (popular): 4 ≈
weight (kg) ≈ % burn = mL Hartmann’s solution in 24h, half given in 1st 8h. Replace fl u-
id from the time of burn, not from the time fi rst seen in hospital. Formulae are only
guides: adjust IVI according to clinical response and urine output; aim for 0.5mL/kg/h
(1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury. Monitor
T° (core and surface); catheterize the bladder. Beware of over-resuscitation (‘fl uid
creep’) which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome.
Treatment ‘Cool the burn, warm the patient.’ Do not apply cold water to extensive
burns for long periods: this may intensify shock. Take care with circumferential full-
thickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particu-
larly after fl uid resuscitation. Decompress (escharotomy and fasciotomy) as needed.
If transferring to a burns unit, do not burst blisters or apply any special creams as
this can hinder assessment. Simple saline gauze or paraffi n gauze is suitable; cling
fi lm is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. Titrate morphine IV for good
analgesia. Ensure tetanus immunity. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used.
Defi nitive dressings There are many dressings for partial thickness burns, eg bio-
logical (pigskin, cadaveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadia zine cream alone or
with cerium nitrate as Flammacerium®; it forms a leathery eschar which resists
infection. Major full-thickness burns benefi t from early tangential excision and split-
skin grafts as the burn is a major source of infl ammatory cytokines and forms a rich
medium for bacterial growth.

Smoke inhalation 847
Consider if:
• History of exposure to fi re and smoke • Burns to face
in an enclosed space • Singed nasal hairs
• Hoarseness or change in voice • Soot in saliva or sputum
• Harsh cough • Infl amed oropharynx
• Stridor.
Initially laryngospasm leads to hypoxia and straining (leading to petechiae), then
hypoxic cord relaxation leads to true inhalation injury. Free radicals, cyanide com-
pounds, and carbon monoxide (CO) accompany thermal injury. Cyanide (p842)
compounds (generated, eg from burning plastics) stop oxidative phosphorylation,
causing dizziness, headaches, and seizures. Tachycardia + dyspnoea soon give way
to bradyc ardia + apnoea. CO is generated later in the fi re as oxygen is depleted. NB:
COHb levels do not correlate well with the severity of poisoning and partly refl ect
smoking status and urban life. Use nomograms to extrapolate peak levels.
100% O2 is given to elute both cyanide and CO.
Involve ICU/anaesthetists early if any signs of airway obstruction or respiratory
failure: early intubation and ventilation may be useful.
Enlist expert help in cyanide poisoning—see p842.

Hypothermia
Have a high index of suspicion and a low-reading thermometer. Most patients
are elderly and do not complain of, or feel, cold—so they have not tried to warm up.
In the young, hypothermia is usually from cold exposure (eg near-drowning), or is
secondary to impaired consciousness (eg following excess alcohol or drug overdose).
Defi nition Hypothermia implies a core (rectal) temperature <35°C.
Causes In the elderly, hypothermia is often caused by a combination of factors:
• Impaired homeostatic mechanisms: usually age-related.
• Low room temperature: poverty, poor housing.
• Impaired thermoregulation: pneumonia, MI, heart failure.
• Reduced metabolism: immobility, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus.
• Autonomic neuropathy (p505); eg diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s.
• Excess heat loss: psoriasis and any other widespread dermatological diseases (ie TEN/
erythrodermic eczema).
• Cold awareness: dementia, confusion.
• Increased exposure to cold: falls, especially at night when cold.
• Drugs: major tranquillizers, antidepressants, diuretics, alcohol.
The patient
• If the patient is shivering then the hypothermia is mild, if they are not shivering
despite temp <35°C then the hypothermia is severe.
• Symptoms and signs include confusion, agitation, GCS, coma, bradycardia, hypo-
tension and arrhythmias (AF, VT, VF), especially if temp <30°C.
There are many stories of people ‘returning to life’ when warmed despite absence of vital
signs, see BOX. It is essential to rewarm (see ‘Treatment’ later in topic) and re-examine.
Diagnosis Check oral or axillary T°. If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5°C, use a
low-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35°C? Infra-red ear thermometers
can accurately refl ect core temperature.
Tests Urgent U&E, plasma glucose, and amylase. Thyroid function tests; FBC; blood
cultures. Consider blood gases. The ECG may show J-waves (fi g 19.28).
Treatment Use ABCDE approach (p779)—but don’t expose to cold.
• All patients should receive warm, humidifi ed O2; ventilate if comatose or respira-
tory insuffi ciency.
• Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of ½°C/h (check temperature,
BP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min) using blankets or active external warm-
ing (hot air duvets). If T° rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid
rewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. A falling BP can be a sign of
too rapid warming.
• Warm IVI.
• Cardiac monitor is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming
or on stimulation).
• Consider antibiotics for the prevention of pneumonia (p166). Give these routinely in
patients over 65yrs with T° <32°C.
• Consider urinary catheter (to monitor renal function).
NB: in sudden hypothermia from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovas-
cular instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. Options
include warmed fl uid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal)
and intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). In the event of car-
diac arrest, defi brillation is usually unsuccessful if T° <30°C (consider amiodarone,
bretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C (OHCS p786).
Complications Arrhythmias (if there is a cardiac arrest continue resuscitating until
T° >33°C, as cold brains are less damaged by hypoxia); pneumonia; pancreatitis; AKI;
DIC. Prognosis: Depends on age and degree of hypothermia. If age >70yrs and T°
<32°C then mortality >50%.
Before hospital discharge Anticipate problems. Will it happen again? What is
their network of support? Review medication (could you stop tranquillizers)? How is
progress to be monitored? Liaise with GP/social worker.

‘I did not die but nothing of life remained...’
Remember that death is a process not an event, and that in hypothermia, all
processes are suspended: metabolism may slow to as much as 10% of baseline,
drastically diminishing the oxygen requirements of all tissues. Perhaps this is
what Dante had in mind for the last round of the 9th circle of Hell, in which
those betraying their benefactors are encased in ice (canto XXXIV) ‘Com’io di-
venni allor gelato e fi oco...Io non mori e non rimasi vivo—How frozen I then be-
came: I did not die but nothing of life remained’.
Human records: 13 month old Canadian Erica Nordby came to life 2 hours af-
ter her heart stopped (core T°: 16°C). Anna Bågenholm, a Swedish trainee or-
thopaedic surgeon, became trapped under freezing water covered by a layer of
ice for 80 minutes following a skiing accident, suff ering a cardiac arrest (core
T°: 13.7°C). After resuscitation and 20 days in intensive care, she regained con-
sciousness, suff ering no permanent brain damage. She is now a radiologist. Do
not declare anybody dead until they are warm and dead.

Major disasters
Planning All hospitals have a detailed Major Incident Plan, but additionally the
tasks of key personnel can be distributed on individual Action Cards.
At the scene Call the police to notify them of the Major Incident and ask them to
take command. They will set up a central command centre to assess and manage the
incident, depending on casualty numbers they will inform multiple hospitals of the
need to prepare for the imminent arrival of casualties.
Safety: Paramount—your own and others. Be visible (luminous monogrammed jack-
et) and wear protective clothing where appropriate (safety helmet; waterproofs;
boots; respirator in chemical environment).
Triage: See OHCS p800. There are several commercial systems available to label pa-
tients so emergency personnel can see at a glance the scale of the incident. The key
is to divide patients by the urgency of care/transfer to hospital:
1 Emergency (labelR ED = will die in a few minutes if no treatment)
2 Urgent (labelY ELLOW =will die in ~2h if no treatment)
3 Non-urgent (labelG REEN = walking wounded/those who are stable and can wait)
4 Deceased (labelB LUE/WHITE).
Communications: Essential; each emergency service will dispatch a control vehicle
and will have a designated incident offi cer for liaison. Support medical staff from
hospital report to the medical incident offi cer (MIO)—he or she is usually the fi rst
doctor on the scene. Their job is to assess then communicate to the receiving hos-
pital the number + severity of casualties, to organize resupply of equipment and to
replace fatigued staff . The MIO must resist temptation to treat casualties as this
compromises their role.
Equipment: Must be portable and include: intubation and cricothyrotomy set; intra-
venous fl uids (colloid); bandages and dressings; chest drain (+fl utter valve); amputa-
tion kit (when used, ideally 2 doctors should concur); drugs—analgesic: morphine;
anaesthetic: ketamine 2mg/kg IV over >60s (0.5mg/kg is a powerful analgesic with-
out respiratory depression); limb splints (may be infl atable); defi brillator/monitor ±
pulse oximeter.
Evacuation: Remember that with immediate treatment on scene, the priority for
evacuation may be reduced (eg a tension pneumothorax—RED—once relieved can
wait for evacuation and becomes YELLOW), but those who may suff er by delay at
the scene must go fi rst. Send any severed limbs to the same hospital as the patient,
ideally chilled—but not frozen.
At the hospital A ‘major incident’ is declared. The fi rst receiving hospital will take
most of the casualties; the support hospital(s) will cope with overfl ow and may
provide mobile teams so that staff are not depleted from the fi rst hospital. A control
room is established and the medical coordinator ensures staff have been summoned
and informed of their roles, nominates a triage offi cer, and supervises the best use of
inpatient beds and ICU/theatre resources.

Blast injuries 851
These may be caused by domestic (eg gas explosion) or industrial (eg mining)
accidents, or by terrorist bombs. Death may occur without any obvious external
injury. Injury occurs in a number of ways:
1 Blast wave: A transient (milliseconds) wave of overpressure expands rapidly
producing cellular disruption, shearing forces along tissue planes (submuco sal/
subserosal haemorrhage) and re-expansion of compressed trapped gas—bowel
perforation, fatal air embolism.
2 Blast wind: This can totally disrupt a body or cause avulsive amputations. Bod-
ies can be thrown and sustain injuries on landing.
3 Missiles: Penetration or laceration from missiles are by far the commonest
injuries. Missiles arise from the bomb or are secondary, eg glass.
4 Flash burns: These are usually superfi cial and occur on exposed skin.
5 Crush injuries: Beware sudden death or acute kidney injury from rhabdomy-
olysis after release.
6 Contamination: There is increasing concern about the use of biological or radi-
oactive material in terrorist bombs. Even domestic or industrial blasts can scat-
ter chemicals widely and cause both superfi cial and penetrating contamination.
Consider the location and mechanism of the blast, and seek advice.
7 Psychological injury: Eg post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353).
Treatment: Approach the same as any major trauma (OHCS p778). Rest and
observe any suspected of exposure to signifi cant blast but without other injury.
Gun-shot injury: see OHCS p789. Major blast injuries, whatever the cause, should be
reported to the police for investigation.

892 Early warning score
Early warning scores are scoring systems based on physiological parameters. The
magnitude of the given score refl ects how far the parameter varies from normal.
The collated score from diff erent parameters is used in:
• the assesssment of acute illness
• the detection of a clinical deterioration
• the initiation of a timely and competent clinical response.
A standardized National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is recommended for use across
the NHS.1 The components of the NEWS are detailed in fi g A1. An appropriate clinical
response to the aggregate score from fi g A1 is outlined in fi g A2.

Cardiorespiratory arrest
 Ensure the safety of the patient and yourself.
 Confi rm diagnosis: a patient who is unresponsive and not breathing properly is in
cardiac arrest (a manual pulse check is inaccurate and not recommended).
Basic life support Shout for help. Ask someone to call the arrest team and bring the
defi brillator. Note the time. ABC:
 Airway: Head tilt (if no spine injury) and chin lift/jaw thrust.
 Breathing: Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If there
is any doubt whether breathing is normal, proceed to chest compressions.
 Chest compressions: Place the heel of one hand on the centre of the chest (lower
half of the stenum). Place your second hand on top and interlock fi ngers. Use
straight arms. Give compressions at a rate of 100–120/min. Aim to compress the
sternum 5–6cm. After 30 compressions give 2 rescue breaths. Do not interrupt
compressions >10s. Continue with a ratio of 30:2 until defi brillator is available.
Advanced life support See algorithm fi g A3.
• Continue chest compressions while adhesive defi brillation/monitoring pads are
put in place. Plan all actions before pausing chest compressions.
• Stop chest compression for <5s to assess rhythm. Determine whether the rhythm is
shockable (VF/pulseless VT) or non-shockable (asystole, pulseless electrical activity).
Shockable rhythm: VF/pulseless VT
 A single person performs uninterrupted chest compressions while everyone else
prepares for defi brillation: stand clear, move oxygen delivery device 1m away.
 Select the appropriate energy on the defi brillator (150J or manufacturer's guide-
lines). When defi brillator is charged and safety check complete, the rescuer per-
forming chest compressions stands clear and the shock is delivered.
 CPR is resumed immediately (30:2). Reassess pulse/rhythm only after 2 minutes of CPR.
 Repeat if shockable rhythm remains. Give drugs after 3 shocks (see Drugs, this topic).
Non-shockable rhythm: asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA)
 Continue CPR 30:2. Obtain IV access and secure airway. Once airway secure switch
to continuous compressions and ventilation. Give adrenaline 1mg IV.
 Check rhythm every 2 minutes.
 Consider reversible causes (4HS and 4TS: hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hyper/hypokalae-
mia/other metabolic derangement, hypothermia, thrombosis, tension pneumotho-
rax, tamponade, toxins).
Drugs
• Give adrenaline 1mg IV every 3–5 mins for both shockable (from 3rd shock) and non-
shockable rhythms. In practice this means at every other rhythm check or shock.1
• In shockable rhythms give amiodarone 300mg IV after 3 defi brillation attempts.
Consider a further 150mg IV after 5 shocks. Lidocaine is an alternative.
Discontinuing resuscitation Needs clinical judgement: what is the likelihood of
achieving a successful return of spontaneous circulation? If there is a shockable
rhythm or a reversible cause then attempts are usually continued. It is reasonable
to discontinue if asystole >20mins without a reversible cause. Ask for the opinion of
others in the resuscitation team.
Resuscitation decisions Consider, discuss, and record CPR decisions:
• at the request of a patient with capacity
• as part of end-of-life care (p12, p536)
• in deteriorating, severe illness.
Your patient should be involved in decisions about CPR (unless it would cause physi-
cal or psychological harm). Explain your clinical decision to them, including futility.
Do not make judgements about the quality of life of others based on your own
perception.
1 Meta-analysis fails to show that adrenaline increases survival to hospital discharge (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pubmed/24193240). RCT results are awaited (Paramedic 2: The Adrenaline Trial ISRCTN 73485024).
