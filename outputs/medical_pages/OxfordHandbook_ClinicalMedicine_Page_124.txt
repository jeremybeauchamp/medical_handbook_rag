# Echocardiography

This non-invasive technique uses the differing ability of various structures within the heart to reflect ultrasound waves. It not only demonstrates anatomy but also provides a continuous display of the functioning heart throughout its cycle.

## Types of scan

### M-mode (motion mode):
A single-dimension image.

### Two-dimensional (real time):
A 2D, fan-shaped image of a segment of the heart is produced on the screen (fig 3.17); the moving image may be 'frozen'. Several views are possible, including long axis, short axis, 4-chamber, and subcostal. 2D echocardiography is good for visualizing conditions such as: congenital heart disease, LV aneurysm, mural thrombus, LA myxoma, septal defects.

### 3D echocardiography:
Now possible with matrix array probes, and is termed 4D (3D + time) if the images are moving.

### Doppler and colour-flow echocardiography:
Different coloured jets illustrate flow and gradients across valves and septal defects (p156) (Doppler effect, p736).

### Tissue Doppler imaging:
This employs Doppler ultrasound to measure the velocity of myocardial segments over the cardiac cycle. It is particularly useful for assessing longitudinal motionâ€”and hence long-axis ventricular function, which is a sensitive marker of systolic and diastolic heart failure.

### Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE):
More sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the transducer is nearer to the heart. Indications: diagnosing aortic dissections; assessing prosthetic valves; finding cardiac source of emboli, and IE/SBE. Contraindicated in oesophageal disease and cervical spine instability.

### Stress echocardiography:
Used to evaluate ventricular function, ejection fraction, myocardial thickening, regional wall motion pre- and post-exercise, and to characterize valvular lesions. Dobutamine or dipyridamole may be used if the patient cannot exercise. Inexpensive and as sensitive/specific as a thallium scan (p741).

## Uses of echocardiography

### Quantification of global LV function:
Heart failure may be due to systolic or diastolic ventricular impairment (or both). Echo helps by measuring end-diastolic volume. If this is large, systolic dysfunction is the likely cause. If small, diastolic. Pure forms of diastolic dysfunction are rare. Differentiation is important because vasodilators are less useful in diastolic dysfunction as a high ventricular filling pressure is required.

Echo is also useful for detecting focal and global hypokinesia, LV aneurysm, mural thrombus, and LVH (echo is 5-10 times more sensitive than ECG in detecting this).

### Estimating right heart haemodynamics:
Doppler studies of pulmonary artery flow and tricuspid regurgitation allow evaluation of RV function and pressures.

### Valve disease:
The technique of choice for measuring pressure gradients and valve orifice areas in stenotic lesions. Detecting valvular regurgitation and estimating its significance is less accurate. Evaluating function of prosthetic valves is another role.

### Congenital heart disease:
Establishing the presence of lesions, and significance.

### Endocarditis:
Vegetations may not be seen if <2mm in size. TTE with colour Doppler is best for aortic regurgitation (AR). TOE is useful for visualizing mitral valve vegetations, leaflet perforation, or looking for an aortic root abscess.

### Pericardial effusion:
Best diagnosed by echo. Fluid may first accumulate between the posterior pericardium and the left ventricle, then anterior to both ventricles and anterior and lateral to the right atrium. There may be paradoxical septal motion.

### HCM:
(p152) Echo features include asymmetrical septal hypertrophy, small LV cavity, dilated left atrium, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve.
