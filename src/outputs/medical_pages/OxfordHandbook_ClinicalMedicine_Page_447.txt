Diagnosis: Microscopy of stool (cysts and trophozoites, fig 9.40), aspirate or biopsy sample. Enzyme immunoassay: antigen detection as adjunct to microscopy, antibody detection in extra-intestinal disease. PCR can distinguish E. histolytica from morphologically identical but non-invasive E. dispar. Treatment: Metronidazole/tinidazole for amoebic dysentery and invasive disease. Diloxanide furoate: luminal agent, 10d course to destroy gut cysts, given in asymptomatic gut carriers and symptomatic disease, in addition to other treatment. Abscess may require (image-guided) drainage.

## Cyclospora

Coccidean protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis. ~50 imported cases/yr in UK. Presentation: Flu-like prodrome, watery diarrhoea, weight loss, marked fatigue, low-grade fever in ~25%. Self-limiting after 7-9wks in immunocompetent. Diagnosis: Autofluorescent oocytes in stool (appear blue-green under UV fluorescence fig 9.41), PCR. Treatment: Co-trimoxazole.

## Nematodes (soil-transmitted helminths and Trichinella)

- Roundworm: Ascaris lumbricoides ~1 billion affected, Trichinella spiralis (contaminated meat source).
- Whipworm: Trichuris trichiura, 600-800 million affected.
- Hookworm: Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale ~700 million affected.
- Threadworm: eg Strongyloides stercoralis, 30-100 million affected.

One of most common infections worldwide, affects poor and deprived (fig 9.42). Parasites live in intestines, producing 1000s egg/day in faeces. Humans infected by eggs (ascariasis, trichinosis) or larvae (Ancylostoma) in contaminated food; or via direct penetration of the skin (hookworm, Strongyloides). Presentation: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, blood/protein loss, impaired growth/cognitive development. Pruritus/urticaria if migration involves skin (Strongyloides fig 9.42). Lung invasion (ascariasis, hookworm, Strongyloides) can lead to a Loeffler-like syndrome: cough, SOB, wheeze, haemoptysis, consolidation, eosinophilia. Other tissue invasion (trichinosis): myalgia, conjunctivitis, photophobia, meningitis, encephalitis, neuropathy. Diagnosis: Clinical, eggs in stool sample (fig 9.43). Eosinophilia. Strongyloides serology/PCR. Treatment: table 9.26.

Fig 9.42 Larva currens: a serpinginous maculo-papular rash pathognomonic of chronic strongyloidiasis. Oedema, an urticarial appearance, and speed of migration (>5cm/hr) distinguish this from cutaneous larva migrans which is caused by animal (dog/cat) hookworm.

## Taeniasis (tapeworm)

Includes Taenia solium (pork, 2-8m, 50 000 eggs/worm), Taenia saginata (beef, 4-12m, 100 000 eggs/worm), Taenia asiatica (Asian, 4-8m, millions of eggs). Presentation: No or mild GI symptoms, tapeworm segments (proglottids) through anus/in faeces. Diagnosis: Eggs/proglottids in faeces. Treatment: Praziquantel, niclosamide.
