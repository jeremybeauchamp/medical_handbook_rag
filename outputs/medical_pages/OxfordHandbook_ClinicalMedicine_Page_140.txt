126 Narrow complex tachycardia

## Definition
ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms. Narrow QRS complexes occur when the ventricles are depolarized via the normal conduction pathways (fig 3.26).

## Differential diagnosis
### Regular narrow complex tachycardias: 
See fig 3.27.

### Irregular narrow complex tachycardias:
- Normal variant: sinus arrhythmia (rate changes with inspiration/expiration); sinus rhythm with frequent ectopic beats.
- Atrial fibrillation (AF): p131, fig 3.35.
- Atrial flutter with variable block: eg P-P-P-QRS-P-P-QRS (3:1 block then 2:1 block). The atrial rhythm is regular but the ventricular rhythm (hence pulse) is irregular.
- Multifocal atrial tachycardia: like focal atrial tachycardia but there are multiple groups of atrial cells taking it in turns to initiate a cardiac cycle. P-wave morphology and P-P intervals vary. Usually associated with COPD.

## Principles of management 
See p807.

- If the patient is compromised, use DC cardioversion (p770).
- Identify and treat the underlying rhythm: eg treating sinus tachycardia secondary to dehydration with IV fluids; treating multifocal sinus tachycardia secondary to COPD by correcting hypoxia and hypercapnia; treating focal atrial tachycardia secondary to digoxin toxicity with digoxin-specific antibody fragments; treating AVRT secondary to WPW with flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone; for atrial fibrillation (AF) and flutter see p130.
- If AVNRT or AVRT are suspected, consider transiently blocking the AVN. This should break the circuit of an atrio-ventricular re-entry rhythm, allowing sinus rhythm to re-establish. If the underlying rhythm is actually atrial in origin (eg flutter or atrial tachycardia), AVN blockade will not treat the rhythm but the paused ventricular activity will unmask the atrial rhythm (fig 3.28), aiding diagnosis and management. AVN blockade can be achieved by:
  1. Vagal manoeuvres: carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre (eg blowing into a syringe).
  2. IV adenosine: see p806.
- In some cases, narrow complex tachyarrhythmias cause symptomatic episodes of sufficient severity and frequency to warrant more invasive treatment, eg ablation therapy for accessory pathways.

Fig 3.28 This patient was given adenosine for tachycardia thought to be due to AVRT or AVNRT. The adenosine has slowed the ventricular rate, revealing flutter waves (sawtooth appearance), disproving an AVRT/AVNRT diagnosis.

## Holiday heart syndrome

Binge drinking in a person without any clinical evidence of heart disease may result in acute cardiac rhythm and/or conduction disturbances, which is called holiday heart syndrome (note that recreational use of marijuana may have similar effects). The most common rhythm disorders are supraventricular tachyarrhythmia and AF (consider this diagnosis in patients without structural heart disease who present with new-onset AF).

The prognosis is excellent, especially in young patients without structural heart disease. As holiday heart syndrome resolves rapidly by abstinence from alcohol use, advise all patients against the excessive use of alcohol in future.
