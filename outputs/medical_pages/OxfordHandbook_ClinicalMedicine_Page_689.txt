The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with 12 leads labeled I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6. The ECG is printed on pink graph paper.

Each lead shows a series of waveforms representing the electrical activity of the heart. The waveforms display characteristics consistent with hyperkalaemia, as noted in the caption below the ECG.

Below the ECG, there is a caption that reads:

Fig 14.4 Hyperkalaemiaâ€”note the flattening of the P waves, prominent T waves, and widening of the QRS complex.

At the bottom right corner of the image, there is an orange box containing the text "Clinical chemistry" and the number "675" next to it.

The ECG shows several features typical of hyperkalaemia:
1. Flattened P waves, which are difficult to discern in many of the leads
2. Prominent, peaked T waves, particularly visible in leads II, III, and V4-V6
3. Widened QRS complexes, indicating slowed ventricular depolarization

These ECG changes are consistent with the effects of elevated potassium levels on cardiac conduction, which can lead to serious arrhythmias if left untreated.
