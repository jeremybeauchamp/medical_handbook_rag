| STI | Presentation | Diagnosis | Treatment | Other |
|-----|---------------|------------|------------|-------|
| Chlamydia trachomatis | Often asymptomatic: detected on screening.<br>♀: dyspareunia, dysuria, post-coital/ inter-menstrual bleeding, vaginal discharge.<br>♂: dysuria, urethral discharge. | Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on:<br>♀: vulvovaginal swab—can be done by patient. Endocervical swabs and urine samples less sensitive.<br>♂: first-pass urine.<br>Oral/anal swabs if oral/anal sex. | Azithromycin 1g PO (single dose)<br>or<br>100mg doxycycline BD for 7d.<br>Partner tracing, screening, treatment.<br>Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment complete. | Pharyngeal and rectal infection may be asymptomatic. Complications:<br>♀: pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, reactive arthritis, perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).<br>♂: epididymo-orchitis, reactive arthritis.<br>Eye disease see p438. |
| Neisseria gonorrhoeae | Urethral/vaginal discharge, dysuria.<br>Asymptomatic: 50% ♀, 10% ♂, most pharyngeal/rectal infection. | Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on:<br>♀: vaginal swab or endocervical swab.<br>Urine samples less sensitive.<br>♂: first-pass urine.<br>Culture (endocervical/urethral swab prior to antibiotics) for sensitivity. | Ceftriaxone 500mg IM + azithromycin 1g PO. Complicated disease: add doxycycline ± metronidazole.<br>Partner tracing, screening, treatment.<br>Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment complete. | Antibiotic resistance. Complications:<br>♀: pelvic inflammatory disease: salpingitis, infertility, ectopic pregnancy.<br>♂: epididymitis, prostatitis, increased HIV transmission, reactive arthritis; infective endocarditis, disseminated gonococcal infection. |
| Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) | Urethral discharge, dysuria, urethral discomfort. Only assess symptomatic patients/visible discharge for urethritis. | ↑Polymorphonuclear leucocytes on microscopy of urethral swab. Needs testing for chlamydia and gonorrhoea.<br>Exclude UTI. | As for Chlamydia trachomatis.<br>5d course of azithromycin if patient/ partner known to be positive for Mycoplasma genitalium. | NGU refers to a pattern of infection rather than a cause. The main causes are Chlamydia trachomatis (11-50%) and Mycoplasma genitalium (6-50%). |
| Trichomonas vaginalis | ♀: vaginal discharge (~70%), itch.<br>♂: asymptomatic (~70%), discharge. | NAAT, culture, microscopy (mobile trichomonads). | Metronidazole (2g single dose or 5-7d course). Partner tracing, screening, treatment. Avoid sexual intercourse until treatment complete. | Pregnancy: ↑risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight.<br>May enhance HIV transmission. |
| Bacterial vaginosis | Thin, white, fishy-smelling vaginal discharge. No itch or soreness.<br>Asymptomatic in ~50%. | Gram stain to examine vaginal flora (predominance/absence of lactobacilli), clue cells, vaginal pH >4.5. | Oral or PV metronidazole<br>or<br>PV clindamycin. | Elevated vaginal pH alters vaginal flora: ↑anaerobic bacteria. Not sexually transmitted but associated with STI. |
| Genital candidiasis | Genital itch, burning, cottage cheese-like discharge, dyspareunia. | Microscopy and culture for Candida (see p408). | -azoles: pessary, eg clotrimazole, cream if vulval symptoms, oral fluconazole if severe. | Very common. No evidence for treatment of sexual partners. ↑Risk: pregnant, antibiotic therapy, DM, immunosuppressed. |
