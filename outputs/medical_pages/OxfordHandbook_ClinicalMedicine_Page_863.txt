> 'I did not die but nothing of life remained...'

Remember that death is a process not an event, and that in hypothermia, all processes are suspended: metabolism may slow to as much as 10% of baseline, drastically diminishing the oxygen requirements of all tissues. Perhaps this is what Dante had in mind for the last round of the 9th circle of Hell, in which those betraying their benefactors are encased in ice (canto XXXIV) 'Com'io divenni allor gelato e fioco...Io non mori e non rimasi vivo—How frozen I then became: I did not die but nothing of life remained'.

Human records: 13 month old Canadian Erica Nordby came to life 2 hours after her heart stopped (core T°: 16°C). Anna Bågenholm, a Swedish trainee orthopaedic surgeon, became trapped under freezing water covered by a layer of ice for 80 minutes following a skiing accident, suffering a cardiac arrest (core T°: 13.7°C). After resuscitation and 20 days in intensive care, she regained consciousness, suffering no permanent brain damage. She is now a radiologist. Do not declare anybody dead until they are warm and dead.
