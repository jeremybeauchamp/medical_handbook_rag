# Management of acute asthma

## Assess severity of attack:
PEF, ability to speak, RR, pulse rate, O₂ sats
Warn ICU if severe or life-threatening attack

## Immediate treatment:
- Supplemental O₂ to maintain sats 94-98%
- Salbutamol 5mg (or terbutaline 10mg) nebulized with O₂
- If severe/life-threatening add in ipratropium 0.5mg/6h to nebulizers
- Hydrocortisone 100mg IV or prednisolone 40-50mg PO

## Reassess every 15min:
- If PEF <75% repeat salbutamol nebulizers every 15-30min, or 10mg/h continuously. Add ipratropium if not already given
- Monitor ECG; watch for arrhythmias
- Consider single dose of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) 1.2-2g IV over 20min in those with severe/life-threatening features without good initial response to therapy

### If not improving:
Refer to ICU for consideration of ventilatory support and intensification of medical therapy, eg aminophylline, IV salbutamol if any of the following signs are present:
- Deteriorating PEF
- Persistent/worsening hypoxia
- Hypercapnia
- ABG showing low pH or high H⁺
- Exhaustion, feeble respiration
- Drowsiness, confusion, altered conscious level
- Respiratory arrest

### If improving within 15-30min:
- Continue nebulized salbutamol every 4-6h (+ ipratropium if started in previous step)
- Prednisolone 40-50mg PO OD for 5-7 days
- Monitor peak flow and O₂ sats, aim 94-98% with supplemental if needed
- If PEF >75% 1h after initial treatment, consider discharge with outpatient follow-up
