## Signs of respiratory distress

- Tachypnoea.
- Nasal flaring.
- Tracheal tug (pulling of thyroid cartilage towards sternal notch in inspiration).
- Use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, platysma, infrahyoid).
- Intercostal, subcostal, and sternal recession.
- Pulsus paradoxus (p42).

## Breathing patterns

**Hyperventilation:** Tachypnoea (ie >20 breaths/min) or deep (hyperpnoea, ie tidal volume). Hyperpnoea is not unpleasant, unlike dyspnoea. It may cause respiratory alkalosis, hence paraesthesiae ± muscle spasm (↓Ca²⁺). The main cause is anxiety: associated dizziness, chest tightness/pain, palpitations, and panic. Rare causes: response to metabolic acidosis; brainstem lesions.

- **Kussmaul respiration** is deep, sighing breaths in severe metabolic acidosis (blowing off CO₂), eg diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal impairment.
- **Neurogenic hyperventilation** is produced by pontine lesions.
- **The hyperventilation syndrome** involves panic attacks associated with hyperventilation, palpitations, dizziness, faintness, tinnitus, alarming chest pain/tightness, perioral and peripheral tingling (plasma ↓Ca²⁺). Treatment: relaxation techniques and breathing into a paper bag (↑inspired CO₂ corrects the alkalosis). NB: the anxious patient in A&E with hyperventilation and a respiratory alkalosis may actually be presenting with an aspirin overdose (p844).

**Cheyne-Stokes breathing:** Breaths get deeper and deeper, then shallower (±episodic apnoea) in cycles. Causes—brainstem lesions or compression (stroke, ↑ICP). If the cycle is long (eg 3min), the cause may be a long lung-to-brain circulation time (eg in chronic pulmonary oedema or ↓cardiac output). It is enhanced by opioids.

## Sputum examination

**Further examination—sputum, temperature charts, O₂ sats, PEFR:** Inspect sputum and send suspicious sputum for microscopy (Gram stain and auramine/ZN stain, if indicated), culture, and cytology.

- Black carbon specks suggests smoking: commonest cause of increased sputum.
- Yellow/green sputum suggests infection, eg bronchiectasis, pneumonia.
- Pink frothy sputum suggests pulmonary oedema.
- Bloody sputum (haemoptysis) may be due to malignancy, TB, infection, or trauma, and requires investigation for these causes. See p49.
- Clear sputum is probably saliva.
