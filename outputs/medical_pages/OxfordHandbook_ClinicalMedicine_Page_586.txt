## Anaesthesia

Before anaesthesia, explain to the patient what will happen and where they will wake up, otherwise the recovery room or ITU will be frightening. Explain that they may feel ill on waking. The premedication aims to allay anxiety and to make the anaesthesia itself easier to conduct (see BOX). Typical regimens might include:

- **Anxiolytics:** Benzodiazepines, eg lorazepam 2mg PO; temazepam 10-20mg PO. In children, use oral premeds as first choice, eg midazolam 0.5mg/kg (tastes bitter so often put in paracetamol suspension). Give oral premedication 2h before surgery (1h if IM route used).
- **Analgesics:** See p574. Pre-emptive analgesia is not often used and effects are hard to determine. The aim is to dampen pain signals before they arrive. In children or anxious adults, local anaesthetic cream may be used on a few sites before inserting an IVI (►the anaesthetist may prefer to site the cannula themselves!).
- **Anti-emetics:** Post-operative nausea and vomiting is experienced by ~25% of all patients. 5HT3 antagonists (eg ondansetron 4mg IV/IM) are the most effective agents; others, eg metoclopramide 10mg/8h IV/IM/PO, are also used—see p251.
- **Antacids:** Ranitidine 50mg IV or omeprazole 40mg PO/IV if aspiration risk.
- **Antisialogues:** Glycopyrronium (200-400mcg in adults, 4-8mcg/kg in children; given IV/IM 30-60min before induction) is sometimes used to decrease secretions that may cause respiratory obstruction in smaller airways.
- **Antibiotics:** See p570.

### Side-effects of anaesthetic agents
- **Hyoscine, atropine:** Anticholinergic, ∴ tachycardia, urinary retention, glaucoma, sedation (especially in the elderly).
- **Opioids:** Respiratory depression, ↓cough reflex, nausea and vomiting, constipation.
- **Thiopental:** (Induction agent.) Laryngospasm.
- **Propofol:** (Induction agent.) Respiratory/cardiac depression, pain on injection.
- **Volatile agents, eg isoflurane:** Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respiratory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF).

### The complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of:
- **Pain sensation:** Urinary retention, pressure necrosis, local nerve injuries (eg radial nerve palsy from arm hanging over the table edge).
- **Consciousness:** Cannot communicate 'wrong leg/kidney'. NB: in some patients (eg 0.15%) retained consciousness is the problem. Awareness under GA sounds like a contradiction of terms, but remember that anaesthesia is a process rather than an event. Such awareness can lead to ill-defined, delayed neuroses and post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353).
- **Muscle power:** Corneal abrasion (∴ tape the eyes closed), no respiration, no cough (leads to pneumonia and atelectasis—partial lung collapse causing shunting ± impaired gas exchange: it starts minutes after induction, and may be related to the use of 100% O2, supine position, surgery, age, and to loss of power).

### Local/regional anaesthesia
If unfit/unwilling to undergo general anaesthesia, local nerve blocks (eg brachial plexus) or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagulation, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be indicated. See table 13.4 for doses and toxicity effects.

### Drugs complicating anaesthesia
►Inform anaesthetist. See p566 for lists of specific drugs, and actions to take.

### Malignant hyperpyrexia
This is a rare complication, precipitated by any volatile agent, eg halothane, or suxamethonium. It exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. There is a rapid rise in temperature (>1°C every 30min); masseter spasm may be an early sign. Complications include hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, and arrhythmias. ►Get expert help immediately. Prompt treatment with dantrolene³ (skeletal muscle relaxant), active cooling and ITU care can reduce mortality significantly.

³ Give 1mg/kg every 5min IV—up to 10mg/kg in total (OHCS p628).
