# Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics Classification

A favourite differential diagnosis, SLE mimics other illnesses, with wide variation in symptoms that may come and go unpredictably. Diagnose SLE<sup>47</sup> in an appropriate clinical setting if ≥4 criteria (at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory) or biopsy-proven lupus nephritis with positive ANA or anti-DNA.

## Clinical criteria

1. **Acute cutaneous lupus**: Malar rash/butterfly. Fixed erythema, flat or raised, over the malar eminences, tending to spare the nasolabial folds (fig 12.14). Occurs in up to 50%. Bullous lupus, toxic epidermal necrolysis variant of SLE, maculopapular lupus rash, photosensitive lupus rash, or subacute cutaneous lupus (non-indurated psoriasiform and/or annular polycyclic lesions that resolve without scarring).

2. **Chronic cutaneous lupus**: Discoid rash, erythematous raised patches with adherent keratotic scales and follicular plugging ± atrophic scarring (fig 12.15). Think of it as a three-stage rash affecting ears, cheeks, scalp, forehead, and chest: erythema→pigmented hyperkeratotic oedematous papules→atrophic depressed lesions.

3. **Non scarring alopecia**: (In the absence of other causes.)

4. **Oral/nasal ulcers**: (In the absence of other causes.)

5. **Synovitis**: (Involving two or more joints or two or more tender joints with >30 minutes of morning stiffness.)

6. **Serositis**: a) Lung (pleurisy for >1 day, or pleural effusions, or pleural rub; b) pericardial pain for >1 day, or pericardial effusion, or pericardial rub, or pericarditis on ECG.

7. **Urinanalysis**: Presence of proteinuria (>0.5g/d ) or red cell casts.

8. **Neurological features**: Seizures; psychosis; mononeuritis multiplex; myelitis; peripheral or cranial neuropathy; cerebritis/acute confusional state in absence of other causes.

9. **Haemolytic anaemia**.

10. **Leucopenia**: (WCC <4.) At least once, or lymphopenia (lymphocytes <1) at least once.

11. **Thrombocytopenia**: (Platelets <100.) At least once.

## Laboratory criteria

1. +ve ANA (+ve in >95%).
2. Anti-dsDNA.
3. Anti-Smith antibodies present.
4. Antiphospholipid Abs present.
5. Low complement (C3, C4, or C50).
6. +ve Direct Coombs test.
