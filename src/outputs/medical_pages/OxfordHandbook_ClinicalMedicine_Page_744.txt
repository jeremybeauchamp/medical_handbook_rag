# Computed tomography (CT)

Can give whole-body images in under one breath (thanks to continuous, helical data acquisition). Within a single slice (eg 0.5 or 5mm thick), CT records the attenuation (=loss of energy from, eg absorption or reflection) of different tissues to ionizing radiation and calculates a mean value for a given volume of tissue (a 'voxel'). This value is represented in greyscale as a single point, called a pixel, in the final 2D image (or 3D 'reconstruction'—fig 16.13). The greyscale of the pixel is measured on the Hounsfield scale (see fig 16.10) relative to the attenuation of water, 0 Hounsfield units (HU), and air, -1000HU. The human eye and display systems have a limited greyscale range, so different settings (levels and 'windows') are used to focus on differences in attenuation in ranges typical for tissues of different density, eg bone or lung (fig 16.11).

CTs are responsible for up to 40% of iatrogenic radiation in high-use settings, which could account for ~1% of all cancers: always balance benefits of CT vs other modalities with less or no radiation (ultrasound; MRI), particularly in the young or in those with chronic disease likely to undergo multiple imaging investigations. Discuss with a radiologist—there are several technical aspects of imaging that can limit radiation dose whilst still providing clinically useful information.

## Imaging of choice for
- Staging and monitoring most malignant disease.
- Intracranial pathology, eg stroke, trauma, ICP, and space-occupying lesions.
- Trauma.
- Pre-operative assessment of complex masses.
- Assessment of acute abdomen (figs 16.15, 16.16). NB ultrasound increasingly used (p736).
- Following abdominal surgery.

## Contrast medium (p748) 
Enhance anatomical detail by use of a high- or low (water)-attenuating medium to fill the lumen of a structure. Give IV to image vascular anatomy (fig 16.12) and vascular structures (including highly perfused tumours). Images acquired at different times ('phases') after injection will show the agent in arterial or venous structures or during 'washout' (=clearing). Perfusion CT maps cerebral blood flow by acquiring serial images after contrast administration then combines these into a colour-coded image of perfusion times (fig 16.14). Ensure IV cannulae secure and sufficient gauge to allow for rapid injection of agent as bolus—extravasation of contrast can cause significant tissue damage. Give PO eg 1-12h before imaging bowel. Give PR for examining distal colonic lumen.

Contrast-enhanced CTs may include a pre-contrast series. Unenhanced imaging alone reduces radiation exposure and may be adequate for images of the brain, spine, lung, and musculoskeletal system or necessary in those with renal failure (contrast is nephrotoxic).

## Streak artefact 
Remember that the CT slice image is a matrix representation of the attenuation produced by rotating around the patient. High-attenuation items such as metal fillings, clips, and prostheses (and even bone) can cause interference.

## CT combined with PET 
(See p739.) Combines the anatomical detail of CT with the metabolic information of PET, to aid assessment of, eg neoplastic lesions. Radiation doses are much higher than CT alone.
