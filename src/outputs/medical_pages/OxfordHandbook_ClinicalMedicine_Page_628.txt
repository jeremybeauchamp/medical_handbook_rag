# Inguinal hernias

Indirect hernias pass through the internal inguinal ring and, if large, out through the external ring (fig. 13.33). Direct hernias push their way directly forward through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, into a defect in the abdominal wall (Hesselbach's triangle; medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and lateral to the rectus abdominus). Predisposing conditions: males (♂:♀≈8:1), chronic cough, constipation, urinary obstruction, heavy lifting, ascites, past abdominal surgery (eg damage to the iliohypogastric nerve during appendicectomy). There are two landmarks to identify: the deep (internal) ring may be defined as being the mid-point of the inguinal ligament, ~1½ cm above the femoral pulse (which crosses the mid-inguinal point); the superficial (external) ring is a split in the external oblique aponeurosis just superior and medial to the pubic tubercle (the bony prominence forming the medial attachment of the inguinal ligament).

## Examination
Look for previous scars; feel the other side (more common on the right); examine the external genitalia. Then ask: 
- Is the lump visible? If so, ask the patient to reduce it—if he cannot, make sure that it is not a scrotal lump. Ask him to cough. Appears above and medial to the pubic tubercle. 
- If no lump is visible, feel for a cough impulse. 
- Repeat the examination with the patient standing. 

Distinguishing direct from indirect hernias: This is loved by examiners but is of little clinical use—not least because repair is the same for both (see 'Repairs' later in topic). The best way is to reduce the hernia and occlude the deep (internal) ring with two fingers. Ask the patient to cough or stand—if the hernia is restrained, it is indirect; if not, it is direct. The 'gold standard' for determining the type of inguinal hernia is at surgery: direct hernias arise medial to the inferior epigastric vessels; indirect hernias are lateral.

| Indirect hernias: | Direct hernias: | Femoral hernias: |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| • Common (80%) | • Less common (20%) | • More frequent in females |
| • Can strangulate. | • Reduce easily | • Frequently irreducible |
| | • Rarely strangulate. | • Frequently strangulate. |

## Irreducible hernias
You may be called because a long-standing hernia is now irreducible and painful. It is always worth trying to reduce these yourself to prevent strangulation and necrosis (demanding prompt laparotomy). Learn how to do this from an expert, ie one of your patients who has been reducing his hernia for years. Then you will know how to act correctly when the emergency presents. Notice that such patients use the flat of the hand, directing the hernia from below, up towards the contralateral shoulder. Sometimes, as the hernia obstructs, reduction requires perseverance, which may be rewarded by a gurgle from the retreating bowel and a kiss from the attending spouse who had thought that surgery was inevitable.

## Repairs
Weight loss (if over-weight) and stop smoking pre-op. Warn that hernias may recur and patients should be counselled about possibility of chronic pain post-operatively. Mesh techniques (eg Lichtenstein repair) have replaced older methods. In mesh repairs, a polypropylene mesh reinforces the posterior wall. Recurrence rate is less than with other methods (eg <2% vs 10%). (CI: strangulated hernias, contamination with pus/bowel contents.) Local anaesthetic techniques and day-case 'ambulatory' surgery may halve the price of surgery. This is important because this is one of the most common operations (>100,000 per year in the UK). Laparoscopic repair gives similar recurrence rates. Methods include transabdominal pre-peritoneal (TAPP) in which the peritoneum is entered and the hernia repaired, and totally extraperitoneal (TEP), which decreases the risk of visceral injury. For benefits of laparoscopic surgery see p592.

## Return to work
Will depend upon surgical approach and patient—discuss this pre-operatively. Rest for 4wks and convalescence over 8wks with open approaches, but laparoscopic repairs may allow return to manual work (and driving) after ≤2wks if all is well.
