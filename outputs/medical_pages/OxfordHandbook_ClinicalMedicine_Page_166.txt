## Diseases of heart muscle

### Acute myocarditis
This is inflammation of myocardium, often associated with pericardial inflammation (myopericarditis). Causes: See table 3.3. Symptoms and signs: ACS-like symptoms, heart failure symptoms, palpitations, tachycardia, soft S1, S4 gallop (p44). Tests: ECG: ST changes and T-wave inversion, atrial arrhythmias, transient AV block, QT prolongation. Bloods: CRP, ESR, & troponin may be raised; viral serology and tests for other likely causes. Echo: diastolic dysfunction, regional wall abnormalities. Cardiac MR if clinically stable. Endomyocardial biopsy is gold standard. Rx: Supportive. Treat the underlying cause. Treat arrhythmias and heart failure (p136). NSAID use is controversial. Avoid exercise as this can precipitate arrhythmias. Prognosis: 50% will recover within 4wks. 12-25% will develop DCM and severe heart failure. DCM can occur years after apparent recovery.

### Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
A dilated, flabby heart of unknown cause. Associations: alcohol, ↑BP, chemotherapeutics, haemochromatosis, viral infection, autoimmune, peri- or postpartum, thyrotoxicosis, congenital (X-linked). Prevalence: 0.2%. Presentation: Fatigue, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, RVF, emboli, AF, VT. Signs: ↑Pulse, ↓BP, ↑JVP, displaced and diffuse apex, S3 gallop, mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (MR/TR), pleural effusion, oedema, jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites. Tests: Blood: BNP (p137), ↓Na+ indicates a poor prognosis. CXR: cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. ECG: tachycardia, non-specific T-wave changes, poor R-wave progression. Echo: globally dilated hypokinetic heart and low ejection fraction. Look for MR, TR, LV mural thrombus. Rx: Bed rest, diuretics, β-blockers, ACE-i, anticoagulation, biventricular pacing, ICDs, LVADs, transplantation. Mortality: Variable, eg 40% in 2yrs.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction from asymmetric septal hypertrophy. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Prevalence: 0.2%. Autosomal dominant inheritance, but 50% are sporadic. 70% have mutations in genes encoding β-myosin, α-tropomyosin, and troponin T. May present at any age. Ask about family history of sudden death. Symptoms and signs: Sudden death may be the first manifestation of HCM in many patients (VF is amenable to implantable defibrillators), angina, dyspnoea, palpitation, syncope, CCF. Jerky pulse; a wave in JVP; double-apex beat; systolic thrill at lower left sternal edge; harsh ejection systolic murmur. Tests: • ECG: LVH; progressive T-wave inversion; deep Q waves (inferior + lateral leads); AF; WPW syndrome (p133); ventricular ectopics; VT. • Echo: asymmetrical septal hypertrophy; small LV cavity with hypercontractile posterior wall; midsystolic closure of aortic valve; systolic anterior movement of mitral valve. • MRI: see fig 3.16. • Cardiac catheterization helps assess: severity of gradient; coronary artery disease or mitral regurgitation, but may provoke VT. • Electrophysiological studies may be needed (eg if WPW, p133). • Exercise test ± Holter monitor (p125) to risk stratify. Rx: β-blockers or verapamil for symptoms (the aim is reducing ventricular contractility). Amiodarone (p130) for arrhythmias (AF, VT). Anticoagulate for paroxysmal AF or systemic emboli. Septal myomectomy (surgical or chemical (with alcohol) to ↓LV outflow tract gradient) is reserved for those with severe symptoms. Consider implantable defibrillator—use http://www.doc2do.com/hcm/webHCM.html to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Mortality: 5.9%/yr if <14yrs; 2.5%/yr if >14yrs. Poor prognostic factors: age <14yrs or syncope at presentation; family history of HCM/sudden death.

### Restrictive cardiomyopathy
Causes: Idiopathic; amyloidosis; haemochromatosis; sarcoidosis; scleroderma; Löffler's eosinophilic endocarditis; endomyocardial fibrosis. Presentation: Is like constrictive pericarditis (p154). Features of RVF predominate: ↑JVP, with prominent x and y descents; hepatomegaly; oedema; ascites. Diagnosis: Echo, MRI, cardiac catheterization. Rx: Treat the cause.

### Cardiac myxoma (figs 3.49, 3.50)
Rare benign cardiac tumour. Prevalence ≤5/10 000, ♀:♂≈2:1. Usually sporadic, but may be familial (Carney complex: cardiac and cutaneous myxomas, skin pigmentation, endocrinopathy, etc., p223). It may mimic infective endocarditis (fever, weight loss, clubbing, ↑ESR, systemic emboli), or mitral stenosis (left atrial obstruction, AF). A 'tumour plop' may be heard, and signs may vary according to posture. Tests: Echo. Rx: Excision.
