# Warfarin guidelines and target levels for INR

- Pulmonary embolism and DVT. Aim for INR of 2-3; 3.5 if recurrent PE or DVT whilst anticoagulated.
- Atrial fibrillation: for stroke prevention (p130). Target INR 2-3.
- Prosthetic metallic heart valves: for stroke prevention. Target INR 2-3 if aortic valve or 2.5-3.5 if mitral valve.

Duration of anticoagulation in DVT/PE: First episodes of DVT or PE require at least 3 months of anticoagulation. Consider extending this to 6 months in patients with more extensive, life-threatening clot at presentation, for those with transient but persistent risk factors (eg prolonged immobility) or if evidence of persistent clot at 3 months. For those with recurrent unprovoked emboli or underlying thrombophilia (p374), consider bleeding risks against benefits of indefinite treatment.

## Warfarin dosage and what to do when the INR is much too high

Below is a rough guide to warfarin dosing for target INR of 2-3.

### Table 8.5 Suggested dosing for day 3 of warfarin loading

| INR          | <2   | 2    | 2.5  | 2.9  | 3.3  | 3.6   | 4.1 |
|--------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-----|
| 3rd dose     | 5mg  | 5mg  | 4mg  | 3mg  | 2mg  | 0.5mg | 0mg |
| Maintenance  | ≥6mg | 5.5mg| 4.5mg| 4mg  | 3.5mg| 3mg   | *   |

*Miss a dose; give 1-2mg the next day; if INR >4.5, miss 2 doses.

### Table 8.6 When the INR is much too high (see also BNF)

| Condition                                 | Action                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INR 5-8, no bleed                         | Withold 1-2 doses. Restart warfarin at a lower maintenance dose once INR <5.                                                                                              |
| INR 5-8, minor bleed*                     | Stop warfarin and admit for urgent IV vitamin K (give slowly). Restart warfarin when INR <5.                                                                              |
| INR >8, no bleed                          | Stop warfarin and seek haematology advice.                                                                                                                                |
| INR >8, minor bleed*                      | Stop warfarin and admit for urgent IV vitamin K. Check INR daily—repeat vitamin K if INR too high after 24h. Restart warfarin at a lower dose when INR <5.               |
| Any major bleed (including intracranial haemorrhage) | Stop warfarin. Give prothrombin complex concentrate 50 units/kg (if unavailable, give FFP 15mL/kg ≈1L for a 70kg man) and 5-10mg vitamin K IV. Discuss with haematologist. |

*Minor bleeding includes epistaxis.

Vitamin K may take several hours to work and can cause prolonged resistance when restarting warfarin, so should be avoided if possible when long-term anticoagulation is needed. Prothrombin complex concentrate contains a concentrate of factors II, VII, IX, and X and provides a more complete and rapid reversal of warfarin than FFP.
