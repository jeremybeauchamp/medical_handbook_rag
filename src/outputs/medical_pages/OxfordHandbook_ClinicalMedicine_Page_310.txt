# Urinary tract infection (UTI)

## Definitions
- **Bacteriuria**: Bacteria in the urine; may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Bacteriuria is not a disease.
- **UTI**: A diagnosis based on symptoms and signs. Tests which prove bacteria in urine may provide additional information. There is no 'gold-standard' bacterial count.
- **Lower UTI**: Bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis).
- **Upper UTI**: Pyelonephritis = infection of kidney/renal pelvis.
- **Abacterial cystitis/urethral syndrome**: A diagnosis of exclusion in patients with dysuria and frequency, without demonstrable infection.
- **Urethritis**: See pp412-3.

## Incidence
Annual incidence of UTI in women is 10-20%. 10% of men and 20% of women >65 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria (>65 years MSU is no longer diagnostic and clinical assessment is mandatory). Pyelonephritis = 3 per 1000 patient years.

## Classification
- **Uncomplicated**: normal renal tract structure and function.
- **Complicated**: structural/functional abnormality of genitourinary tract, eg obstruction, catheter, stones, neurogenic bladder, renal transplant.

## Risk factors
- **Bacterial inoculation**: Sexual activity, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, constipation.
- **Binding of uropathogenic bacteria**: Spermicide use, ↓oestrogen, menopause.
- **Urine flow**: Dehydration, obstructed urinary tract (p640).
- **Bacterial growth**: DM, immunosuppression, obstruction, stones, catheter, renal tract malformation, pregnancy.

## Symptoms
- **Cystitis**: Frequency, dysuria, urgency, suprapubic pain, polyuria, haematuria.
- **Acute pyelonephritis**: Fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral pain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock.
- **Prostatitis**: Pain: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis, bladder, lower back. Fever, malaise, nausea, urinary symptoms, swollen or tender prostate on PR. See p645.

## Signs
Fever, abdominal or loin tenderness. Check for a distended bladder, enlarged prostate. If vaginal discharge, consider PID, see p413.

> Do not rely on classical symptoms and signs in a catheterized patient.

## Tests
In non-pregnant women, if ≥3 (or one severe) symptoms of cystitis, and no vaginal discharge, treat empirically without further tests.

- **Dipstick**: Use in non-pregnant women <65 years with less than three symptoms. A negative dipstick reduces probability of UTI to <20%. Do not use in pregnant women. Limited data for men. No diagnostic value in catheterized sample.
- **MSU culture**: Conventional cut off >10⁵ colony-forming units (cfu)/mL (but best diagnostic criterion may be >10²-10³cfu/mL). Use in pregnant women, men, children, and if fail to respond to empirical antibiotics. Catheterized sample only if septic.
- **Blood tests**: If systemically unwell: FBC, U&E, CRP, and blood culture (positive in only 10-25% of pyelonephritis). Consider fasting glucose.
- **Imaging**: Consider USS and referral to urology for assessment (cystoscopy, urodynamics, CT) in men with upper UTI; failure to respond to treatment; recurrent UTI (>2/year); pyelonephritis; unusual organism; persistent haematuria.

## Organisms
Usually anaerobes and Gram-negative bacteria from bowel and vaginal flora. E. coli is the main organism (75-95% in community but ↓ in hospital). Staphylococcus saprophyticus (a skin commensal) in 5-10%. Other enterobacteriaceae such as Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumonia. For sterile pyuria see table 7.2.

| Infection related | Non-infection related |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| TB | Calculi | Polycystic kidney |
| Recently treated UTI | Renal tract tumour | Recent catheter |
| Inadequately treated UTI | Papillary necrosis | Pregnancy |
| Fastidious culture requirement | Tubulointerstitial nephritis | SLE |
| Appendicitis, prostatitis, chlamydia | Chemical cystitis | Drugs, eg steroids |
