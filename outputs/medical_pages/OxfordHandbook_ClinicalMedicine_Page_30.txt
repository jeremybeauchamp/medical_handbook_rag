# The older person

> "To know how to grow old is the master-work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living." Henri Amiel, Journal Intime, 21 Sept 1874.

**Ageing** is an inevitable and irreversible decline in organ function that occurs with time, in the absence of injury or illness, and despite the existence of complex pathways of maintenance and repair.

**Healthy ageing** is the maintenance of physical and mental abilities that enable well-being and independence in older age.

- Do not presume ageing. Look for preventable and reversible pathology. Old age does not cause disease (although it can increase vulnerability and recovery time).
- Look for ways to reduce disability and support older people in their own homes.

## Differences in the evaluation of the older person

1. **Multiple pathologies**: Elderly patients have, on average, six diagnosable disorders. Effects may be multiplicative. Treatment must be integrated.
2. **Multiple aetiologies**: One problem may have several causes, eg falls. Treating each alone may do little good, treating all may be of great benefit.
3. **Non-specific/atypical presentation**: Delirium, dizziness, falls, mobility problems, weight loss, and incontinence can be due to disorders in more than one organ system. Typical signs and symptoms may be absent. Ask about functional decline in activities of daily living—this may be the only symptom.
4. **Missed or delayed diagnosis**: The older person may decline quickly if treatment is delayed. Complications are common. Use a collateral history: what is the patient usually like?
5. **Pharmacy and polypharmacy**: NSAIDs, anticoagulants, anti-parkinson drugs, hypoglycaemic drugs, and psychoactive drugs can pose a particular risk in the older patient. Double check for interactions. Consider body weight, liver and renal function—drug doses may need to be modified. The STOPP/START criteria detail >100 potentially inappropriate prescriptions and prescribing omissions relevant to the older patient.²¹
6. **Prolonged recovery time**: Anticipate and plan for this. Don't forget nutrition.
7. **Rehabilitation and social factors**: Essential for healthy ageing.

## A quick ward assessment of the older person

**History**: In addition to routine elements, include function in activities of daily living, continence, and social support. Ask if there is an advanced care directive and nominated proxy healthcare decision maker.

**Examination**:
- Appearance and affect: hygiene, nutrition, hydration. Briefly assess mood.
- Senses: vision, hearing, assess swallowing with 20mL of water.
- Cognition: brief screening test, eg AMTS (p64), 2-step command.
- Pulse and blood pressure: lying/sitting and standing.
- Peripheral neurological exam: tone, power, wasting, active range of movement.
- Other periphery: pulses, oedema, skin integrity, pressure areas.
- Walking: stand patient, balance, transfers, observe gait (be ready to assist).
- Other systems: CV, respiratory, abdomen (don't forget to palpate for bladder).²²

## Falls

50% aged >80 will fall at least once per year. Falls²³ lead to injury, pain, distress, loss of confidence, loss of independence, and mortality. Cost to the NHS is £2.3bn/year.

- **History**: frequency, context and circumstances, severity, injuries.
- **Multifactorial risk assessment**: gait, balance, muscle strength, osteoporosis risk, perceived functional ability, fear of falls, vision, cognition, neurological examination, continence, home and hazards, cardiovascular examination, medication review.
- **Interventions**: strength and balance training, home hazard intervention, correct vision, modification/withdrawal of medication (cardiovascular, psychotropic), integrated management of contributing morbidities. Consider barriers to change, eg fear, patient preference.
