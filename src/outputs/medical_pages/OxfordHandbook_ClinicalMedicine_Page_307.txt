Renal disease presents as:

## 1 Asymptomatic disease

- **Non-visible haematuria**: (NVH, microscopic haematuria.) Detected on urine dipstick on repeated testing. Most is not due to renal disease and urological investigation is first-line for all those aged >40 years. See p294.

- **Asymptomatic proteinuria**: Normal renal protein excretion is less than 150mg/24 hours (non-pregnant). Quantification by 24h urine collection is unreliable and rarely used in clinical practice. A spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio (P:CR) >15mg/mmol or urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (A:CR) >2.5(♂) or 3.5(♀)mg/mmol may signify either glomerular (common) or tubular (rare) pathology.

- **Abnormal renal function (GFR)**: The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how much blood the kidneys are cleaning per minute. Direct measurement is invasive and time-consuming. Estimations derived from equations based on serum creatinine are widely used to give an eGFR (see p669). Errors in eGFR are caused by non-steady-state conditions, conditions which alter serum creatinine (diet, muscle mass), and eGFR is less accurate at higher levels of GFR. eGFR is therefore only part of the assessment of renal function.

- **High blood pressure**: A renal aetiology should be excluded if hypertension occurs with any indicators of renal disease: haematuria, proteinuria, eGFR.

- **Electrolyte abnormalities**: Disorders of sodium, potassium, and acid-base balance (pp301 and 670-5) may be due to underlying renal disease.

## 2 With renal tract symptoms

- **Urinary symptoms**: Dysuria is a sensation of discomfort with micturition and may be accompanied by urgency, frequency, and nocturia. UTI is the primary differential. Consider prostatic aetiology if there is difficulty initiating voiding, poor stream and dribbling. Oliguria (<400mL/24 hours or <0.5mL/kg/hour) and anuria should trigger assessment and investigation for acute kidney injury (AKI) (see pp298-301). Polyuria is the voiding of abnormally high volumes of urine, usually from high fluid intake. Consider also DM, diabetes insipidus (p240), hypercalcaemia (p676), renal medullary disorders (causing impaired concentration of urine).

- **Loin pain**: Ureteric colic is severe and radiates anteriorly and to the groin. It is caused by a renal stone, clot, or a sloughed papilla. For pain confined to the loin consider pyelonephritis, renal cyst pathology, and renal infarct.

- **Visible haematuria**: (VH, macroscopic.) Urological investigation is required to exclude renal tract malignancy. Nephrological causes include polycystic kidney disease and glomerular disease (IgA p311, anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease p311, Alport syndrome p320).

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Proteinuria >3g/24 hours (=P:CR >300mg/mmol) with hypoalbuminaemia (<30g/L) and peripheral oedema. Renal biopsy is usually indicated in adults (p310).

- **Symptomatic chronic kidney disease**: Dyspnoea, anorexia, weight loss, pruritus, bone pain, sexual dysfunction, cognitive decline (pp302-5).

## 3 A systemic disorder with renal involvement

- **DM**: (p314.)
- **Metabolic**: Sickle cell disease (p315), tuberous sclerosis (p320), Fabry disease (p320), cystinosis (p321).
- **Auto-immune**: ANCA-associated vasculitis (p314, 556), SLE (p314), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (p311), systemic sclerosis (p315), sarcoid (p318), Sjögren's syndrome (p318, 710).
- **Infection**: Sepsis is a common cause of AKI. Specific renal involvement may occur with TB (p392), malaria, chronic hepatitis (p278), HIV (pp398-403).
- **Malignancy**: Obstruction, hypercalcaemia, direct toxicity, eg myeloma (p314).
- **Pregnancy**: Pre-eclampsia, obstruction.
- **Drugs used in systemic disorders**: NSAIDs, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides, chemotherapy.
