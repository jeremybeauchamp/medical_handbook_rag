# Glomerulonephritis

The term glomerulonephritis (GN) encompasses a number of conditions which:
• are caused by pathology in the glomerulus
• present with proteinuria, haematuria, or both
• are diagnosed on a renal biopsy
• cause CKD
• can progress to kidney failure (except minimal change disease).

The names of the diseases come from either the histological appearance (eg membranous glomerulonephritis), or the associated systemic condition (eg lupus nephritis).

## Nephrotic or nephritic?

The glomerulonephritides classically present on a spectrum ranging from nephrosis (proteinuria due to podocyte pathology, p312), to nephritis (haematuria due to inflammatory damage, p311). This is illustrated in fig 7.10. However, if a GN causes scarring, then proteinuria can occur. Proteinuria can therefore complicate the longer-term clinical picture of any GN, including those that are classically 'nephritic'.

## Investigation
Assess damage and potential cause. Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP; immunoglobulins, electrophoresis, complement (C3, C4); autoantibodies (p553): ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM; blood culture, ASOT, hepatitis serology. Urine: MC&S, Bence Jones protein, A:CR/P:CR (p294), RBC casts (p295). Imaging: CXR (pulmonary haemorrhage), renal ultrasound (size and anatomy for biopsy). Renal biopsy: Required for diagnosis.

### Renal biopsy

**Pre-procedure:** BP (<160/95 or according to local protocol), FBC (Hb>9, plt>100), clotting (PT and APTT <1.2), G&S. Written informed consent including possible complications: mild back/loin pain, visible haematuria (~5%, usually clears), bleeding, need for transfusion (~1%), angiographic intervention (~ ≤0.5%). Stop anticoagulants (aspirin 1 week, warfarin to PT <1.2, low-molecular-weight heparin 24h).

**Post-procedure:** Bed rest for a minimum of 4h. Monitor pulse, BP, symptoms, and urine colour. Do not discharge home until macroscopic haematuria settled. Aspirin or warfarin can be restarted the next day if procedure uncomplicated.

**Result:** Examination of glomerular lesions provides GN diagnosis. Includes: proportion of glomeruli involved (focal vs diffuse), how much of each glomerulus is involved (segmental vs global), hypercellularity, sclerosis. Immunohistology for deposits (Ig, light chains, complement). Electron microscopy for ultrastructure: precise location of deposits, podocyte appearance. Also examines tubulointerstitium (atrophy, fibrosis, inflammation) and any vessels.

## Management
General management as for CKD (pp304-5) including BP control and inhibition of renin-angiotensin axis. Specific treatment including immunosuppression depends on histological diagnosis, disease severity, disease progression, and comorbidity.
