Legend:
- Motor fibres
- Sensory fibres
- Parasymp.(secretory fibres)
- Taste fibres

Fig 10.26 Facial nerve branches. The motor part moves the muscles of the face, scalp, and ears—also buccinator (puffs out the cheeks), platysma, stapedius, and the posterior belly of the digastric. It also contains the sympathetic motor fibres (vasodilator) of the submaxillary and sublingual glands (via the chorda tympani nerve). The sensory part contains the fibres of taste for the anterior ⅔ of the tongue and a few somatic sensory fibres from the middle ear region.

## Ramsay Hunt syndrome

Latent varicella zoster virus reactivating in the geniculate ganglion of the VIIth cranial nerve. Symptoms: Painful vesicular rash on the auditory canal ± on drum, pinna, tongue palate, or iris (→hyphaema, ie blood under the cornea) with ipsilateral facial palsy, loss of taste, vertigo, tinnitus, deafness, dry mouth and eyes. The rash may be subtle or even absent ('herpes sine herpete'=herpes without herpes). Incidence: ~5/100 000 (higher if >60yrs). Diagnosis: Clinical, as antiviral treatment is thought to be most effective within the 1st 72h, while the virus is replicating. ℞: Antivirals (eg aciclovir 800mg PO 5× daily for 7d) + prednisolone, as for Bell's palsy. Prognosis: If treated within 72h, ~75% recover well; if not, ~⅓ make a good recovery, ⅓ a reasonable recovery, and ⅓ a poor recovery.
