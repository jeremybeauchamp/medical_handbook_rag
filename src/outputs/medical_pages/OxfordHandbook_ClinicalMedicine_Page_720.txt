## Marfan's syndrome (table 15.3)
Autosomal dominant disorder (fibrillin-1) with extracellular microfibril formation; but ~25% have no family history. Major criteria: (Diagnostic if >2): lens dislocation (ectopia lentis; fig 15.9); aortic dissection/dilatation; dural ectasia; skeletal features: arachnodactyly (long spidery fingers), armspan > height, pectus deformity, scoliosis, pes planus. Minor signs: Mitral valve prolapse, high-arched palate, joint hypermobility. Diagnosis is clinical; MRI for dural ectasia. ℞: The danger is aortic dissection: β-blockers slow dilatation of the aortic root. Annual echos, surgical repair when aortic diameter is >5cm. In pregnancy risk of dissection. Homocystinuria has similar skeletal deformities.

Antoine Bernard-Jean Marfan, 1858-1942 (French paediatrician)

### Table 15.3 Comparing Marfan's and homocystinuria

| Marfan's | vs | Homocystinuria |
|----------|:--:|----------------|
| Upwards lens dislocation | | Downwards lens dislocation |
| Aortic valve incompetence | | Heart rarely affected |
| Normal intelligence | | Mental retardation |
| Scoliosis, flat feet, herniae | | Recurrent thromboses, osteoporosis |
| Life expectancy is lower due to cardiovascular risks | | Positive urine cyanide-nitroprusside test |
| | | Response to treatment with pyridoxine |

## Meckel's diverticulum
The distal ileum contains embryonic remnants of gastric and pancreatic tissue. There may be gastric acid secretion, causing GI pain & occult bleeding. ∆: Radionucleotide scan; laparotomy.

Johann Friedrich Meckel, 1781-1833 (German anatomist)

## Meigs' syndrome
A triad of 1 benign ovarian tumour (fibroma) 2 pleural effusion (R>L) & 3 ascites. It resolves on tumour resection.

Joe Vincent Meigs, 1892-1963 (US gynaecologist)

## Ménétrier's disease
Giant gastric mucosal folds up to 4cm high, in the fundus, with atrophy of the glands + mucosal thickness + hypochlorhydria + protein-losing gastropathy (hence hypoalbuminaemia ± oedema). Causes: CMV, strep, H. pylori. There may be epigastric pain, vomiting, ± ↓weight. It is pre-malignant. ℞: Treat H. pylori or CMV if present; give high-dose PPI; if this fails, consider epidermal growth factor blockade with cetuximab or gastrectomy (eg if intractable symptoms or malignant change). Epidermal growth factor receptor blockade with cetuximab is 1st-line treatment.55 Surgery if intractable symptoms or malignant change.

Pierre Eugène Ménétrier, 1859-1935 (French pathologist)

## Meyer-Betz syndrome
(Paroxysmal myoglobinuria.) Rare idiopathic condition causing necrosis of exercising muscles. There is muscle pain, weakness, and discoloured urine: pink-brown (as myoglobin is excreted). Acute kidney injury can result from myoglobinuria (p319). DIC is associated. Tests: ↑WCC, ↑LFT, ↑LDH, ↑CPK, ↑urine myoglobin. Diagnosis: Muscle biopsy, ↑CPK, and ↑serum myoglobin. Exertion should be avoided.

Friedrich Meyer-Betz, described 1910 (German physician)

## Mikulicz's syndrome
Benign persistent swelling of lacrimal and parotid (or submandibular) glands due to lymphocytic infiltration. Exclude other causes (sarcoidosis, TB, viral infection, lymphoproliferative disorders). It is thought to be an IgG4-related plasmacytic systemic disease.56

Johann Freiherr von Mikulicz-Radecki, 1850-1905 (Polish-Austrian surgeon)

## Milroy disease
1° congenital lymphoedema. Mutations in the VEGFR3 gene (dominant) cause lymphatic malfunction with lower leg swelling from birth (fig 15.10). ∆: Lymphoscintigraphy; genetic testing. ℞: •Compression hosiery/bandages. •Encourage exercise. •Good skin hygiene. •Treat cellulitis actively.

William Forsyth Milroy, 1855-1942 (US physician)

## Münchausen's syndrome
Vivid liars, who are addicted to institutions, flit from hospital to hospital, feigning illness, eg hoping for a laparotomy or mastectomy, or they complain of awful bleeding, odd eye movements, curious fits, sexual assaults, throat closings, false asthma, or heart attacks. Münchausen-by-proxy entails injury to a dependent person by a carer (eg mother) to gain medical attention.

Karl Friedrich Hieronymus, Freiherr von Münchausen, 1720-1797 (German aristocrat). Described by RAJ Asher in 195157

## Ogilvie's syndrome
(Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.) Colonic obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause, associated with recent severe illness or surgery. ℞: Correct U&E. Colonoscopy allows decompression, and excludes mechanical causes. Neostigmine is also effective, suggesting parasympathetic suppression is to blame.58 Surgery is rarely needed (eg if perforation).

William Heneage Ogilvie, 1887-1971 (British surgeon)
