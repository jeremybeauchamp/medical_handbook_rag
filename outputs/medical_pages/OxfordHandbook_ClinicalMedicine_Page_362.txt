# Blood transfusion and blood products

Blood should only be given if strictly necessary and there is no alternative. Outcomes may be worse after an inappropriate transfusion.

- Know and use local procedures to ensure that the right blood gets to the right patient at the right time.
- Take blood for crossmatching from only one patient at a time. Label immediately. This minimizes risk of wrong labelling of samples.
- When giving blood, monitor TPR and BP every ½h.
- Use a dedicated line where practicable (or dedicated lumen of multilumen line).

## Group-and-save (G&S) requests
Know your local guidelines for elective surgery. Having crossmatched blood to hand may not be needed if a blood sample is already in the lab, with group determined, without any atypical antibodies (ie G&S).

## Products
- **Whole blood**: The only option for the first 250 years of transfusion history, but now rarely used.
- **Red cells**: (Packed to make haematocrit ~70%.) Use to correct anaemia or blood loss. 1U ↑ Hb by 10-15g/L. In anaemia, transfuse until Hb ~80g/L.
- **Platelets**: (p364.) Usually only needed if bleeding or count is <20 × 10⁹/L. 1U should ↑platelet count by >20 × 10⁹/L. Failure to do so suggests refractory cause: discuss with haematologist. If surgery is planned, get advice if count is <100 × 10⁹/L.
- **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)**: Use to correct clotting defects: eg DIC (p352); warfarin overdosage where vitamin K would be too slow; liver disease; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (p315). It is expensive and carries all the risks of blood transfusion. Do not use as a simple volume expander.
- **Human albumin solution** is produced as 4.5% or 20% protein solution and is used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be used temporarily in the hypoproteinaemic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who is fluid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load. Also used as replacement in abdominal paracentesis (p765).
- **Others**: Cryoprecipitate (a source of fibrinogen); coagulation concentrates (self-injected in haemophilia); immunoglobulins.

## Complications of transfusion
Management of acute reactions: see BOX 'Transfusion reactions' and table 8.4.

- **Early (within 24h)**: Acute haemolytic reactions (eg ABO or Rh incompatibility); anaphylaxis; bacterial contamination; febrile reactions (eg from HLA antibodies); allergic reactions (itch, urticaria, mild fever); fluid overload; transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI, ie ARDS due to antileucocyte antibodies in donor plasma).
- **Delayed (after 24h)**: Infections (eg viruses: hepatitis B/C, HIV; bacteria; protozoa; prions); iron overload (treatment, p342); GVHD; post-transfusion purpura—potentially lethal fall in platelet count 5-7d post-transfusion requiring specialist treatment with IV immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions.

## Massive blood transfusion
This is defined as replacement of an individual's entire blood volume (>10U) within 24h. Complications: ↓Ca²⁺; ↓platelets; ↓clotting factors; ↑K⁺; hypothermia. Seek early and ongoing support from haematologist and blood bank who should advise on products and monitoring. In acute haemorrhage, use crossmatched blood if possible, but if not, use 'universal donor' group O Rh−ve blood, changing to crossmatched blood as soon as possible.

## Transfusing patients with heart failure
If Hb ≤50g/L with heart failure, transfusion with packed red cells is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60-80g/L, but must be done with care. Give each unit over 4h with furosemide (eg 40mg slow IV/PO; don't mix with blood) with alternate units. Check for JVP and basal lung crackles; consider CVP line.

## Autologous transfusion
There is a role for patients having their own blood stored pre-op for later use. Erythropoietin (EPO, p304) can increase the yield of autologous blood in normal people. Intraoperative cell salvage with retransfusion is also being used more often, especially in cardiac, vascular, and emergency surgery. Cost-analysis shows that it may be worthwhile on an economic basis alone.
