# Epilepsy: diagnosis

Epilepsy is a recurrent tendency to spontaneous, intermittent, abnormal electrical activity in part of the brain, manifesting as seizures. Convulsions are the motor signs of electrical discharges.

## Elements of a seizure
Some patients may experience a preceding prodrome lasting hours or days in which there may be a change in mood or behaviour. An aura implies a focal seizure, often, but not necessarily, from the temporal lobe. It may be a strange feeling in the gut, an experience such as déjà vu or strange smells or flashing lights. Post-ictally there may be headache, confusion, and myalgia; or temporary weakness after a focal seizure in the motor cortex (Todd's palsy, p712), or dysphasia following a focal seizure in the temporal lobe.

## Causes
⅔ are idiopathic. Structural: Cortical scarring (eg head injury years before onset), developmental (eg dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour or cortical dysgenesis), space-occupying lesion, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis (eg after a febrile convulsion), vascular malformations. Others: Tuberous sclerosis, sarcoidosis, SLE, PAN, antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels.

## Diagnosis
Can be difficult due to the heterogenous nature of the disease (there are >40 different types of epilepsy). NICE estimate 5-30% of people with 'epilepsy' have been wrongly diagnosed. All patients with a seizure must be referred for specialist assessment and investigation in <2 wks.

### Take a thorough history:
Including a detailed description from a witness. Ask specifically about tongue-biting and a slow recovery. If this is a first seizure, enquire about past funny turns/odd behaviour. Déjà vu and odd episodic feelings of fear may well be relevant. Are there any triggers (eg alcohol, stress, flickering lights/TV)? Triggered attacks tend to recur.

### Establish the type of seizure:
See BOX 'Seizure classification.' NB: if a seizure begins with focal features, it is a partial seizure, however rapidly it then generalizes. Don't forget non-epileptic attack disorder (= 'pseudo' seizures—psychogenic): this is not uncommon. (Suspect if seizures have a gradual onset, prolonged duration, and abrupt termination and are accompanied by closed eyes ± resistance to eye opening, rapid breathing, fluctuating motor activity, and episodes of motionless unresponsiveness. CNS exam, CT, MRI, and EEG are normal. It may coexist with true epilepsy.)

### Rule out provoking causes:
Most people would have a seizure given sufficient provocation (eg reflex anoxic seizures in faints) but would not be classed as epileptic: only 3-10% of provoked seizures recur; generally when the provocation is irreversible. Causes: trauma; stroke; haemorrhage; ↑ICP; alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal; metabolic disturbance (hypoxia, ↓Na+, ↓Ca2+, ↓glucose, uraemia, liver disease); infection (eg meningitis, encephalitis); ↑T°; drugs (tricyclics, cocaine). Unprovoked seizures have a recurrence rate of 30-50%.

## Investigations
Look for provoking causes. Consider an EEG: it cannot exclude epilepsy and can be falsely +ve, so don't do one if simple syncope is the likely diagnosis. Only do emergency EEGs if non-convulsive status is the problem. Other tests: MRI (structural lesions); drug levels (if on anti-epileptics: is the patient compliant?); drugs screen; LP (eg if infection suspected).

## Counselling
After any 'fit', advise about dangers, eg swimming, driving, heights until the diagnosis is known; then give individualized counselling on employment, sport, insurance, and conception (OHCS p28). The patient must contact DVLA and avoid driving until seizure-free for >1yr (p159).
