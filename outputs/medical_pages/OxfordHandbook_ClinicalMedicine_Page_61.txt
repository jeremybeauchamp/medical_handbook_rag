## Grading intensity of heart murmurs

The following grading is commonly used for murmurs—systolic murmurs from 1 to 6 and diastolic murmurs from 1 to 4, never being clinically >4/6.

Table 2.4 Grading of heart murmurs.

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1/6   | Very soft, only heard after listening for a while |
| 2/6   | Soft, but detectable immediately |
| 3/6   | Clearly audible, but no thrill palpable |
| 4/6   | Clearly audible, palpable thrill |
| 5/6   | Audible with stethoscope only partially touching chest |
| 6/6   | Can be heard without placing stethoscope on chest |

## Prosthetic valve murmurs

Prosthetic valves: Created either from synthetic material (mechanical prosthesis) or from biological tissue (bioprosthesis). The choice of prosthesis is determined by the anticipated longevity of the patient and the patient's ability to tolerate anticoagulation. Three mechanical valve designs exist: the caged ball valve, the tilting disc (single leaflet) valve, and the bileaflet valve. Tissue valves are made from porcine valves or bovine pericardium.

Prosthetic aortic valves: All types produce a degree of outflow obstruction and thus have an ESM. The intensity of this murmur increases as the valve fails. Ball and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards) and tissue valves do close completely in diastole and so any diastolic murmur implies valve failure.

Prosthetic mitral valves: Ball and cage valves project into the left ventricle and can cause a low-intensity ESM as they interfere with the ejected stream. Tissue valves and bileaflet valves can have a low-intensity diastolic murmur. Consider any systolic murmur of loud intensity to be a sign of regurgitation and ∴ failure.

## Eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation

- de Musset's sign—head nodding in time with the pulse.
- Müller's sign—systolic pulsations of the uvula.
- Corrigan's sign—visible carotid pulsations.
- Quincke's sign—capillary nailbed pulsation in the fingers.
- Traube's sign—'pistol shot' femorals, a booming sound heard over the femorals.
- Duroziez's sign—to and fro diastolic murmur heard when compressing the femorals proximally with the stethoscope.
