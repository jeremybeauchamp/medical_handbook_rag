# Dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease

## War
The stomach is a battle ground between the forces of attack (acid, pepsin, Helicobacter pylori, bile salts) and defence (mucin secretion, cellular mucus, bicarbonate secretion, mucosal blood flow, cell turnover). Gastric antisecretory agents, eg H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may only work if you have optimized cytoprotection (antacids and sucralfate work this way). Success may depend on you being not just a brilliant general, but also a tactician, politician, and diplomat. Plan your strategy carefully⁴ (fig 6.14). As in any war, neglecting psychological factors can prove disastrous. The aim is not outright victory but maintaining the balance of power so all may prosper.

## Symptoms
Epigastric pain often related to hunger, specific foods, or time of day, fullness after meals, heartburn (retrosternal pain); tender epigastrium. Beware Alarm symptoms: Anaemia (iron deficiency); loss of weight; anorexia; recent onset/progressive symptoms; melaena/haematemesis; swallowing difficulty.

## H. pylori
(See table 6.5.) If ≤55yrs old: 'Test and treat' for H.pylori⁶ if +ve give appropriate PPI and 2 antibiotic combination, eg lansoprazole 30mg/12h PO, clarithromycin 250mg/12h PO, and amoxicillin 1g/12h PO for 1wk. If -ve give acid suppression alone. ▶Refer for urgent endoscopy (p248) all with dysphagia, as well as those ≥55 with alarm symptoms or with treatment-refractory dyspepsia.

## Duodenal ulcer
(DU, fig 6.15.) 4-fold commoner than GU. Major risk factors: H.pylori (90%); drugs (NSAIDs; steroids; SSRI). Minor: ↑Gastric acid secretion; ↑gastric emptying (↓duodenal pH); blood group O; smoking.

Symptoms: Asymptomatic or epigastric pain (relieved by antacids) ± ↓weight. Signs: Epigastric tenderness. Diagnosis: Upper GI endoscopy. Test for H.pylori. Measure gastrin concentrations when off PPIs if Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (p716) is suspected. ∆∆: Non-ulcer dyspepsia; duodenal Crohn's; TB; lymphoma; pancreatic cancer (p270). Follow-up: None; if good response to Rx (eg PPI).

## Gastric ulcers
(GU.) Occur mainly in the elderly, on the lesser curve. Ulcers elsewhere are more often malignant. Risk factors: H.pylori (~80%); smoking; NSAIDs; reflux of duodenal contents; delayed gastric emptying; stress, eg neurosurgery or burns (Cushing's or Curling's ulcers). Symptoms: Asymptomatic or epigastric pain (relieved by antacids) ± ↓weight. Tests: Upper GI endoscopy to exclude malignancy (fig 6.14); multiple biopsies from ulcer rim and base (histology, H.pylori). Repeat endoscopy after 6-8 weeks to confirm healing and exclude malignancy.

## Gastritis
Risk factors: Alcohol, NSAIDs, H. pylori, reflux/hiatus hernia, atrophic gastritis, granulomas (Crohn's; sarcoidosis), CMV, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome & Ménétrier's disease (p716 & 706). Symptoms: Epigastric pain, vomiting; Tests: Upper GI endoscopy only if suspicious features (fig 6.14).

## Treatment
Lifestyle: ↓Alcohol and tobacco.

H.pylori eradication: Triple therapy is 80-85% effective at eradication.⁷

Drugs to reduce acid: PPIs are effective, eg lansoprazole 30mg/24h PO for 4 (DU) or 8 (GU) wks. H₂ blockers have a place (ranitidine 300mg each night PO for 8wks).

Drug-induced ulcers: Stop drug if possible. PPIs may be best for treating and preventing GI ulcers and bleeding in patients on NSAID or antiplatelet drugs. Misoprostol is an alternative with different SE. If symptoms persist, re-endoscope, retest for H.pylori, and reconsider differential diagnoses (eg gallstones). Surgery: See p622.

## Complications
▶Bleeding (p256), ▶perforation (p606), malignancy, ↓gastric outflow.

## Functional (non-ulcer) dyspepsia
Common. H.pylori eradication (only after a +ve result) may help. Some evidence favours PPIs and psychotherapy. Low-dose amitriptyline (10-20mg each night PO) may help. Antacids, antispasmodics, H₂ blockers, misoprostol, prokinetic agents, bismuth, or sucralfate all have less evidence.

6 H. pylori is the commonest bacterial pathogen found worldwide (>50% of the world population over 40yrs has it). It's a class I carcinogen causing gastritis (p252), duodenal/gastric ulcers & gastric cancer/lymphoma (MALT, p362), also associated with coronary artery disease, B₁₂ and iron deficiency.

7 1 week of therapy sufficient; 2 weeks increases erradication rates by ~5% but also increases SE. For resistant infections switch to a 2nd-line antibiotic combination (see BNF).
