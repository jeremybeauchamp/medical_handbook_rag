# Management of acute heart failure

1. Sit the patient upright

2. High-flow oxygen if SpO2*

3. IV access and monitor ECG
   Treat any arrhythmias, eg AF (pp124-31)

4. Investigations whilst continuing treatment
   See p800

5. Diamorphine 1.25-5mg IV slowly
   Caution in liver failure and COPD

6. Furosemide 40-80mg IV slowly
   Larger doses required in renal failure

7. GTN spray 2 puffs SL or 2 × 0.3mg tablets SL
   Don't give if systolic BP <90mmHg

8. Necessary investigations, examination, and history

9. If systolic BP ≥100mmHg, start a nitrate infusion,
   eg isosorbide dinitrate 2-10mg/h IVI; keep systolic BP ≥90mmHg

10. If the patient is worsening:
    - Further dose of furosemide 40-80mg
    - Consider CPAP—improves ventilation by recruiting more alveoli, driving fluid out
      of alveolar spaces and into vasculature (get help before initiating!)
    - Increase nitrate infusion if able to do so without dropping systolic BP <100mmHg
    - Consider alternative diagnoses, eg hypertensive heart failure, aortic dissection,
      pulmonary embolism, pneumonia

11. If systolic BP <100mmHg, treat as cardiogenic shock (p802) and refer to ICU

*Avoid supplemental oxygen if not hypoxaemic since may cause vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac output. If known COPD, hypoxaemia still needs correcting: give high-flow oxygen but monitor closely for CO2 retention (check serial ABG if needed) and reduce flow as soon as possible.
