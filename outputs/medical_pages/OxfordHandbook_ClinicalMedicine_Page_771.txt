# Some important drug interactions

See BNF.

See p689 for a list of cytochrome P450 inducers and inhibitors. Note: '↑' = effect of drug increased; '↓' = effect decreased.

## Drugs

**Adenosine:** ↓ by: aminophylline. ↑ by: dipyridamole.

**Aminoglycosides:** ↑ by: loop diuretics.

**Antidiabetic drugs:** (All) ↑ by: alcohol, β-blockers, bezafibrate, monoamine oxidase inhibitors. ↓ by: contraceptive steroids, corticosteroids, diazoxide, diuretics, (possibly also lithium).
- Metformin ↑ by: cimetidine. With alcohol: lactic acidosis risk.
- Sulfonylureas ↑ by: azapropazone, chloramphenicol, bezafibrate, co-trimoxazole, miconazole, sulfinpyrazone. ↓ by: rifampicin (nifedipine occasionally).

**Antiretroviral agents (HIV):** See p402.

**Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors:** ↓ by: NSAIDs, oestrogens.

**Antihistamines:** Avoid anything that ↑concentrations and risk of arrhythmias, eg anti-arrhythmics, antifungals, antipsychotics, β-blockers, diuretics, halofantrine, macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, azithromycin, etc), protease inhibitors (p402), SSRIs (p448), tricyclics.

**Azathioprine:** ↑ by: allopurinol.

**β-blockers:** Avoid verapamil. ↓ by: NSAIDs. Lipophilic β-blockers (eg propranolol) are metabolized by the liver, and concentrations are ↑ by cimetidine. This does not happen with hydrophilic β-blockers (eg atenolol).

**Carbamazepine:** ↑ by: erythromycin, isoniazid, verapamil.

**Ciclosporin:** ↑ by: erythromycin, grapefruit juice, nifedipine. ↓ by: phenytoin.

**Cimetidine:** ↑ the effect of: amitriptyline, lidocaine, metronidazole, pethidine, phenytoin, propranolol, quinine, theophylline, warfarin.

**Contraceptive steroids:** ↓ by: antibiotics, barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin.

**Digoxin:** ↑ by: amiodarone, carbenoxolone and diuretics (due to ↓K+), quinine, verapamil.

**Diuretics:** ↓ by: NSAIDs—particularly indometacin.

**Ergotamine:** ↑ by: erythromycin (ergotism may occur).

**Fluconazole:** Avoid concurrent astemizole.

**Lithium:** ↑ by: thiazide diuretics.

**Methotrexate:** ↑ by: aspirin, NSAIDs. Many antibiotics (check BNF).

**Phenytoin:** ↑ by: chloramphenicol, cimetidine, disulfiram, isoniazid, sulfonamides. ↓ by: carbamazepine.

**Potassium-sparing diuretics with ACE-inhibitors:** Hyperkalaemia.

**Theophyllines:** ↑ by: cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, contraceptive steroids, propranolol. ↓ by: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin. See p810.

**Valproate:** ↓ by: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin.

**Warfarin and nicoumalone:** (Nicoumalone=acenocoumarol) ↑ by: alcohol, allopurinol, amiodarone, aspirin, chloramphenicol, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, danazol, dipyridamole, disulfiram, erythromycin (and broad-spectrum antibiotics), gemfibrozil, glucagon, ketoconazole, metronidazole, miconazole, nalidixic acid, neomycin, NSAIDs, phenytoin, quinidine, simvastatin (but not pravastatin), sulfinpyrazone, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, levothyroxine.

**Warfarin and nicoumalone:** ↓ by: aminoglutethimide, barbiturates, carbamazepine, contraceptive steroids, dichloralphenazone, griseofulvin, rifampicin, phenytoin, vitamin K.

**Zidovudine (AZT):** ↑ by: paracetamol (marrow toxicity).

## IVI solutions to avoid

**Glucose:** Avoid furosemide, ampicillin, hydralazine, insulin, melphalan, phenytoin, and quinine.

**0.9% saline:** Avoid amphotericin, lidocaine, nitroprusside.
