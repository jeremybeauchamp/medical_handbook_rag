## Cardiorespiratory arrest

- Ensure the safety of the patient and yourself.
- Confirm diagnosis: a patient who is unresponsive and not breathing properly is in cardiac arrest (a manual pulse check is inaccurate and not recommended).

### Basic life support
Shout for help. Ask someone to call the arrest team and bring the defibrillator. Note the time. ABC:

- **Airway**: Head tilt (if no spine injury) and chin lift/jaw thrust.
- **Breathing**: Look, listen, and feel for breathing for no more than 10 seconds. If there is any doubt whether breathing is normal, proceed to chest compressions.
- **Chest compressions**: Place the heel of one hand on the centre of the chest (lower half of the sternum). Place your second hand on top and interlock fingers. Use straight arms. Give compressions at a rate of 100-120/min. Aim to compress the sternum 5-6cm. After 30 compressions give 2 rescue breaths. Do not interrupt compressions >10s. Continue with a ratio of 30:2 until defibrillator is available.

### Advanced life support
See algorithm fig A3.

- Continue chest compressions while adhesive defibrillation/monitoring pads are put in place. Plan all actions before pausing chest compressions.
- Stop chest compression for <5s to assess rhythm. Determine whether the rhythm is shockable (VF/pulseless VT) or non-shockable (asystole, pulseless electrical activity).

#### Shockable rhythm: VF/pulseless VT

- A single person performs uninterrupted chest compressions while everyone else prepares for defibrillation: stand clear, move oxygen delivery device 1m away.
- Select the appropriate energy on the defibrillator (150J or manufacturer's guidelines). When defibrillator is charged and safety check complete, the rescuer performing chest compressions stands clear and the shock is delivered.
- CPR is resumed immediately (30:2). Reassess pulse/rhythm only after 2 minutes of CPR.
- Repeat if shockable rhythm remains. Give drugs after 3 shocks (see Drugs, this topic).

#### Non-shockable rhythm: asystole/pulseless electrical activity (PEA)

- Continue CPR 30:2. Obtain IV access and secure airway. Once airway secure switch to continuous compressions and ventilation. Give adrenaline 1mg IV.
- Check rhythm every 2 minutes.
- Consider reversible causes (4Hs and 4Ts: hypoxia, hypovolaemia, hyper/hypokalaemia/other metabolic derangement, hypothermia, thrombosis, tension pneumothorax, tamponade, toxins).

### Drugs

- Give adrenaline 1mg IV every 3-5 mins for both shockable (from 3rd shock) and non-shockable rhythms. In practice this means at every other rhythm check or shock.ยน
- In shockable rhythms give amiodarone 300mg IV after 3 defibrillation attempts. Consider a further 150mg IV after 5 shocks. Lidocaine is an alternative.

### Discontinuing resuscitation
Needs clinical judgement: what is the likelihood of achieving a successful return of spontaneous circulation? If there is a shockable rhythm or a reversible cause then attempts are usually continued. It is reasonable to discontinue if asystole >20mins without a reversible cause. Ask for the opinion of others in the resuscitation team.

### Resuscitation decisions
Consider, discuss, and record CPR decisions:

- at the request of a patient with capacity
- as part of end-of-life care (p12, p536)
- in deteriorating, severe illness.

Your patient should be involved in decisions about CPR (unless it would cause physical or psychological harm). Explain your clinical decision to them, including futility.

Do not make judgements about the quality of life of others based on your own perception.

ยน Meta-analysis fails to show that adrenaline increases survival to hospital discharge (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24193240). RCT results are awaited (Paramedic 2: The Adrenaline Trial ISRCTN 73485024).
