## Investigating suspected PE

Diagnosis of PE is improved by adopting a stepwise approach, combining an objective probability score, with subsequent investigations, as follows.

Assess the clinical probability of a PE: Many systems exist and one of the most frequently used is the modified Wells Criteria (table 4.8).

### Table 4.8 Modified two-level PE Wells score

| Feature | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT (leg pain and pain on deep palpation of veins) | 3 |
| Heart rate >100 beats per minute | 1.5 |
| Recently bed-ridden (>3 days) or major surgery (<4 weeks) | 1.5 |
| Previous DVT or PE | 1.5 |
| Haemoptysis | 1 |
| Cancer receiving active treatment , treated in last 6/12, palliative | 1 |
| An alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE | 3 |

Score <4 = PE unlikely; score >4 = PE likely

    A[PE suspected] --> B[Calculate modified Wells score]
    B --> C[Score >4: immediate CTPA or treat empirically (LMWH) if delay]
    B --> D[Score <4: do D-dimer]
    D --> E[D dimer +ve: immediate CTPA or empiral treatment LMWH]
    D --> F[D-dimer -ve: consider alternative diagnosis]
```

### Length of treatment
- Provoked: 3 months and then reassess risk to benefit profile (depends on whether risk factor persists)
- Unprovoked: treatment is usually continued for >3 months (people with no identifiable risk factor)
- Malignancy: continue treatment with LMWH for 6 months or until cure of cancer
- Pregnancy: LMWH is continued until delivery/end of pregnancy

## Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

Oral alternatives to warfarin (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) have been available for treatment of PE since NICE approval in 2012. They have a rapid onset of action (without the need for LMWH overlap) and can be administered in fixed doses without the need for continuous monitoring. Monitoring is required to assess compliance, side effects (eg bleeding), and presence of VTE. Antidotes for DOACs are becoming available and in the USA idarucizumab is already licensed.
