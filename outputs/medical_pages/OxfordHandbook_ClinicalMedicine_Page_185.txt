Fig 4.6 PA chest radiograph showing multiple rounded ring lesions of differing sizes in the right lower zone, at the right apex, and in the left lower zone. The lesions are largest in the right lower zone, where they can be seen to contain air-fluid levels, typical appearance of infection in a pneumatocele (=air cyst) or cavitating lesion. A moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax can also be seen, suggesting that one of these lesions may have ruptured into the pleural cavity. The patient also has a right subclavian central venous catheter for the administration of antibiotics. The diagnosis in this case was that of multiple pulmonary abscesses in a patient who was an intravenous drug user.

The image shows a PA (posteroanterior) chest X-ray. The radiograph displays:

1. Multiple rounded ring lesions of varying sizes:
   - Located in the right lower zone
   - Present at the right apex
   - Visible in the left lower zone

2. Largest lesions in the right lower zone:
   - Contain air-fluid levels
   - Typical appearance of infection in a pneumatocele or cavitating lesion

3. Moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax:
   - Suggests possible rupture of one of the lesions into the pleural cavity

4. Right subclavian central venous catheter:
   - Used for antibiotic administration

5. Diagnosis:
   - Multiple pulmonary abscesses
   - Patient identified as an intravenous drug user

The radiograph provides visual evidence of severe lung infection with multiple complications, consistent with the clinical history of intravenous drug use.
