# Palliative care: principles and pain

> You matter because you are you and you matter to the last moment of your life.
> We will do all we can to help you, not only to die peacefully, but to live until you die.

Palliative care is the active, holistic care of patients with advanced progressive illness. It combines management of pain and other symptoms, with the provision of psychological, social, and spiritual support.

Palliative care is not just for the end of life and it is not just for patients with cancer.

Palliative care should run in parallel with other medical treatments. Good symptom control is important in any disease for improving quality of life and may even prolong survival. Take time to find out exactly what is troubling your patient using a problem-based approach. Consider:

- physical
- psychological
- spiritual
- social.

Remember, each person comes with a set of emotions, preconceptions, and a family already attached. Most hospitals now have a dedicated palliative care team for help and advice (including out of hours). Use their expertise.

## Assessment of pain

Pain is one of the most feared sequelae of a terminal diagnosis and yet it is not inevitable. However, pain is a complex phenomenon. While the aim of management is for the patient to be pain free, this may not be achievable in all cases so do not promise this.

Do not assume a cause: detailed history and examination are needed to understand aetiology, which will guide subsequent treatment, eg pain from nerve infiltration or local pressure may respond better to agents other than opioids. History and examination are essential for all patients, including those at the end of life. Evaluate severity, nature, functional deficit, and psychological state as all of these contribute to the symptom burden.

## Management of pain

Aim to modify the underlying pathology where possible, eg radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery. Use analgesia to relieve background pain and provide additional PRN doses for 'breakthrough' pain. Effective analgesia is possible in the majority of patients by combining five principles:

1. By the mouth—give orally whenever possible.
2. By the clock—give at fixed intervals to offer continuous relief.
3. By the ladder—following the WHO stepwise approach (see fig 13.5, p575).
4. For the individual—there are no standard doses for opioids, needs vary.
5. Attention to detail—communicate, set times carefully, warn of side-effects.

### The WHO analgesic ladder

Increase and decrease the analgesia required according to the 'steps' on the ladder (fig 13.5, p575):

1. Non-opioid, eg paracetamol.
2. Opioid for mild to moderate pain, eg codeine.
3. Opioid for moderate to severe pain, eg morphine, diamorphine, oxycodone.

- Persisting/increasing pain and side-effects inform the decision to step up and step down. Take one step at a time to achieve pain relief without toxicity (except in new, severe pain when step 2 may be omitted).
- Paracetamol (PO/PR/IV) at step 1 may have an opiate-sparing effect, and should be continued at steps 2 and 3. Stop step 2 opioids if moving to step 3.
- Use laxatives and anti-emetics with strong opioids.
- Adjuvants which can be added at all steps include: NSAIDs, amitriptyline, pregabalin, corticosteroids, nerve block, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), radiotherapy.
