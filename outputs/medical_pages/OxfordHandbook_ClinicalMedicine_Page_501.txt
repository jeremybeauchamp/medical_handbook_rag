# Who will care for the carers?

Our ageing population and improvements in medicine mean that we not only have an increasing number of people with dementia in the UK, but that those people are living longer with the disease in more advanced stages. Their needs become more complex and they become increasingly dependent. Currently, informal (mostly family) carers of people with dementia save the UK Â£11 billion a year. Yet this is not an easy task: most dementia sufferers display behavioural or psychological symptoms, which can be particularly distressing for the carer. Carer stress is inevitable and causes morbidity and mortality. Ameliorate this with:

- A care coordinator (via Social Services or the local Old Age Community Mental Healthcare Team); vital to coordinate the various teams and services available:

| Services                                                   | Benefits                           |
|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Laundry services for soiled linen                          | Attendance allowance               |
| Car badge giving priority parking                          | Respite care in hospital           |
| Help from occupational therapist, district nurses, and community psychiatric nurses | Council tax rebate (forms from local council office) |

- Day services can be invaluable for stimulating patients and providing regular, much-needed breaks for carers.

- Moral support: Support groups, telephone helplines, and charities can all ease the burden, eg UK Alzheimer's Disease Society.

- Combatting challenging behaviour: First rule out pain, infection, and depression. Then consider trazodone (50-300mg at night) or lorazepam (0.5-1mg/12-24h PO). Haloperidol (0.5-4mg) can be useful in the short term.
