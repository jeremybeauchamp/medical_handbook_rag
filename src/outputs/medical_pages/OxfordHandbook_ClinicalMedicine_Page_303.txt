# A bit about iron metabolism

60% of body iron is in haemoglobin, and erythropoiesis requires ~5-30mg iron/dayâ€”provided by macrophages (recycling of haeme iron after phagocytosis of old RBCs). Intestinal iron absorption (1-2mg/day) compensates for daily iron losses. Red meats, liver, seafoods, enriched breakfast cereals and pulses, and some spices (eg paprika) are iron-rich. Most dietary iron is Fe3+, which is reduced by low gastric pH and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to better-absorbed Fe2+. Absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, though very small amounts are absorbed in the stomach and ileum. Iron requirements are greater for women (menstrual loss), when growing, in pregnancy, and in chronic infection.

Hepcidin, a peptide synthesized in hepatocytes, secreted in plasma, is a negative regulator of gut iron absorption and haeme iron recycling by macrophages. Hepcidin synthesis is stimulated by iron and repressed by iron deficiency and by marrow erythropoiesis (eg in anaemia, bleeding, haemolysis, dyserythropoiesis, or erythropoietin injections). Defects in the normal triggering of hepcidin by iron excess is a rare cause of haemochromatosis unrelated to HFE mutations, whereas a defect in hepcidin repression is responsible for an iron refractory iron deficiency anaemia.

In HH, the total body iron is up to 10-fold that of a normal person, with loading found particularly in the liver and pancreas (x100). Hepatic disease classically starts with fibrosis, progressing to cirrhosis as a late feature.
