# Alzheimer's disease (AD)

This leading cause of dementia is *the* big neuropsychiatric disorder of our times, dominating the care of the elderly and the lives of their families who give up work, friends, and ways of life to support relatives through the long final years as they exit into their 'worlds of preoccupied emptiness'. Suspect AD in adults >40yrs with persistent,¹² progressive, and global cognitive impairment: visuo-spatial skill, memory, verbal abilities, and executive function (planning) are all affected, unlike other dementias which may affect certain domains but not others (identify which with neuropsychometric tests). There is also anosognosia—a lack of insight into the problems engendered by the disease, eg missed appointments, misunderstood conversations or plots of films, and mishandling of money. Later there may be irritability; mood disturbance (depression or euphoria); behavioural change (eg aggression, wandering, disinhibition); psychosis (hallucinations or delusions); agnosia (may not recognize self in the mirror). There is no standard natural history. Cognitive impairment is progressive, but non-cognitive symptoms may come and go over months. Eventually many patients become sedentary, taking little interest in anything.

## Cause
Environmental and genetic factors both play a role. Accumulation of β-amyloid peptide, a degradation product of amyloid precursor protein, results in progressive neuronal damage, neurofibrillary tangles, numbers of amyloid plaques, and loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (fig 10.24). Neuronal loss is selective— the hippocampus, amygdala, temporal neocortex, and subcortical nuclei are most vulnerable. Vascular effects are also important—95% of AD patients show evidence of vascular dementia.

## Risk factors
1st-degree relative with AD; Down's syndrome (in which AD is inevitable, often <40yrs); homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele (see BOX 'Genetics and the future'); PICALM, CL1 & CLU variants; vascular risk factors (↑BP, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, ↑homocysteine, AF); ↓physical/cognitive activity; depression; loneliness (↑risk × 2; simply living alone is not a risk factor); smoking.

## Management
- See p486 for a general approach to management in dementia.
- Refer to a specialist memory service.
- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (see BOX 'Pharmacological treatment').
- BP control (in heart failure there is a 2x ↑risk of AD; extra risk halves with BP control).

## Prevention in the context of AD's time-course:
Changes in CSF β-amyloid are seen ~25yrs before onset of unequivocal symptoms (USy) and its deposition is detected 15yrs before USy. CSF tau protein and brain atrophy are also detected 15yrs before USy. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory occur 10yrs before USy. Global cognitive impairment occurs 5yrs before USy. Prevention will probably be most effective before any of this starts—though there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any specific interventions (BOX 'Genetics and the future'). Ultimately, there is no simple relationship between brain structure, neurofibrillary tangles, and function.

## Prognosis
Mean survival = 7yrs from USy.
