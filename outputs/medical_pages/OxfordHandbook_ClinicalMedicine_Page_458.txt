Fig 10.1 The image shows a runner crossing the finish line of a race, wearing number 41. The caption describes this as the first sub-4 minute mile run on 6 May 1954. The runner, aged 25 at the time, was a medical student at Oxford University who later became a prominent academic neurologist. His research focused on the autonomic nervous system. The caption includes a quote from the runner about his childhood experiences running on the beach, describing the intense sensations and excitement it created. The caption concludes by noting that in 2014, the runner spoke publicly about being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
