Enterococci:
Gut commensal. Resistance to cephalosporins and quinolones leads to nosocomial colonization and infection. Most common is Enterococcus faecalis: if found in blood culture, assume endocarditis until proven otherwise. Treatment: intrinsic and acquired resistance including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Seek expert help.

## Gram-positive bacilli

### Listeria:
Caused by Listeria monocytogenes which lives in soil. Able to multiply at low temperatures. Found in pâté, raw vegetables/salad, unpasteurized milk/cheese. Presentation: most asymptomatic, or mild flu-like illness. In immunosuppressed (including elderly): gastroenteritis, local infection (abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, endocarditis, pneumonia), meningoencephalitis, life-threatening septicaemia. Listeria in pregnancy may cause mild disease in mother but transplacental infection→placentitis, amnionitis, preterm delivery, neonatal sepsis, intrauterine death. Diagnosis: culture: blood, placenta, amniotic fluid, CSF. PCR. Serology is non-specific. Treatment: ampicillin plus gentamicin (synergistic action) for systemic disease. Also co-trimoxazole (CNS disease), macrolides, tetracycline, rifampicin, vancomycin, carbapenem. Resistant to cephalosporins which are often 1st-line empirical treatment for meningitis so remember additional antimicrobial cover if listeria is a possibility.

### Clostridia:
- Clostridium difficile, see p259, p411.
- Clostridium perfringens:
  - Gastroenteritis, see p430.
  - Gas gangrene due to exotoxin production (alpha toxin most common). Previously Clostridium welchii. Presentation: sudden, severe pain due to myonecrosis, tissue crepitus, systemic shock. Most post surgery (GI, biliary), or following soft-tissue trauma/open fracture. If spontaneous, look for malignancy. Treatment: early recognition, surgical debridement, protein synthesis inhibitors, eg clindamycin inhibit toxins >penicillins. Hyperbaric O₂ unproven in trials (fig 9.4, table 9.7).
- Clostridium botulinum, see p436.
- Clostridium tetani, see p436.

### Diphtheria:
Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin. Preventable with vaccine. Presentation: tonsillar pseudomembrane with fever, painful dysphagia, cervical lymphadenopathy (see OHCS p158). Diagnosis: culture, toxin detection, PCR. Treatment: antitoxin within 48h. Benzylpenicillin/erythromycin. Airway support.

### Actinomycosis:
Due to Actinomyces israelii, a mucous membrane commensal. Presentation: subacute granulomatous/suppurative infection adjacent to mucous membrane. Diagnosis: culture. 'Sulphur' granules in pus/tissue are pathognomonic. Treatment: antibiotics covering actinomycetes and concomitant microbes.

### Nocardia:
Rare cause of disease. Presentation: tropical skin abscess, lung/brain abscess, disseminated infection if immunosuppressed. Treatment: usually co-trimoxazole.

### Anthrax: 
See p424.

Fig 9.5 Streptococci are grouped by haemolytic pattern (α, β, or non-haemolytic), by Lancefield antigen (A–G), or by species. The image shows a scientist using a hand lens, typing streptococci with a variety of M protein-specific antibodies. The caption mentions that her lab became known as the 'Scotland Yard of Streptococcal Mysteries' after she found that the most grievous crimes of streptococci almost always involve M as a secret accomplice. Although she arrested M on many occasions, M outlived her, and still stalks our wards and clinics.
