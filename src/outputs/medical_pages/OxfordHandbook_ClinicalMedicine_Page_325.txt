# Nephritic glomerulonephritis

Nephritic glomerulonephritides include:

## IgA nephropathy
Commonest primary GN in high-income countries
**Presentation:** Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria, or episodic visible haematuria which may be 'synpharyngitic': within 12-72h of infection. ↑BP. Proteinuria usually <1g. Slow, indolent disease: 20-50% progress to renal failure over 30yr. Worse prognosis in ♂, ↑BP, ↑creatinine, proteinuria.
**Diagnosis:** Renal biopsy: IgA deposition in mesangium.
**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria and protect renal function. Corticosteroids and fish oil if persistent proteinuria >1g despite 3-6 months of ACE-i/ARB and GFR >50.

## Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP)
Small vessel vasculitis and systemic variant of IgA nephropathy with IgA deposition in skin/joints/gut in addition to kidney.
**Presentation:** Purpuric rash on extensor surfaces (typically on the legs, p702), flitting polyarthritis, abdominal pain (GI bleeding), and nephritis.
**Diagnosis:** Usually clinical. Confirmed with positive IF for IgA and C3 in skin. Renal biopsy is identical to IgA nephropathy.
**Treatment:** Renal disease is managed as IgA nephropathy. Steroids may be used for gut involvement.

## Post-streptococcal GN
Occurs after a throat (~2 weeks) or skin (~3-6 weeks) infection. Streptococcal antigen deposits in the glomerulus leading to immune complex formation and inflammation.
**Presentation:** Varies from haematuria to acute nephritis: haematuria, oedema, ↑BP and oliguria.
**Diagnosis:** Evidence of streptococcal infection: ↑ASOT, ↑anti-DNAse B. Also ↓C3.
**Treatment:** Supportive, antibiotics to clear the nephritogenic bacteria.

## Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease
Previously known as Goodpasture's disease. Rare. Auto-antibodies to type IV collagen which is present in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes.
**Presentation:** Renal disease (oliguria/anuria, haematuria, AKI, renal failure) and lung disease (pulmonary haemorrhage in 50-90% ∴ SOB, haemoptysis). Dialysis-dependence at presentation and crescents on biopsy predict poor prognosis.
**Diagnosis:** Anti-GBM in circulation/kidney (fig 7.11).
**Treatment:** Plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide.

## Rapidly progressive GN
Any aggressive GN, rapidly progressing to renal failure over days or weeks. Causes include small vessel/ANCA vasculitis (p314), lupus nephritis (p314), anti-GBM disease. Other GNs may 'transform' to become rapidly progressive including IgA, membranous.
**Diagnosis:** Breaks in the GBM allow an influx of inflammatory cells so that crescents are seen on renal biopsy (may be referred to as crescentic GN) (fig 7.12).
**Treatment:** Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Other treatments depend on aetiology eg plasma exchange for anti-GBM/ANCA vasculitis, possible role for monoclonal antibodies in lupus nephritis.
