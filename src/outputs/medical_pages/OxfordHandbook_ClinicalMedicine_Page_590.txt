# General post-operative complications

## Pyrexia
Mild pyrexia in the 1st 48h is often from atelectasis (needs prompt physio, not antibiotics), tissue damage/necrosis, or even from blood transfusions, but still have a low threshold for infection screen. Consider evidence for peritonism, chest, urinary, wound, or cannula site infections, as well as possible endocarditis, meningism, or DVT (also causes °T). Send blood for FBC, U&E, CRP, and cultures (±LFT). Dipstick the urine. Consider MSU, CXR, and abdominal ultrasound/CT depending on clinical findings.

## Confusion
May manifest as agitation, disorientation, and attempts to leave hospital, especially at night. Gently reassure the patient in well-lit surroundings. See p484 for a full work-up. Common causes are:
- hypoxia (pneumonia, atelectasis, LVF, PE)
- drugs (opiates, sedatives, and many others)
- urinary retention
- MI or stroke
- infection (see earlier)
- alcohol withdrawal (p280)
- liver/renal failure.

Occasionally, sedation is necessary to examine the patient; consider lorazepam 1mg PO/IM (antidote: flumazenil) or haloperidol 0.5-2mg IM. Reassure relatives that post-op confusion is common (seen in up to 40%) and reversible.

## Dyspnoea or hypoxia
Any previous lung disease? Sit patient up and give O2, monitor peripheral O2 sats by pulse oximetry (p162). Examine for evidence of: •pneumonia, pulmonary collapse, or aspiration •LVF (MI; fluid overload) •pulmonary embolism (p190) •pneumothorax (p190; due to CVP line, intercostal block, or mechanical ventilation). Tests: FBC; ABG; CXR; ECG. Manage according to findings.

## ↓BP
If severe, tilt bed head-down and give O2. Check pulse and BP yourself; compare it with pre-op values. Post-op ↓BP is often from hypovolaemia resulting from inadequate fluid input, so check fluid chart and replace losses. Monitor urine output (may need catheterization). A CVP line can help monitor fluid resuscitation (normal is 0-5cmH2O relative to sternal angle). Hypovolaemia may also be caused by haemorrhage so review wounds, drains, and abdomen. If unstable, return to theatre for haemostasis. Beware cardiogenic and neurogenic causes and look for evidence of MI or PE. Consider sepsis and anaphylaxis. Management: p790.

## ↑BP
May be from pain, urinary retention, idiopathic hypertension (eg missed medication), or inotropic drugs. Oral cardiac medications (including antihypertensives) should be continued throughout the perioperative period even if NBM. Treat the cause, consider increasing the regular medication, or if not absorbing orally try 50mg labetalol IV over 1min (see p140).

## Urine output (oliguria)
Aim for output of >30mL/h in adults (or >0.5mL/kg/h). Anuria may reflect a blocked or malsited catheter (see p763) rather than AKI. Flush or replace catheter. Oliguria is usually due to too little replacement of lost fluid. Treat by increasing fluid input. Acute kidney injury may follow shock, drugs, transfusion, pancreatitis, or trauma (see p300 for classification and management of AKI).
- Review fluid chart and examine for signs of volume depletion.
- Urinary retention is also common, so examine for a palpable bladder.
- Establish normovolaemia (a CVP line may help); you may need 1L/h IVI for 2-3h. A 'fluid challenge' of 250-500mL over 30min may also help.
- Catheterize bladder (for accurate monitoring)—see p762; check U&E.
- If intrinsic renal failure is suspected, stop nephrotoxic drugs (eg NSAIDs, ACE-i) and refer to a nephrologist early.

## Nausea/vomiting
Any mechanical obstruction, ileus, or emetic drugs (opiates, digoxin, anaesthetics)? Consider AXR, NGT, and an anti-emetic (not metoclopramide because of its prokinetic property). See p251 for choice of anti-emetics.

## ↓Na+
Pre-op level? Excess IV fluids may exacerbate the situation. Correct slowly (p672). SIADH (p673) can be precipitated by pain, nausea, opioids, and chest infection.
