## Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding

### Causes
- Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) 35-50%.
- Gastroduodenal erosions 8-15%.
- Oesophagitis 5-15%.
- Mallory-Weiss tear 15%.
- Varices 5-10%.
- Other: upper GI malignancy, vascular malformations. Consider also facial trauma, nose bleed, or haemoptysis as causes of swallowed blood.

### Signs and symptoms 
(See pp56-63.) Haematemesis, or melaena, dizziness (especially postural), fainting, abdominal pain, dysphagia? Hypotension (in young may be postural only), tachycardia (not if on β-blocker), JVP, urine output, cool and clammy, signs of chronic liver disease (p276), eg telangiectasia, purpura, jaundice. NB: ask about previous GI problems, drug use, alcohol.

### Management 
Focus on circulation, see fig 19.17. Risk stratify based upon, eg Rockall score (see table 6.6, p257).

#### Is the patient shocked?
- Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refill time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h.
- ↓GCS or encephalopathy (p275).
- Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm).
- Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg.

If shocked: See fig 19.17 for management.

#### If haemodynamically stable:
- Insert two large-bore (14-16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting, and group & save.
- Give IV fluids (p821) to restore intravascular volume; avoid saline if cirrhotic/ varices; consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fluid replacement.
- Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.
- Consider a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.
- Transfuse if significant Hb drop (<70g/L).
- Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).
- If suspicion of varices (eg known history of liver disease or alcohol excess) then give terlipressin IV (1-2mg/6h for ≤3d) and initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam IV 4.5g/8h).
- Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH₂0) at least hourly until stable.
- Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).
- If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/embolization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by someone with experience.

### Acute drug therapy: 
There is no role for routine administration of PPI pre-endoscopy (provided endoscopy can be arranged in a timely manner). In patients undergoing successful endoscopic haemostasis, give PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO). Treat if positive for H.pylori (p253).

### Rebleeds 
Serious event: 40% of patients who rebleed will die. If 'at risk' maintain a high index of suspicion. If a rebleed occurs, check vital signs every 15min and call senior cover for repeat endoscopy and/or surgical intervention.

#### Signs of a rebleed:
- Rising pulse rate.
- Falling JVP ± decreasing hourly urine output.
- Haematemesis or 'fresh' melaena (NB: it is normal to pass decreasing amounts of melaena for 24h post-haemostasis, as blood makes its way through the GI tract).
- Fall in BP (a late and sinister finding) and decreased conscious level.
