# AKI

## NEWS (see p892, fig A1)
Consider critical care referral

### Is there a life-threatening complication?

- Pulmonary oedema? Early referral to renal as may need dialysis (see below)
- Urgent K+ (venous blood gas)
  Treat if >6.5mmol/L or any ECG changes (p301)

### Examine
Heart rate, BP, JVP, capillary refill, palpate for bladder

#### Treat hypovolaemia
Bolus fluid 250-500mL (p300) until volume replete
If 2L given without response, seek expert help (renal/HDU/ITU)

### Monitor
- Fluid balance—consider urinary catheter and hourly urine output
- K+—check response to treatment and at least daily until creatinine falls
- Observations—minimum every 4 hours
- Lactate if signs of sepsis
- Daily creatinine until ↓ (lags ~24 hours behind clinical response)

### Investigate
- Urine dipstick (pre-catheter) and quantification of any proteinuria. Haematuria/proteinuria may suggest intrinsic renal disease
- USS within 24 hours (unless cause obvious or AKI improving). Small kidneys (<9cm) suggest CKD. Asymmetry may suggest renal vascular disease
- Check liver function (hepatorenal)
- Check platelets—if low need blood film to check for haemolysis (HUS/TTP)
- Investigate for intrinsic renal disease if indicated: immunoglobulins, paraprotein, complement, autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM)

### Support
- Treat sepsis (p792)
- Stop nephrotoxic medication—NSAIDs, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides
- Stop drugs that may ↑complications: diuretics (especially K+-sparing), metformin, antihypertensives
- Check all drug dosages are appropriate for renal impairment
- Consider gastroprotection (H2 antagonist, PPI) and nutritional support
- Avoid radiological contrast (or ↓risk: p319).

## Referring to the renal team
Request that advice/review is necessary due to:
- AKI not responding to treatment
- AKI with complications: ↑K+, acidosis, fluid overload
- stage 3 AKI (table 7.3)
- AKI with difficult fluid balance (eg hypoalbuminaemia, heart failure, pregnancy)
- AKI due to possible intrinsic renal disease (table 7.4)
- AKI with hypertension.

Know: Creatinine trend and pre-morbid result if available, K+, bicarbonate/lactate, Hb, platelet count (+film), urine dipstick (before catheter), clinical observations (NEWS) since admission, fluid input/output, examination findings (hypo/hypervolaemia), USS result, comorbidity (eg DM), drugs given (what? when? nephrotoxic?).
