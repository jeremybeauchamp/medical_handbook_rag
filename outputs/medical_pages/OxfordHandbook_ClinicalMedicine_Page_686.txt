## Hypernatraemia

**Signs and symptoms** Lethargy, thirst, weakness, irritability, confusion, coma, and fits, along with signs of dehydration (p666). Laboratory features: ↑Na+, ↑PCV, ↑alb, ↑urea.

**Causes**
Usually due to water loss in excess of Na+ loss:
- Fluid loss without water replacement (eg diarrhoea, vomit, burns).
- Diabetes insipidus (p240). Suspect if large urine volume. This may follow head injury, or CNS surgery, especially pituitary.
- Osmotic diuresis (for diabetic coma, see p832).
- Primary aldosteronism: rarely severe, suspect if ↑BP, ↓K+, alkalosis (↑HCO3-).
- Iatrogenic: incorrect IV fluid replacement (excessive saline).

**Management** Give water orally if possible. If not, give glucose 5% IV slowly (1L/6h) guided by urine output and plasma Na+. Use 0.9% saline IV if hypovolaemic, since this causes less marked fluid shifts and is hypotonic in a hypertonic patient. Avoid hypertonic solutions.

## Hyponatraemia

Plasma Na+ concentration depends on the amount of both Na+ and water in the plasma. Hyponatraemia therefore does not necessarily imply Na+ depletion. Assessing fluid status is the key to diagnosis (see fig 14.3).

**Signs and symptoms** Look for anorexia, nausea, and malaise initially, followed by headache, irritability, confusion, weakness, ↓GCS, and seizures, depending on the severity and rate of change in serum Na+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indicate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls in the elderly.³

**Causes** See fig 14.3. Artefactual causes include: •blood sample was from a drip arm •high serum lipid/protein content causing ↑serum volume, with ↓Na+ concentration but normal plasma osmolality •if hyperglycaemic (≥20mmol/L) add ~4.3mmol/L to plasma Na+ for every 10mmol/L rise in glucose above normal.

**Iatrogenic hyponatraemia** If 5% glucose is infused continuously without adding 0.9% saline, the glucose is quickly used, rendering the fluid hypotonic and causing hyponatraemia, esp. in those on thiazide diuretics, women (esp. pre-menopausal), and those undergoing physiological stress (eg post-operative, septic). In some patients, only marginally low plasma Na+ levels cause serious effects (eg ~128mmol/L)—don't attribute odd CNS signs to non-existent strokes/TIAs if ↓Na+.

**Management**
- Correct the underlying cause; never base treatment on Na+ concentration alone. The presence of symptoms, the chronicity of the hyponatraemia, and state of hydration are all important. Replace Na+ and water at the same rate they were lost.
- Asymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia, fluid restriction is often sufficient if asymptomatic, although demeclocycline (ADH antagonist) may be required. If hypervolaemic (cirrhosis, CCF), treat the underlying disorder first.
- Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, or if dehydrated, cautious rehydration with 0.9% saline may be given, but do not correct changes rapidly as central pontine myelinolysis² may result. Maximum rise in serum Na+ 15mmol/L per day if chronic, or 1mmol/L per hour if acute. Consider using furosemide when not hypovolaemic to avoid fluid overload.
- Vasopressor receptor antagonists ('vaptans', eg tolvaptan) promote water excretion without loss of electrolytes, and appear to be effective in treating hypervolaemic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia but are expensive.⁴
- In emergency: (Seizures, coma) seek expert help. Consider hypertonic saline (eg 1.8% saline) at 70mmol Na+/h ± furosemide. Aim for a gradual increase in plasma Na+ to ≈125mmol/L. Beware heart failure and central pontine myelinolysis.²

² Central pontine myelinolysis: irreversible and often fatal pontine demyelination seen in malnourished alcoholics or rapid correction of ↑Na+. There is subacute onset of lethargy, confusion, pseudobulbar palsy, para- or quadriparesis, 'locked-in' syndrome, or coma.
