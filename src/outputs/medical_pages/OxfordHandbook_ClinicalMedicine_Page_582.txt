# 568 Consent

In which of the following situations would you seek 'informed written consent' from a patient? 1 Feeling for a pulse. 2 Taking blood. 3 Inserting a central line. 4 Removing a section of small bowel during a laparotomy for division of adhesions. 5 Orchidectomy after a failed operation for testicular torsion.

English law states that any intervention or treatment needs consent—ie all of the above—yet, for different reasons. In fact, written consent itself is not required by law, but it does constitute 'good medical practice' in the best interests of the patient and practitioner. Sometimes actions and words can imply valid consent, eg by simply entering into conversation or holding out an arm. If the consequences are not clear and the patient has capacity to give consent, you should seek informed written consent as a record of your conversation.

## For consent to be valid

- It can be given any time before the intervention/treatment is initiated. Earlier is better as this will give the patient time to think about the risks, benefits, and alternatives—he or she may even bring forward questions on issues that you had not considered relevant. Think of consent as an ongoing process throughout the patient's time with you, not just the moment of signing the form.

- The proposed treatment or test must be clearly understood by the patient, taking into account the benefits, risks (including complication rates if known), additional procedures, alternative courses of action, and their consequences.

- It must be given voluntarily. This can be difficult to evaluate—eg when live organ donation is being considered—see BOX 'Special circumstances for consent' for other difficult situations.

- The doctor providing treatment or undertaking the test needs to ensure that the patient has given valid consent. The act of seeking consent is ultimately the responsibility of the doctor looking after the patient, though the task may be delegated to another health professional, as long as they are suitably trained and qualified.

## Capacity

Capacity relates to the ability to 1 understand, 2 retain, and 3 weigh up relevant information and 4 communicate the decision. Capacity is not a fixed state, but is specific to any given time and decision—a person may lack capacity to be involved in a particular complex decision but retain capacity to decide other aspects of their care, or recover capacity as they recover from acute illness. Therefore, do not label anyone as unable to make a decision unless you have taken all practicable steps to help them to do so without success—non-urgent decisions should always be deferred if there is a chance to recover capacity. When acting on behalf of a person who lacks capacity, do so in their best interests and involve family members or an appointed surrogate where clinical urgency allows.

## When taking consent

- Does the patient currently have capacity for the decision in question?
- Are you the right person to be obtaining consent?*
- Use words the patient understands and avoid jargon and abbreviations.
- Ensure that they believe your facts and can retain 'pros' and 'cons' long enough to inform their decision. Fact sheets/diagrams for individual operations help.
- Make sure their choice is free from pressure from others, and explain that they can withdraw consent at any time after the form is signed. Some patients may view the consent form as a contract from which they cannot renege.
- If the patient is illiterate, a witnessed mark does endorse valid consent. Similarly, if the patient is willing but physically unable to sign the consent form, then a witnessed entry into the medical notes stating so is valid.
- Remember to discuss further procedures that may become necessary during the proposed treatment. This avoids waking up to a nasty surprise (eg a missing testicle as in scenario 5 earlier in this topic).
