# The breast: history

See table 2.12 for direct questions to ask regarding presenting symptoms.

## Table 2.12 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask

| Presenting symptoms | Direct questions |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Breast lump | Previous lumps? Family history? Pain? Nipple discharge? Nipple inversion? Skin changes? Change in size related to menstrual cycle? Number of pregnancies? First/last/latest period? Postnatal? Breast feeding? Drugs (eg HRT)? Consider metastatic disease (weight loss, breathlessness, back pain, abdominal mass?) |
| Breast pain (see BOX 'Breast pain') | SOCRATES (p36). Bilateral/unilateral? Rule out cardiac chest pain (p94 & p784). History of trauma? Any mass? Related to menstrual cycle? |
| Nipple discharge (see BOX 'Nipple discharge') | Amount? Nature (colour? consistency? any blood?) |

**Past history** Any previous lumps and/or malignancies. Previous mammograms, clinical examinations of the breast, USS, fine-needle aspirate (FNA)/core biopsies.

**Drug history** Ask specifically about HRT and the Pill.

**Family history** See p520.

**Social history** Try to gain an impression of support network if suspect malignancy.

## Breast pain

Is it premenstrual (cyclical mastalgia, OHCS p254)? Breast cancer (refer, eg, for mammography if needed)? If non-malignant and non-cyclical, think of:
- Tietze's syndrome (costochondritis plus swelling of the costal cartilage)
- Bornholm disease/Devil's grip (Coxsackie B virus, causing chest and abdominal pain, which may be mistaken for cardiac pain or an acute surgical abdomen. It resolves within ~2 weeks)
- angina
- gallstones
- lung disease
- thoracic outlet syndrome
- oestrogens/HRT.

If none of the above, wearing a firm bra all day may help, as may NSAIDs.

## Nipple discharge

Causes: Duct ectasia (green/brown/red, often multiple ducts and bilateral), intraductal papilloma/adenoma/carcinoma (bloody discharge, often single duct), lactation. Management: Diagnose the cause (mammogram, ultrasound, ductogram); then treat appropriately. Cessation of smoking reduces discharge from duct ectasia. Microdochectomy/total duct excision can be considered if other measures fail, though may give no improvement in symptoms.
