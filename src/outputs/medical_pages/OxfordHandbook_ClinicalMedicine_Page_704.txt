# Hyperlipidaemia

Lipids travel in blood packaged with proteins as lipoproteins. There are four classes: chylomicrons and VLDL (mainly triglyceride), LDL (mainly cholesterol), and HDL (mainly phospholipid) (for abbreviations see footnote³). The evidence that cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is undisputed ('4S' STUDY,²¹ WOSCOPS,²² CARE STUDY,²³ HEART PROTECTION STUDY²⁴) and indeed it may even be the 'green light' that allows other risk factors to act.²⁵ Half the UK population have a serum cholesterol putting them at significant risk of CVD. HDL appears to correlate inversely with CVD.

## Who to screen for hyperlipidaemia
NB: full screening requires a fasting lipid profile.

Those at risk of hyperlipidaemia:
- Family history of hyperlipidaemia.
- Corneal arcus <50yrs old.
- Xanthomata or xanthelasmata (fig 14.13).

Those at risk of CVD:
- Known CVD.
- Family history of CVD <60yrs old.
- DM or impaired glucose tolerance.
- Hypertension.
- Smoker.
- BMI.
- Low socioeconomic or Indian Asian background.

## Types of hyperlipidaemia

Common primary hyperlipidaemia: Accounts for 70% of hyperlipidaemia. ↑LDL only.

Familial primary hyperlipidaemias: Multiple phenotypes exist (see table 14.8). Risk of ↑↑CVD, although evidence suggests protection from CVD is achieved with lower doses of statin than for common primary hyperlipidaemia.²⁶ Refer to specialist.

Secondary hyperlipidaemia: Causes include: Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, or cholestasis. ↑LDL. Treat the cause first.

Mixed hyperlipidaemia: Results in ↑ in both LDL and triglycerides. Caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure.

## Management

Identify familial or 2° hyperlipidaemias, as ℞ may differ. Give lifestyle advice; aim for BMI of 20–25; encourage a Mediterranean-style diet—↑fruit, vegetables, fish, unsaturated fats; and ↓red meat; ↑exercise. Top ℞ priority are those with known CVD (there is no need to calculate their risk: ipso facto they already have high risk). Second ℞ priority is primary prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease or type-1 diabetes, and those with a 10-yr risk of CVD >10%, irrespective of baseline lipid levels.

- 1st-line therapy: Atorvastatin 20mg PO at night, for primary prevention, and 80mg for secondary prevention and primary prevention in those with kidney disease.²⁷ Simvastatin 40mg, is an alternative. ↓cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibiting HMGCOA reductase. CI: porphyria, cholestasis, pregnancy. SE: myalgia ± myositis (stop if CK ≥10-fold; if any myalgia, check CK; risk is 1 per 100 000 treatment-years),²⁸ abdominal pain, and ↑LFTs (stop if AST ≥100U/L). Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (p689) ↑serum concentrations (200mL of grapefruit juice ↑simvastatin concentration by 300%, and atorvastatin 180%, but pravastatin is almost unchanged).Current guidelines suggest a target plasma cholesterol reduction of ≥40 % in those with CVD.

- 2nd-line therapy: Ezetimibe—a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, may be used in statin intolerance or combination with statins to achive target reduction.

- 3rd-line therapy: Alirocumab—a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 (acts to reduce hepatocyte LDL receptor expression). Very effective in reducing LDL,²⁹ but expensive and needs to be given by injection every 2 weeks. Others: fibrates, eg bezafibrate (useful in mixed hyperlipidaemias); anion exchange resins, eg colestyramine; nicotinic acid (↑HDL; ↓LDL; SE: severe flushes; aspirin 300mg ½h pre-dose helps this).

- Hypertriglyceridaemia: Responds best to fibrates, nicotinic acid, or fish oil.

Xanthomata These yellow lipid deposits may be: eruptive (itchy nodules in crops in hypertriglyceridaemia); tuberous (plaques on elbows and knees); or planar—also called palmar (orange streaks in palmar creases), 'diagnostic' of remnant hyperlipidaemia; or in tendons (p38), eyelids (xanthelasma, see fig 14.13), or cornea (arcus, p39).
