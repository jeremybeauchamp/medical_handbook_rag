# 250 Dysphagia

Dysphagia is difficulty in swallowing and should prompt urgent investigation to exclude malignancy (unless of short duration, and associated with a sore throat).

**Causes** Oral, pharyngeal, or oesophageal? Mechanical or motility related? (See BOX 'Causes of dysphagia'.)

## Five key questions to ask

1. Was there difficulty swallowing solids and liquids from the start?
   Yes: motility disorder (eg achalasia, CNS, or pharyngeal causes).
   No: Solids then liquids: suspect a stricture (benign or malignant).

2. Is it difficult to initiate a swallowing movement?
   Yes: Suspect bulbar palsy, especially if patient coughs on swallowing.

3. Is swallowing painful (odynophagia)?
   Yes: Suspect ulceration (malignancy, oesophagitis, viral infection or Candida in immunocompromised, or poor steroid inhaler technique) or spasm.

4. Is the dysphagia intermittent or is it constant and getting worse?
   Intermittent: suspect oesophageal spasm.
   Constant and worsening: suspect malignant stricture.

5. Does the neck bulge or gurgle on drinking?
   Yes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570).

**Signs** Is the patient cachectic or anaemic? Examine the mouth; feel for supraclavicular nodes (left supraclavicular node = Virchow's node—suggests intra-abdominal malignancy); look for signs of systemic disease, eg systemic sclerosis (p552), CNS disease.

**Tests** FBC (anaemia); U&E (dehydration). Upper GI endoscopy ± biopsy (fig 6.13). If suspicion of pharyngeal pouch consider contrast swallow (± ENT opinion). Video fluoroscopy may help identify neurogenic causes. Oesophageal manometry for dysmotility.

**Specific conditions** Oesophagitis: See p254. Diffuse oesophageal spasm: Causes intermittent dysphagia ± chest pain. Contrast swallow/manometry: abnormal contractions. Achalasia: Coordinated peristalsis is lost and the lower oesophageal sphincter fails to relax (due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus), causing dysphagia, regurgitation, and ↓weight. Characteristic findings on manometry or contrast swallow showing dilated tapering oesophagus. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation, or Heller's cardiomyotomy—then proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, p254). Botulinum toxin injection if a non-invasive procedure is needed (repeat every few months). Calcium channel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture: Caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal cancer: (p618.) Associations: ♂, GORD, tobacco, alcohol, Barrett's oesophagus (p695), tylosis (palmar hyperkeratosis), Plummer–Vinson syndrome (post-cricoid dysphagia, upper oesophageal web + iron-deficiency). CNS causes: Ask for help from a speech and language therapist.

# Nausea and vomiting

Consider pregnancy where appropriate! Other causes, p56.

**What's in the vomit?** Reports of 'coffee grounds' may indicate upper GI bleeding but represent one of the most over-called signs in clinical medicine — always verify yourself and look for other evidence of GI bleeding; recognizable food ≈ gastric stasis; feculent ≈ small bowel obstruction.

**Timing** Morning ≈ pregnancy or ↑ICP; 1h post food ≈ gastric stasis/gastroparesis (DM); vomiting that relieves pain ≈ peptic ulcer; preceded by loud gurgling ≈ GI obstruction.

**Tests** Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca²⁺, glucose, amylase. ABG: A metabolic (hypochloraemic) alkalosis from loss of gastric contents (pH >7.45, ↑HCO₃⁻) indicates severe vomiting. Plain AXR: If suspected bowel obstruction (p728). Upper GI endoscopy: (See p248.) If suspicion of bleed or persistent vomiting. Consider head CT in case ↑ICP.

**Treatment** Identify and treat underlying causes. Symptomatic relief: table 6.4. Be pre-emptive, eg pre-op for post-op symptoms. Try oral route first. 30% need a 2nd-line anti-emetic, so be prepared to prescribe more than one. Give IV fluids with K⁺ replacement if severely dehydrated or nil-by-mouth, and monitor electrolytes and fluid balance.
