## Physical examination

The physical examination is not so much an extension of the history, but more of the first investigation, to confirm, exclude, define, or show the progress of the provisional diagnosis as revealed in the history. Even in the emergency department where the history may be brief, eg 'trauma', the examination is to confirm a fracture, or to decide that a fracture is less likely. The examination sheds further light on the history. As you get better, your physical examination gets briefer. Establish your own routine—practice is the key.

### End of the bed
- Look at the patient—are they well or in extremis? What makes you think this? Are they in pain? If so, does it make them lie still (eg peritonitis) or writhe about (eg colic)? What is the pattern of breathing: laboured; rapid; shallow; irregular; distressed? Are they obese or cachectic? Is their behaviour appropriate? Can you detect any unusual smell, eg hepatic fetor (p274), cigarettes, alcohol?
- Also take a moment to look around the bed for other clues, eg inhalers, insulin administration kit, walking aids, etc.

### Face and body habitus
- Does the patient's appearance suggest any particular diseases, eg acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis, myxoedema, Cushing's syndrome, or hypopituitarism? See p202.
- Is there an abnormal distribution of body hair (eg bearded ♀, or hairless ♂) suggestive of endocrine disease?
- Is there anything about the patient to trigger thoughts about Paget's disease, Marfan's, myotonia, or Parkinson's syndrome? Look for rashes, eg the malar flush of mitral disease and the butterfly rash of SLE.

### Peripheral stigmata of disease
Specific signs are associated with different diseases: consider the nails (koilonychia = iron deficiency), subcutaneous nodules (rheumatoid, neurofibroma?), and look for lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal). See specific systems for features to assess for, but for all systems consider:

#### Skin colour:
- Blue/purple = cyanosis (can also be central only, p34).
- Yellow = jaundice (yellow skin can also be caused by uraemia, pernicious anaemia, carotenaemia—check the sclera: if they are also yellow it is jaundice).
- Pallor: this is non-specific; anaemia is assessed from the palmar skin creases (when spread) and conjunctivae (fig 8.3)—usually pale if Hb <80–90g/L: you cannot conclude anything from normal conjunctival colour, but if they are pale, the patient is probably anaemic.
- Hyperpigmentation: Addison's, haemochromatosis (slate-grey) and amiodarone, gold, silver, and minocycline therapy.

#### Charts:
- Temperature: varies during the day; a morning oral temperature >37.2°C or evening >37.7°C constitutes a fever.³ Rectal temperatures are generally 0.6°C above oral temperatures. Remember that temperatures are generally lower in elderly patients and therefore fevers may not be as pronounced.⁴ A core temperature <35°C indicates hypothermia; special low-reading thermometers may be required.
- Blood pressure and pulse—trends are more important than one-off values; repeat if concerned.
- Urine: check urinalysis and input/output charts if available.

### Fluid status 
When admitting an unwell patient, don't forget to assess their hydration, check skin turgor and mucous membranes, look for sunken eyes, and check capillary refill (if well perfused <2s) and JVP.
