# Jaundiced patients undergoing surgery

Avoid operating in patients with obstructive jaundice—consider prior ERCP to relieve. There is risk of bleeding, peri-operative infection, and renal failure.

**Coagulopathy** Vitamin K ↓ in obstruction (requires bile in order to be absorbed. If no history of chronic liver disease, give parenteral vitamin K (consider even if clotting is normal). FFP may be required in liver disease or active bleeding.

**Sepsis** ↑Risk due to •bacterial translocation •bacterial colonization of biliary tree •neutrophil function. If cholangitis present, give antibiotics. Antibiotic prophylaxis for ERCP not recommended unless biliary decompression fails, or there is a history of biliary disorders; liver transplantation; presence of a pancreatic pseudocyst; or neutropenia, in which case give oral ciprofloxacin or IV gentamicin (check local policy).

**Renal failure** ↑Risk post-op due to ↑intestinal absorption of endotoxin (normally limited by the detergent effect of bile). This causes ↑renal vasoconstriction and acute tubular necrosis (see p298). The use of lactulose or bile salts pre-op may help. Ensure adequate IV fluids pre- and post-operatively to maintain good urine output. Monitor urine output every 2h. Consider central line, inotropes, and furosemide if output poor despite adequate hydration. Measure and correct U&E daily.

# Surgery in those on anticoagulants

▶Inform the surgeon and anaesthetist. Risks and benefits must be individualized.

**Warfarin** Minor surgery can be undertaken without stopping (if INR <3.5 it may be safe to proceed). In major surgery, stop for 3-5d pre-op. Vitamin K ± FFP or Beriplex® may be needed for emergency reversal of INR. One elective option is conversion to heparin (stop 6h prior to surgery, and monitor APTT perioperatively). When re-warfarinizing, give LMWH until INR is therapeutic, as warfarin is initially prothrombotic.

**DOACs** Decision to stop will be based upon the patient's risk of having a thromboembolic event and bleeding risk associated with the procedure.⁴ Where procedure has no clinically important bleeding risk it can be performed just before the next DOAC dose/18-24h after last dose and dosing restarted 6h post-op. Low bleeding risk procedure, omit DOAC 24h pre-op. High bleeding risk procedure,omit DOAC 48h pre-op. ▶If renal function impaired, may require longer periods of omission pre-op.

**Antiplatelets** Decision to stop is complex and best discussed with the treating team (eg cardiologist or neurologist). Premature discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients with drug-eluting stents can lead to stent thrombosis. The bleeding effects of aspirin are reversed 5d after stopping—check local policy to see if cessation required.

# Surgery in those on steroids

Patients on steroids may not be able to mount an appropriate adrenal response to meet the stress of surgery due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Extra corticosteroid cover may be required, depending on the type of surgery. Consider cover for any patient taking >5mg/d of prednisolone (or equivalent) for more than 2 weeks or any patient who has had their long-term steroid reduced in the last 2-4 weeks. There is also potential for HPA suppression in patients taking long-term, high-dose inhaled or topical corticosteroids. A guide to supplementation follows. Patients should take their normal morning steroid dose.

• Minor procedures under local anaesthetic: No supplementation required.
• Moderate procedures: (Eg joint replacement.) Give 50mg hydrocortisone before induction and 25mg every 8h for 24h. Resume normal dose thereafter.
• Major surgery: Give 100mg hydrocortisone before induction and 50mg every 8h for 24h. After 24h, halve this dose each day until the level of maintenance.

Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency will need extra cover—discuss with an endocrinologist. The major risk with adrenal insufficiency is hypotension, so if this is encountered without an obvious cause, consider a stat dose of hydrocortisone. ▶See p836 for treatment of Addisonian crisis and BNF section 6.3 for steroid dose equivalents.
