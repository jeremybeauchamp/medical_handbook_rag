## Nodules and contractures

- Dupuytren's contracture (see fig 2.26, p60) fibrosis and contracture of palmar fascia, p698) is seen in liver disease, trauma, epilepsy, and ageing.
- Look for Heberden's (DIP) fig 2.45 and Bouchard's (PIP) 'nodes'—osteophytes (bone over-growth at a joint) seen with osteoarthritis.

## Clubbing

Fingernails (± toenails) have increased curvature in all directions and loss of the angle between nail and nail fold and feel boggy (figs 2.46, 2.47). Pathogenesis is unclear although the platelet theory was developed in 1987. Megakaryocytes are normally fragmented into platelets in the lungs, and the original theory was that any disruption to normal pulmonary circulation (inflammation, cancer, cardiac right-to-left shunting) would allow large megakaryocytes into the systemic circulation. They become lodged in the capillaries of the fingers and toes, releasing platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which lead to tissue growth, vascular permeability, and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Evidence showing platelet microthrombi in clubbed fingers, and high levels of PDGF and VEGF in patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, support the theory. This does not explain the changes in patients with unilateral clubbing, usually seen in neurological disorders.

### Causes

| Thoracic: | GI: | Cardiovascular: |
|-----------|-----|-----------------|
| - Bronchial cancer (clubbing is twice as common in women); usually not small cell cancer | - Inflammatory bowel dis-ease (especially Crohn's) | - Cyanotic congenital heart disease |
| - Chronic lung suppuration: | - Cirrhosis | - Endocarditis |
|   • Empyema, abscess | - GI lymphoma | - Atrial myxoma |
|   • Bronchiectasis | - Malabsorption, eg coeliac. | - Aneurysms |
|   • Cystic fibrosis | | - Infected grafts. |
| - Fibrosing alveolitis | Rare: | |
| - Mesothelioma | - Familial | |
| - TB. | - Thyroid acropachy (p562). | |

Unilateral clubbing:
- Hemiplegia
- Vascular lesions, eg upper-limb artery aneurysm, Takayasu's arteritis, brachial arteriovenous malformations (including iatrogenic— haemodialysis fistulas).
