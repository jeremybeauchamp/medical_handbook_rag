# 210 Complications of established diabetes

Prospective studies show that good control of hyperglycaemia is key to preventing microvascular complications in type 1 and 2 DM.10 Find out what problems are being experienced (eg glycaemic control, morale, erectile dysfunction—p230).

## Assess vascular risk 
BP control (see BOX 'Controlling blood pressure in diabetes') is crucial for preventing macrovascular disease and mortality. Refer to smoking cessation services. Check plasma lipids.

## Look for complications 
- Check injection sites for infection or lipohypertrophy (fatty change): advise on rotating sites of injection if present.
- **Vascular disease:** Chief cause of death. MI is 4-fold commoner in DM and is more likely to be 'silent'. Stroke is twice as common. Women are at high risk—DM removes the vascular advantage conferred by the female sex. Address other risk factors—diet, smoking, hypertension (p93). Suggest a statin (eg atorvastatin 20mg nocte) for all, even if no overt IHD, vascular disease, or microalbuminuria. Aspirin 75mg reduces vascular events (in context of secondary prevention). Safe to use in diabetic retinopathy.11
- **Nephropathy:** (p314.) Microalbuminuria is when urine dipstick is -ve for protein but the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UA:CR) is ≥3mg/mmol (units vary, check lab) reflecting early renal disease and ↑vascular risk. If UA:CR >3, inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system with an ACE-i or sartan, even if BP is normal, protects the kidneys. Spironolactone may also help.12 Refer if UA:CR >7 ± GFR falling by >5mL/min/1.73m2/yr.13
- **Diabetic retinopathy:** Blindness is preventable. Annual retinal screening mandatory for all patients. Refer to an ophthalmologist if pre-proliferative changes or if any uncertainty at or near the macula (the only place capable of 6/6 vision). Pre-symptomatic screening enables laser photocoagulation to be used, aimed to stop production of angiogenic factors from the ischaemic retina. Indications: maculopathy or proliferative retinopathy. See figs 5.6–5.9.
  - *Background retinopathy:* Microaneurysms (dots), haemorrhages (blots), and hard exudates (lipid deposits). Refer if near the macula, eg for intravitreal triamcinolone.
  - *Pre-proliferative retinopathy:* Cotton-wool spots (eg infarcts), haemorrhages, venous beading. These are signs of retinal ischaemia. Refer to a specialist.
  - *Proliferative retinopathy:* New vessels form. Needs urgent referral.
  - *Maculopathy:* (Hard to see in early stages.) Suspect if ↓acuity. Prompt laser, intravitreal steroids, or anti-angiogenic agents may be needed in macular oedema. Pathogenesis: Capillary endothelial change → vascular leak → microaneurysms → capillary occlusion → local hypoxia + ischaemia → new vessel formation. High retinal blood flow caused by hyperglycaemia (and ↑BP and pregnancy) triggers this, causing capillary pericyte damage. Microvascular occlusion causes cotton-wool spots (± blot haemorrhages at interfaces with perfused retina). New vessels form on the disc or ischaemic areas, proliferate, bleed, fibrose, and can detach the retina. Aspirin2 (2mg/kg/d) may be recommended by ophthalmologists; there is no evidence that it ↑ bleeding.
- **Cataracts:** May be juvenile 'snowflake' form, or 'senile'—which occur earlier in diabetic subjects. Osmotic changes in the lens induced in acute hyperglycaemia reverse with normoglycaemia (so wait before buying glasses).
- **Rubeosis iridis:** New vessels on iris: occurs late and may lead to glaucoma.
- **Metabolic complications:** p832.
- **Diabetic feet:** p212.
- **Neuropathy:** p212.

2 As DM has so many vascular events, particularly encourage statin use (p690), esp. if LDL >3mmol/L or systolic BP >140. Even consider a statin whatever the pre-treatment cholesterol; discuss with your patient.
