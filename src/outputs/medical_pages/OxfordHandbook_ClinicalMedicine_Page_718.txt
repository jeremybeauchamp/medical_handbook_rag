## Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome
A triad of port wine stain, varicose veins, and limb hypertrophy, due to vascular malformation. Usually sporadic (although AD inheritance has been reported).

*Maurice Klippel, 1858-1942; Paul Trénaunay, 1875-1938 (French physicians)*

## Korsakoff's syndrome
Hypothalamic damage & cerebral atrophy due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency (eg in alcoholics). May accompany Wernicke's encephalopathy. There is inability to acquire new memories, confabulation (invented memory, owing to retrograde amnesia), lack of insight & apathy. ℞: See Wernicke's, p714; patients rarely recover.

*Sergei Sergeievich Korsakoff, 1853-1900 (Russian neuropsychiatrist)*

## Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Histiocytosis X.)
A group of single- (73%, eg bone) or multisystem (27%) disorders, with infiltrating granulomas containing dendritic (Langerhans) cells. ♂:♀ ≈1.5:1; at-risk organs are liver, lung, spleen, marrow. Pulmonary disease presents with pneumothorax or pulmonary hypertension. CXR/CT: nodules and cysts + honeycombing in upper and middle zones. Δ: Biopsy (skin, lung). ℞: Local excision, steroids, vinblastine ± etoposide if severe. OHCS p644.

*Paul Langerhans, 1847-1888 (German pathologist)*

## Leriche's syndrome
Absent femoral pulse, claudication/wasting of the buttock, a pale cold leg, and erectile dysfunction from aorto-iliac occlusive disease, eg a saddle embolus at the aortic bifurcation. Surgery may help.

*René Leriche, 1879-1955 (French surgeon)*

## Löffler's eosinophilic endocarditis
Restrictive cardiomyopathy + eosinophilia (eg 120 × 10⁹/L). It may be an early stage of tropical endomyocardial fibrosis (and overlaps with hypereosinophilic syndrome, p330) but is distinct from eosinophilic leukaemia. Signs: Heart failure (75%) ± mitral regurgitation (49%) ± heart block. ℞: Suppress the eosinophilia (prednisolone ± hydroxycarbamide), and then treat with anti-heart failure medication.

*Wilhelm Löffler, 1887-1972 (Swiss physician)*

## Löffler's syndrome (Pulmonary eosinophilia.)
An allergic infiltration of the lungs by eosinophils. Allergens include: Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola hepatica, Strongyloides, Ankylostoma, Toxocara, Clonorchis sinensis, sulfonamides, hydralazine, and nitrofurantoin. Often symptomless with incidental CXR (diffuse fan-shaped shadows), or cough, fever, eosinophilia (in ~20%) & larval migrans (p433). ℞: Eradicate cause. Steroids (if idiopathic).

*Wilhelm Löffler, 1887-1972 (Swiss physician)*

## Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome
A pre-excitation syndrome, similar to Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW, p133), characterized by a short PR interval (<0.12sec), a normal QRS complex (as opposed to the δ-waves of WPW), and risk of supraventricular tachycardia (but not AF/flutter). The cause is not completely understood, but may be due to paranodal fibres that bypass all or part of the atrioventricular node. The patient may complain of intermittent palpitations.

*Bernard Lown, b1921 (US cardiologist); William F Ganong, 1924-2007 (US physiologist); Samuel A Levine, 1891-1966 (US cardiologist)*

## McArdle's glycogen storage disease (type V)
Absence of muscle phosphorylase enzyme with resulting inability to convert glycogen into glucose (eg R50X mutation of PYGM gene; autosomal recessive). Fatigue & crises of cramps ± hyperthermia. Rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria follow exercise. Tests: ↑CK. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic (necrosis and atrophy). ℞: Moderate aerobic exercise helps (by utilizing alternative fuel substrates). Avoid heavy exertion and statins. Sucrose pre-exercise improves performance, as does a carbohydrate-rich diet. Low-dose creatine and ramipril (only if D/D ACE phenotype) may be of minimal benefit.

*Brian McArdle, 1911-2002 (British paediatrician)*

## Mallory-Weiss tear
Persistent vomiting/retching causes haematemesis via an oesophageal mucosal tear.

*George K Mallory, 1900-1986 (US pathologist); Soma Weiss, 1898-1942 (US physician)*

## Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome
Corpus callosum demyelination and necrosis, most often secondary to chronic alcoholism. Type A is characterized by coma, stupor, and pyramidal tract features involving the entire corpus callosum. In type B, symptoms are mild and the corpus callosum is partially affected. Δ: MRI. ℞: As for Wernicke's, p714 (see BOX 'Adverse effects of alcohol on the CNS').

*Ettore Marchiafava, 1847-1935; Amico Bignami, 1862-1929 (Italian pathologists)*

## Marchiafava-Micheli syndrome (Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, PNH.)
An acquired clonal expansion of a multipotent stem cell manifesting with haemolytic anaemia (from complement-mediated intravascular haemolysis), large vessel thromboses and deficient haematopoiesis (ranging from mild to pancytopenia). See BOX, 'Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria' fig 15.8, and p338.

*Ettore Marchiafava, 1847-1935 (Italian pathologist); Ferdinando Micheli, 1872-1936 (Italian physician)*
