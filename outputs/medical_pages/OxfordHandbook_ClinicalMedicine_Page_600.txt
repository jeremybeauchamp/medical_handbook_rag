# Parenteral (intravenous) nutrition

Do not undertake parenteral feeding lightly: it has risks. Specialist advice is vital. It should only be considered if the patient is likely to become malnourished without it—this normally means that the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning (eg bowel obstruction), and is unlikely to function for at least 7d. Parenteral feeding may supplement other forms of nutrition (eg in short bowel syndrome or active Crohn's disease, when nutrition cannot be sufficiently absorbed in the gut) or it can be used alone (total parenteral nutrition—TPN). Even if there is GI disease, studies show that enteral nutrition is safer, cheaper, and at least as efficacious as parenteral nutrition in the perioperative period.^5

## Administration
Nutrition must be given via a dedicated central venous line (or peripherally inserted central catheter—PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi-lumen catheter (see figs 13.9 and 13.10).

## Requirements
There are many different regimens for parenteral feeding. Most provide 2000kCal and 10-14g nitrogen in 2-3L; this usually meets a patient's daily requirements (see table 13.6, p585). ~50% of calories are provided by fat and ~50% by carbohydrate. Regimens comprise vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and electrolytes; these will normally be included by the pharmacist.

## Complications
- **Sepsis:** (eg Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus; Candida; Pseudomonas; infective endocarditis.) Look for spiking pyrexia and examine wound at tube insertion point. Stop PN, take line and peripheral cultures and give antibiotics via the line. If central venous line-related sepsis is suspected, the safest course of action is always to remove the line. Do not attempt to salvage a line when Staph. aureus or Candida infection has been identified.
- **Thrombosis:** Central vein thrombosis may occur, resulting in pulmonary embolus or superior vena caval obstruction (p528).
- **Metabolic imbalance:** Electrolyte abnormalities—see BOX 'Refeeding syndrome'; deranged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; deficiency syndromes (table 6.9, p268); acid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production).
- **Mechanical:** Pneumothorax; embolism of IV line tip.

## Guidelines for success
- Liaise closely with line insertion team, nutrition team, and pharmacist.
- Meticulous sterility. Do not use central venous lines for uses other than nutrition. Remove the line if you suspect infection. Culture its tip.
- Review fluid balance at least twice daily, and requirements for energy and electrolytes daily.
- Check weight, fluid balance, and urine glucose daily during establishment of parenteral nutrition. Check plasma glucose, creatinine and electrolytes (including calcium and phosphate), and FBC daily until stable. Check LFT and lipid clearance three times a week until stable. Check zinc and magnesium weekly.
- Do not rush. Achieve the maintenance regimen in small steps.
- Treat underlying conditions vigorously—eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance.

^5 Enteral feeding promotes integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin translocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a systemic inflammatory response—even when the gut is not the primary source of pathology.
