# Leukaemia and the on-call junior doctor

Leukaemia divides into four main types depending on the cell line involved (table 8.7).

| Table 8.7 Principal subtypes of leukaemia |                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lymphoid                                  | Myeloid                           |
| Acute: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) | Acute: Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) |
| Chronic: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) | Chronic: Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) |

These patients (esp. AML) fall ill suddenly and deteriorate fast, eg with:
- infection
- bleeding (↑: platelets ± FFP)
- hyperviscosity (p372)

Take non-specific confusion/drowsiness or just 'I feel a bit ill today' seriously: do blood cultures, FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, glucose, and clotting. Consider CNS bleeding—CT if in doubt. With any new patient, find out the agreed aim of treatment: cure; prolonging disease-free survival; or palliation with minimal toxicity? Direct your efforts accordingly; get help if lack of clarity here.

## Neutropenic regimen 
(For when neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 10⁹/L.) Close liaison with a microbiologist and haematologist is vital. Abide by infection control procedures! Use a risk-assessment tool (eg MASCC, see BOX).

- Full barrier nursing in a side room if possible. Hand-washing is vital.
- Avoid IM injections (danger of an infected haematoma).
- Look for infection (mouth, axillae, perineum, IVI site). Take swabs.
- Check: FBC, platelets, INR, U&E, LFT, LDH, CRP. Take cultures (blood ×3—peripherally ± Hickman line; urine, sputum, stool if diarrhoea); CXR if clinically indicated.
- Wash perineum after defecation. Swab moist skin with chlorhexidine. Avoid unnecessary rectal examinations. Oral hygiene (eg hydrogen peroxide mouth washes/2h) and Candida prophylaxis are important (p246).
- Check vital signs 4-hrly. High-calorie diet; avoid foods with high risk of microbial contamination. Vases containing cut flowers pose a Pseudomonas risk.

## Use of antibiotics in neutropenia 
Treat any known infection promptly.
- If T° >38°C or T° >37.5°C on two occasions, >1h apart, or the patient is septic, start blind combination therapy according to local guidelines—eg piperacillin-tazobactam—p386 (+ vancomycin, p386, if Gram +ve organisms suspected or isolated, eg Hickman line sepsis). Continue until afebrile for 72h or 5d course, and until neutrophils >0.5×10⁹/L. If fever persists despite antibiotics, think of CMV, fungi (eg Candida; Aspergillus, p408) and central line infection.
- Consider treatment for Pneumocystis (p400, eg co-trimoxazole, though beware as this can worsen neutropenia). Remember TB.

## Other dangers 
- Tumour lysis syndrome: Results in ↑K+, ↑urate and AKI. See p529.
- Hyperviscosity: (p372). If WCC is >100 × 10⁹/L WBC thrombi may form in brain, lung, and heart (leukostasis). Avoid transfusing before lowering WCC, eg with hydroxycarbamide or leukapheresis, as viscosity rises (↑risk of leukostasis).
- DIC: The release of procoagulants into the circulation causes widespread activation of coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets and causing ↑risk of bleeding. Fibrin strands fill small vessels, haemolysing passing RBCs. Fibrinolysis is also activated. Causes: Malignancy, sepsis, trauma, obstetric events. Signs: (fig 8.44) Bruising, bleeding anywhere (eg venepuncture sites), renal failure. Tests: ↓Platelets; ↑PT; ↑APTT; ↓fibrinogen (correlates with severity); ↑fibrin degradation products (D-dimers). Film: broken RBCs (schistocytes). ℞: Treat the cause. Replace platelets if <50×10⁹/L, cryoprecipitate to replace fibrinogen, FFP to replace coagulation factors. Heparin is controversial. The use of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) has significantly reduced the risk of DIC in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (the commonest leukaemia associated with DIC).
- Preventing sepsis: Give fluoroquinolone (eg ciprofloxacin) before neutropenia gets serious. Granulocyte colony stimulators (G-CSF) can increase the production of WBCs (granulocytes) from bone marrow, but should not be given routinely in chemotherapy. Herpes, pneumocystis, and CMV prophylaxis has a role.
