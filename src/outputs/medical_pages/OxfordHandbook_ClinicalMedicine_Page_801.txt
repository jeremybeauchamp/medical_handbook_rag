Fig 19.2 Managing coma. NB: check pupils every few minutes during the early stages, particularly if trauma is the likely cause. Doing so is the quickest way to find a localizing sign (so helpful in diagnosis, but remember that false localizing signs do occur)â€”and observing changes in pupil behaviour (eg becoming fixed and dilated) is the quickest way of finding out just how bad things are.
