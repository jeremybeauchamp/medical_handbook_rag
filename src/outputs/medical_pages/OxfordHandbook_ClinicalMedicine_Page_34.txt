## Comparison measures

Comparisons between 'exposed' and 'unexposed' populations are made in terms of the risk or likelihood of an outcome. This can be appreciated by plotting a 2×2 table (table 1.5).

| Table 1.5 2×2 table analysis |           |           |       |
|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Exposure                     | Event     | No event  | Total |
| Yes                          | 70        | 20        | 90    |
| No                           | 120       | 450       | 570   |
| Total                        | 190       | 470       |       |

- **Absolute risk difference (attributable risk)** = disease frequency in exposed minus the disease frequency in unexposed. Example (table 1.5): (70/90) - (120/570) = 0.57 ∴ exposure increases risk by 57%.

- **Relative risk** = ratio of outcome in exposed population compared to unexposed. Relative risk of 1 means risk is same in both populations. Relative risk >1 means exposure increases risk. Relative risk <1 means exposure lessens risk, eg vaccination. Example (table 1.5): (70/90)÷(120/570) = 3.69 ∴ risk is 3.69 × higher with exposure.

- **Odds ratio** = ratio of the probability of an outcome occurring compared to the probability of an outcome not occurring. Example (table 1.5): (70/20)÷(120/450) = 13.13 ∴ odds of outcome are 13.13 × higher with exposure.

Relative risk is easier to interpret than odds ratio but relies on a meaningful prevalence/incidence. For the individual, absolute risk difference may be most relevant.

## P-values and confidence intervals

In a study of two groups (eg new treatment versus placebo), it is possible that there is no difference (ie new treatment has no benefit). This is the null hypothesis. A p-value measures the strength of evidence in relation to the null hypothesis:

- Low p-value: data unlikely if null hypothesis is true.
- High p-value: data likely is null hypothesis is true.

A p-value is not the probability that your results occurred by chance, and it cannot tell you how good a study is. There will be many assumptions in the statistical model. Look at the details: have confounding or bias affected the result? Do not consider p <0.05 as 'statistically significant': a small p-value just flags the data as unusual. You need to question why and decide if this is clinically important.

Confidence intervals (CI) give a guide to the effect size and direction (eg benefit/harm). They give a margin of error that indicates the amount of uncertainty in the statistical estimate.

## Assessing validity

The validity of a test which dichotomizes study participants can be assessed by examining the results from the test against a standard reference (or outcome: did the participant actually have the disease?) (see table 1.6).

**Sensitivity** TP/(TP + FN) = of those with the condition, how many test positive? A sensitive test is able to correctly identify those with the disease.

**Specificity** TN/(TN + FP) = of those who do not have the condition, how many test negative? A specific test is able to correctly identify those without a disease.

'Do they have abdominal pain?' as a test for appendicitis will have sensitivity (most cases have pain), but specificity (many patients with pain do not have appendicitis).

**Positive predictive value** (TP/(TP + FP)) indicates how likely it is that someone with a positive test result has the condition.

**Negative predictive value** (TN/(TN + FN)) indicates how likely it is that someone with a negative test result does not have the condition. When you receive a test result, you need to know how likely it is to be correct.

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Test result                              | Patient has condition     | Patient does not have condition   |
| Positive                                 | True positive (TP)        | False positive (FP)               |
| Negative                                 | False negative (FN)       | True negative (TN)                |
