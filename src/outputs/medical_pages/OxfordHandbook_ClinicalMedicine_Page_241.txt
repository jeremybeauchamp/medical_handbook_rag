**Steroid use** Advise wearing a bracelet declaring steroid use. Add 5–10mg hydrocor-
tisone to daily intake before strenuous activity/exercise. Double steroids in febrile
illness, injury, or stress. Give out syringes and in-date IM hydrocortisone, and show
how to inject 100mg IM if vomiting prevents oral intake (seek medical help; admit for
IV fluids if dehydrated).

**Follow-up** Yearly (BP, U&E); watch for autoimmune diseases (pernicious anaemia).[^4]

**Prognosis (treated)** Adrenal crises and infections do cause excess deaths: mean age
at death for men is ~65yrs (11yrs <estimated life expectancy; women lose ~3yrs).

## Exogenous steroid use

Replacement steroids are vital in those taking long-term steroids when acutely
unwell. Adrenal insufficiency may develop with deadly hypovolaemic shock, if ad-
ditional steroid is not given. See p836.

Steroid use: Warn against abruptly stopping steroids. Emphasize that prescribing
doctors/dentists/surgeons must know of steroid use: give steroid card.

### Excerpt from the notes of Miss E.L.R., 92 days before her death from undiagnosed Addison's disease. From the Coroner's Court...

"Typical day—wakes up at 11.30, still feels tired, then will have some breakfast
and usually fall asleep on the couch. The most energy req. activity in last 1 month
is—cooking herself a pasta meal. Then, totally exhausted will sleep more in pm,
then eat some dinner. Goes to bed at 11pm—latest. Not able to concentrate...Used
to weigh 45kg. Now weighs 42kg."[^24]

Placed on a page about Addison's disease, we might think there are sufficient
clues to raise the suspicion of Addison's (even though her electrolytes were not
particularly awry, and her pigmentation was barely perceptible). But change the
context to our last busy clinic. We are a little distracted. The memory of Addison's
is fading. Who among us will hear the alarm bell ring?

[^4]: Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes types 1–4: 1 Monogenic syndrome (AIRE gene on chromosome
21); signs: candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism + Addison's. 2 (Schmidt syndrome.) Adrenal insufficiency + auto
immune thyroid disease ± DM ± pleuritis/pericarditis. 3 Autoimmune thyroid disease + other autoimmune
conditions but not Addison's. 4 Autoimmune combinations not included in 1–3.
