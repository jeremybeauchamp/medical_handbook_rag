# Catheterizing bladders

Urinary tract infections are the second commonest health care-associated infection, and urinary catheters are frequently to blame. Think, does the patient really need a catheter? If so, use the smallest you can and take out as soon as possible.

**Size** (in French gauge): 12=small; 16=large; 20=very large (eg 3-way). **Material** Coated latex catheters are soft and a good short-term option ►but unsuitable in true latex allergy. Silastic (silicone) catheters may be used long term, but cost more. Silver alloy coating reduces infections. **Shape** Foley is typical (fig 18.2); coudé (elbow) catheters have an angled tip to ease around prostates but are more risky; 3-way catheters are used in clot or debris retention and have an extra lumen for irrigation fluid, attached to the irrigation set via an extra port on the distal end (fig 18.3). Get urology advice before starting irrigation. Condom catheters are often preferred by patients (less discomfort) even though they may leak and fall off.

**Catheter problems** • **Infection**: ~5% develop bacteraemia (most will have bacterial colonization, antibiotics may not be required unless systemically unwell—discuss with microbiology). A stat dose of, eg gentamicin 80mg is sometimes given pre-insertion despite a lack of evidence for benefit. Check your local policy. • **Bladder spasm**: May be painful—try reducing the water in the balloon or an anticholinergic drug, eg oxybutynin.

**Per urethram** Aseptic technique required.

**Indications** • Relieve urinary retention. • Monitor urine output in critically ill patients. • Collect uncontaminated urine for diagnosis. ► It is contraindicated in urethral injury (eg pelvic fracture) and acute prostatitis.

• Explain the procedure, and obtain verbal consent. Prepare a catheterization trolley: gloves, catheter, lidocaine jelly, cleaning solution, drape, kidney dish, gauze swabs, drainage bag, 10mL water and syringe, specimen container.

• Lie the patient supine: women with knees flexed and hips abducted with heels together. Use a gloved hand to clean urethral meatus in a pubis-to-anus direction, holding the labia apart with the other hand. With uncircumcised men, retract the foreskin to clean the glans; use a gloved hand to hold the penis still. The hand used to hold the penis or labia should not touch the catheter. Place a sterile drape with a hole in the middle to help you maintain asepsis. Remember: left hand dirty, right hand clean.

• Put sterile lidocaine 1-2% gel on the catheter tip and ≤10mL into the urethra (≤5mL if ♀). In men, lift and gently stretch the penis upwards to eliminate any urethral folds that may lead to false passage formation.

• Use steady gentle pressure to advance the catheter, rotating slightly can help it slide in. ►Never force the catheter. Tilting the penis up towards the umbilicus while inserting may help negotiate the prostate. Insert to the hilt; wait until urine emerges before inflating the balloon. Remember to check the balloon's capacity before inflation (written on the outer end). Collect a sterile specimen and attach a drainage bag. Pull the catheter back so that the balloon comes to rest at the bladder neck.

• If you are having trouble getting past the prostate, try: more lubrication, a gentle twisting motion; a larger catheter; or call the urologists, who may use a guidewire.

►Remember to reposition the foreskin in uncircumcised men after the catheter is inserted to prevent oedema of the glans and paraphimos.

**Documentation**: In the notes be sure to document the indication for catheterization, size of catheter, whether insertion was difficult or straightforward, any complications, residual volume and colour of urine. It is good practice to document that the foreskin has been replaced. Sign with your name, date, and designation.

**Suprapubic catheterization**: Sterile technique required ►Absolutely contraindicated unless there is a large bladder palpable or visible on ultrasound, because of the risk of bowel perforation. Be wary, particularly if there is a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery. Suprapubic catheter insertion is high risk and you should be trained before attempting it, speak to the urologists first.
