## Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)

Interlobular bile ducts are damaged by chronic autoimmune granulomatous³¹ inflammation causing cholestasis which may lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. 

**Cause** Unknown environmental triggers (?pollutants, xenobiotics, non-pathogenic bacteria) + genetic predisposition (eg IL12A locus) leading to loss of immune tolerance to self-mitochondrial proteins. **Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA)** are the hallmark of PBC. **Prevalence** ≈4/100 000. ♀:♂≈9:1. **Risk** ↑ if +ve family history (seen in 1–6%); many UTIs; smoking; past pregnancy; other autoimmune diseases; ↑use of nail polish/hair dye. **Typical age at presentation** ~50yrs.

**The patient** Often asymptomatic and diagnosed after incidental finding ↑ALP. Lethargy, sleepiness, and pruritus may precede jaundice by years. **Signs:** Jaundice; skin pigmentation; xanthelasma (p691); xanthomata; hepatosplenomegaly. **Complications:** Those of cirrhosis (p276); osteoporosis is common. Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) due to cholestasis and ↓bilirubin in the gut lumen results in osteomalacia and coagulopathy; HCC (p286).

**Tests** *Blood:* ↑ALP, ↑γGT, and mildly ↑AST & ALT; late disease: ↑bilirubin, ↓albumin, ↑prothrombin time. 98% are AMA M2 subtype +ve, eg in a titre of 1:40 (see earlier in topic). Other autoantibodies (p553) may occur in low titres. Immunoglobulins are ↑ (esp. IgM). TSH & cholesterol ↑ or →. *Ultrasound:* Excludes extrahepatic cholestasis. *Biopsy:* Not usually needed (unless drug-induced cholestasis or hepatic sarcoidosis need excluding); look for granulomas around bile ducts ± cirrhosis.³¹

**Treatment** *Symptomatic:* Pruritus: try colestyramine 4–8g/24h PO; naltrexone and rifampicin may also help. Diarrhoea: codeine phosphate, eg 30mg/8h PO. Osteoporosis prevention: p682. *Specific:* Fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis: vitamin A, D, and K. Consider high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)—it may improve survival and delay transplantation. SE: ↑weight. *Monitoring:* Regular LFT; ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly if cirrhotic. *Liver transplantation:* (See p277.) For end-stage disease or intractable pruritus. Histological recurrence in the graft: ~17% after 5yrs; although graft failure can occur as a result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable.

**Prognosis** Highly variable. The Mayo survival model is a validated predictor of survival that combines age, bilirubin, albumin, PT time, oedema, and need for diuretics.

## Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)

Progressive cholestasis with bile duct inflammation and strictures (figs 6.30, 6.31).

**Symptoms/signs** Pruritus ± fatigue; if advanced: ascending cholangitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic failure. **Associations:** •♂ sex. •HLA-A1; B8; DR3. •AIH (p284); >80% of Northern European patients also have IBD, usually UC; this combination is associated with ↑risk of colorectal malignancy.

**Cancers** Bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and colon cancers are more common, so do yearly colonoscopy + ultrasound; consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps.³²

**Tests** ↑ALP, then ↑bilirubin; hypergammaglobulinaemia and/or ↑IgM; AMA –ve, but ANA, SMA, and ANCA may be +ve; see BOX and p553. ERCP (fig 6.30) or MRCP (fig 6.31) reveal duct anatomy and damage. *Liver biopsy* shows a fibrous, obliterative cholangitis.

**Treatment** *Liver transplant* is the mainstay for end-stage disease; recurrence occurs in up to 30%; 5yr graft survival is >60%. Prognosis is worse for those with IBD, as 5–10% develop colorectal cancer post-transplant. *Ursodeoxycholic acid* may improve LFT but has not shown evidence of survival benefit. High doses, eg 25–30mg/kg/d, may be harmful. Colestyramine 4–8g/24h PO for pruritus (naltrexone and rifampicin may also help). Antibiotics for bacterial cholangitis.

³¹ Other causes of liver granulomas: TB, sarcoid, infections with HIV (eg toxoplasmosis, CMV, mycobacteria), PAN, SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, syphilis, isoniazid, quinidine, carbamazepine, allopurinol. Signs: PUO; ↑LFT.

³² Usually gallbladder polyps are an incidental finding on ultrasound, and they can often be left if <1cm diameter, but in PSC they are much more likely to become malignant.
