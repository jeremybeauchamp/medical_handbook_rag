648 Urinary incontinence

- Think twice before inserting a urinary catheter.
- Carry out rectal examination to exclude faecal impaction.
- Is the bladder palpable after voiding (retention with overflow)?
- Is there neurological comorbidity: eg MS; Parkinson's disease; stroke; spinal trauma?

**Incontinence in men** Enlargement of the prostate is the major cause of incontinence: urge incontinence (see later in topic) or dribbling may result from partial retention of urine. TURP (p642) & other pelvic surgery may weaken the bladder sphincter and cause incontinence. Troublesome incontinence needs specialist assessment.

**Incontinence in women** Often under-reported with delays before seeking help.
- *Functional incontinence*: Ie when physiological factors are relatively unimportant. The patient is 'caught short' and too slow in finding the toilet because of (for example) immobility, or unfamiliar surroundings.
- *Stress incontinence*: Leakage from an incompetent sphincter, eg when intra-abdominal pressure rises (eg coughing, laughing). Increasing age and obesity are risk factors. The key to diagnosis is the loss of small (but often frequent) amounts of urine when coughing etc. Examine for pelvic floor weakness/prolapse/pelvic masses. Look for cough leak on standing and with full bladder. Stress incontinence is common in pregnancy and following birth. It occurs to some degree in ~50% of post-menopausal women. In elderly women, pelvic floor weakness, eg with uterine prolapse or urethrocele (OHCS p290), is a very common association.
- *Urge incontinence/overactive bladder syndrome*: The urge to urinate is quickly followed by uncontrollable and sometimes complete emptying of the bladder as the detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home (latchkey incontinence, a conditioned reflex); cold; the sound of running water; caffeine; and obesity. ∆: urodynamic studies. Cause: detrusor overactivity (see table 13.20), eg from central inhibitory pathway malfunction or sensitization of peripheral afferent terminals in the bladder; or a bladder muscle problem. Check for organic brain damage (eg stroke; Parkinson's; dementia). Other causes: urinary infection; diabetes; diuretics; atrophic vaginitis; urethritis.

In both sexes incontinence may result from confusion or sedation. Occasionally it may be purposeful (eg preventing admission to an old people's home) or due to anger.

**Management** Effective treatment can have a huge impact on quality of life.
Check for: UTI; DM; diuretic use; faecal impaction; palpable bladder; GFR.
- *Stress incontinence*: Pelvic floor exercises are 1st line (8 contractions ≈3/d for 3 months). Intravaginal electrical stimulation may also be effective, but is not acceptable to many women. A ring pessary may help uterine prolapse, eg while awaiting surgical repair. Surgical options (eg tension-free vaginal tape) aim to stabilize the mid-urethra. Urethral bulking also available. Medical options: duloxetine 40mg/12h PO (50% have ≥50% ↓ in incontinence episodes). SE = nausea.
- *Urge incontinence*: The patient (or carer) should complete an 'incontinence' chart for 3d to define the pattern of incontinence. Examine for spinal cord and CNS signs (including cognitive test, p64); and for vaginitis (if postmenopausal). Vaginitis can be treated with topical oestrogen therapy for a limited period. Bladder training (may include pelvic floor exercises) and weight loss are important. Drugs may help reduce night-time incontinence (see BOX) but can be disappointing. Consider aids, eg absorbent pad. If ♂ consider a condom catheter.

Do urodynamic assessment (cystometry & urine flow rate measurement) before any surgical intervention to exclude detrusor overactivity or sphincter dyssynergia.
