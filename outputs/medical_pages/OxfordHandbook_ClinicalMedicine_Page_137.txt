# Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)

CABG is performed in left main stem disease; multi-vessel disease; multiple severe stenoses; patients unsuitable for angioplasty; failed angioplasty; refractory angina.

## Indications for CABG—to improve survival:
- Left main stem disease.
- Triple-vessel disease involving proximal part of the left anterior descending.

## Indications for CABG—to relieve symptoms:
- Angina unresponsive to drugs.
- Unstable angina (sometimes).
- If angioplasty is unsuccessful.

NB: when CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, eg angioplasty) are both clinically valid options, NICE recommends that the availability of new stent technology should push the decision towards PCI. In practice, patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease and normal LV function usually undergo PCI, and those with triple-vessel disease and abnormal LV function more often undergo CABG.

Compared with PCI, CABG results in longer recovery time and length of inpatient stay. Recent RCTs indicate that early procedural mortality rates and 5-year survival rates are similar after PCI and CABG. Compared with PCI, CABG probably provides more complete long-term relief of angina in patients, and less repeated revascularization.

## Procedure:
The heart is usually stopped and blood pumped artificially by a machine outside the body (cardiac bypass). Minimally invasive thoracotomies not requiring this are well described, but randomized trials are few. The patient's own saphenous vein or internal mammary artery is used as the graft. Several grafts may be placed. >50% of vein grafts close in 10yrs (low-dose aspirin helps prevent this). Internal mammary artery grafts last longer (but may cause chest-wall numbness).

## On-pump or off-pump:
Seems to make little difference.

## After CABG:
If angina persists or recurs (from poor graft run-off, distal disease, new atheroma, or graft occlusion) restart antianginal drugs, and consider angioplasty. Ensure optimal management of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia, and that smoking is addressed. Continue aspirin 75mg OD indefinitely; consider clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated. Mood, sex, and intellectual problems are common early. Rehabilitation helps:

- Exercise: walk→cycle→swim→jog.
- Drive at 1 month: no need to tell DVLA if non-HGV licences, p158.
- Return to work, eg at 3 months.
