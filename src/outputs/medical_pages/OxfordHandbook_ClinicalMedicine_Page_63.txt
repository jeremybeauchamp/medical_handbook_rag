# Haemoptysis

Blood is coughed up, eg frothy, alkaline, and bright red, often in a context of known chest disease (vomited blood is acidic and dark).

## Table 2.6 Respiratory causes of haemoptysis.

| Cause | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 Infective | TB; bronchiectasis; bronchitis; pneumonia; lung abscess; COPD; fungi (eg aspergillosis); viruses (from pneumonitis, cryoglobulinaemia, eg with hepatitis viruses, HIV-associated pneumocystosis, or MAI, p400). Helminths: paragonimiasis; hydatid (p435); schistosomiasis. |
| 2 Neoplastic | Primary or secondary. |
| 3 Vascular | Lung infarction (PE); vasculitis (ANCA-associated; RA; SLE); hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; AV malformation; capillaritis. |
| 4 Parenchymal | Diffuse interstitial fibrosis; sarcoidosis; haemosiderosis; Goodpasture's syndrome; cystic fibrosis. |
| 5 Pulmonary hypertension | Idiopathic, thromboembolic, congenital cyanotic heart disease (p156), pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis. |
| 6 Coagulopathies | Any—eg thrombocytopenia, p344; DIC; warfarin excess. |
| 7 Trauma/foreign body | Eg post-intubation, or an eroding implanted defibrillator. |
| 8 Pseudo-haemoptysis | Munchausen's (p706); aspirated haematemesis; red pigment (prodigiosin) from Serratia marcescens (Gram-negative bacteria) in sputum. |

Rare causes refuse to be classified neatly: vascular causes may have infective origins, eg hydatid cyst may count as a foreign body, and infection, and vascular if it fistulates with the aorta; ditto for infected (mycotic) aneurysm rupture, or TB aortitis. Infective causes entailing coagulopathy: dengue; leptospirosis. In monthly haemoptysis, think of lung endometriosis.

R: Haemoptysis may need treating in its own right, if massive (eg trauma, TB, hydatid cyst, cancer, AV malformation): call chest team, consider interventional radiology input (danger is drowning: lobe resection, endobronchial tamponade, or arterial embolization may be needed). Set up IVI, do CXR, blood gases, FBC, INR/APTT, crossmatch. If distressing, give prompt IV morphine, eg if inoperable malignancy.

# Dyspnoea

Subjective sensation of shortness of breath, often exacerbated by exertion.

- **Lung**—airway and interstitial disease. May be hard to separate from cardiac causes; asthma may wake patient, and cause early morning dyspnoea & wheeze.
- **Cardiac**—eg ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular failure (LVF), mitral stenosis, of any cause. LVF is associated with orthopnoea (dyspnoea worse on lying; 'How many pillows?') and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND; dyspnoea waking one up). Other features include ankle oedema, lung crepitations, and JVP.
- **Anatomical**—eg diseases of the chest wall, muscles, pleura. Ascites can cause breathlessness by splinting the diaphragm, restricting its movement.
- **Others** ►Any shocked patient may also be dyspnoeic (p790 & p607)—dyspnoea may be shock's presenting feature. Also anaemia or metabolic acidosis causing respiratory compensation, eg ketoacidosis, aspirin poisoning. Look for other clues—dyspnoea at rest unassociated with exertion, may be psychogenic: prolonged hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis. This causes a fall in ionized calcium leading to apparent hypocalcaemia. Features include peripheral and perioral paraesthesiae ± carpopedal spasm. Speed of onset helps diagnosis:

## Table 2.7 Aetiology of dyspnoea by timing of onset.

| Acute | Subacute | Chronic |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Foreign body | Asthma | COPD and chronic parenchymal diseases |
| Pneumothorax (p749, fig 16.42) | Parenchymal disease, eg alveolitis pneumonia | Non-respiratory causes, eg cardiac failure, anaemia |
| Pulmonary embolus | Effusion | |
| Acute pulmonary oedema | Psychogenic | |
