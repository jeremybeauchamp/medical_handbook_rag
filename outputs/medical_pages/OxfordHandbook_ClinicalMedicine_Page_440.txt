# Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)

Viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) is a term used for severe, multi-organ disease in which the endothelium is damaged, and homeostasis is impaired. Haemorrhage complicates the disease course and can be life-threatening. VHF classification by viral subtype is shown in table 9.22.

The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) classifies a pathogen as Group 4 (highest) when it causes severe human disease, with high risk of spread, and no effective prophylaxis or treatment. Ebola,19 Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) are all Hazard Group 4 haemorrhagic fever viruses. They are largely confined to Africa (fig 9.35), with the exception of CCHF which occurs in Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia.

## Ebola

Incubation 2-21d (usually 3-12d). Evidence for fruit bats as reservoir. Outbreaks with mortality. Largest epidemic (2014-16) due to Ebola virus (EBOV, formally Zaire ebolavirus): 28,646 cases and 11,323 deaths in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Cytokine activation→endothelial damage, oedema, coagulopathy, tissue necrosis, multi-organ failure. Transmission from index case via mucous membranes, or contact with body fluids (including burial contact), viral shedding in semen. Presentation:

- Undifferentiated (0-3d). Fever (>38°C axillary), myalgia, weakness, anorexia, headache, sore throat. May not look unwell.
- GI (4-10d). Epigastric/abdominal pain, liver tenderness, N&V, hiccups, diarrhoea, hypovolaemia.
- Late organ stage (>10d). Haemorrhagic: petechiae, ecchymoses, mucosal haemorrhage, GI bleeding, haemoptysis. Neurological: extreme weakness, confusion, agitation, bradypsychia, coma. Other: hypoglycaemia, electrolyte abnormalities, secondary infection, shock, DIC, multi-organ failure, death.
