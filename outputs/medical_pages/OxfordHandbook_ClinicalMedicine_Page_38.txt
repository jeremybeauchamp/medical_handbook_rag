Fig 2.1 William Osler (1849-1919) was a great medical educationalist who loved practical jokes. He introduced many novelties to the classroom, including, on one occasion, a gaggle of geese. We can all identify with his geese, because these birds show exceptional learning ability and resilience.

Osler did not agree with gavage, a method whereby geese (and medical students) are forcibly stuffed by funnel to fatten them for the delight of gluttons. We are too familiar with the three Rs of medical education: Ram→Remember→Regurgitate, a sequence that turns once-bright medical students into tearful wrecks. Luckily in the realm of History & Examination we can flee the library and alight at the bedside, bearing in mind another of Osler's aphorisms: 'He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.'
