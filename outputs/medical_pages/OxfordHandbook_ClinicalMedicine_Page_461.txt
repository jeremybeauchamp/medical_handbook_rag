# From findings to neuroanatomy: localizing the lesions

**Cortical lesions** may cause a particularly localized problem with hand or foot movements, with normal or even tone—but reflexes more proximally in the arm or leg will point to this being an UMN rather than LMN lesion. Sensory loss may be confined to discriminative functions, eg stereognosis and two-point discrimination (p499). **Internal capsule** (p470) and **corticospinal tract** lesions cause contralateral hemiparesis (UMN signs). There is generalized contralateral sensory loss.

A cranial nerve palsy (III–XII) contralateral to a hemiplegia implicates the **brainstem** on the side of the cranial nerve palsy. **Lateral brainstem** lesions show both dissociated and crossed sensory loss with pain and T° loss on the side of the face ipsilateral to the lesion, and contralateral arm and leg sensory loss. **Cord lesions** causing paraparesis (both legs) or quadriparesis/tetraplegia (all limbs) are suggested by finding a motor and reflex level (power is unaffected above the lesion, with LMN signs at the level of the lesion, and UMN signs below the lesion). A sensory level is the hallmark (albeit a rather unreliable one)—ie decreased sensation below the level of the lesion with normal sensation above. Hemi-cord lesions cause a Brown-Séquard picture (p696): dorsal column loss on the side of the lesion and contralateral spinothalamic loss. Dissociated sensory loss may occur, eg in cervical cord lesions—loss of fine touch and proprioception without loss of pain and temperature (or vice versa, eg syringomyelia, p516; or cord tumours). **Peripheral neuropathies**: (p502.) Most cause distal weakness, eg foot-drop; weak hand (note: although Guillain–Barré syndrome typically presents as distal weakness that ascends over time, some atypical forms of Guillain–Barré syndrome may present with proximal weakness due to nerve root involvement). Sensory loss is typically worse distally (may involve all sensory modalities or be selective, depending on nerve fibre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs with trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p503); involvement of several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg in DM or vasculitis. Sensory loss from individual nerve lesions will follow anatomical territories (dermatomes, p454), which are usually more sharply defined than those of root lesions.

## Also ask

**What is the lesion?** Are the cells diseased, dysfunctional, disconnected (after a stroke), or under- or overexcited (migraine; epilepsy)? Is there loss of a specific type of nerve cell, as in MND or subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12, p334). Arteriopaths get strokes, tropical travellers get wormy lesions.

**Why?** Is there a systemic disease causing the neurology? Eg atrial fibrillation allowing an embolus to form, which then lodges in the patient's dominant hemisphere, causing an infarct that presents with dysphasia. Do a full systems examination and always beware the irregularly irregular pulse.
