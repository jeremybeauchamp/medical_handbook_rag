# Complications of stomas

▶Liaise early with the stoma nurse, starting pre-operatively.

## Early:
- Haemorrhage at stoma site.
- Stoma ischaemia—colour progresses from dusky grey to black.
- High output (can lead to ↓K+)—consider loperamide ± codeine to thicken output.
- Obstruction secondary to adhesions (see p581).
- Stoma retraction.

## Delayed:
- Obstruction (failure at operation to close lateral space around stoma).
- Dermatitis around stoma site (worse with ileostomy).
- Stoma prolapse.
- Stomal intussusception.
- Stenosis.
- Parastomal hernia (risk increases with time). NB: prophylactic mesh insertion at the time of stoma formation reduces this risk.
- Fistulae.
- Psychological problems.

# Psychological aspects of stoma care

The physical and psychological aspects of stoma care must not be undervalued. Be alert to any vicious cycle in which a skin reaction leads to leakage and precipitates a fear of going out, or a fear of eating. This in turn may lead to poor nutrition and further skin reactions, resulting in further leakage and depression. These cycles can be circumvented by the stoma nurse, who is the expert in fitting secure, odourless devices and providing patients with a wealth of physical and psychological support, both pre and post operative (explaining what is going to happen, what the stoma will be like, and troubleshooting post-op problems). ▶Early referral prevents problems. Without input from the stoma nurse, a patient may reject their colostomy, never attend to it, and develop deep-seated psychological and psychiatric problems.
