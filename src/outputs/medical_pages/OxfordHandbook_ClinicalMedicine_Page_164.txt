# Infective endocarditis (IE)

Fever + new murmur = endocarditis until proven otherwise. Any fever lasting >1wk in those known to be at risk⁷ must prompt blood cultures.⁶¹ Acute infective endocarditis (IE) tends to occur on 'normal' valves and may present with acute heart failure ± emboli; the commonest organism is Staph. aureus. Risk factors: skin breaches (dermatitis, IV lines, wounds); renal failure; immunosuppression; DM. Mortality: 5-50% (related to age and embolic events). Endocarditis on abnormal valves tends to run a subacute course. Risk factors: aortic or mitral valve disease; tricuspid valves in IV drug users; coarctation; patent ductus arteriosus; VSD; prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on prosthetic valves may be 'early' (within 60d of surgery, usually Staph. epidermidis, poor prognosis) or 'late'.

## Causes
### Bacteria: 
Bacteraemia occurs all the time, eg when we chew (not just during dentistry or medical interventions—which is why routine prophylaxis for such procedures does not make sense).⁶¹ Strep. viridans is the commonest (usually subacute) followed by Staph. aureus, Strep. bovis (need colonoscopy ?tumour), Enterococci and Coxiella burnetii. Rarely: HACEK Gram -ve bacteria (Haemophilus-Actinobacillus-Cardiobacterium-Eikenella-Kingella); diphtheroids; Chlamydia. 

### Fungi: 
Candida; Aspergillus; Histoplasma. Usually in IV drug abusers, immunocompromised patients or those with prosthetic valves. High mortality, need surgical management. 

### Other: 
SLE (Libman-Sacks endocarditis); malignancy.

## Signs
### Septic signs: 
Fever, rigors, night sweats, malaise, weight loss, anaemia, splenomegaly, and clubbing (fig 3.46). 

### Cardiac lesions: 
Any new murmur, or a change in pre-existing murmur, should raise the suspicion of endocarditis. Vegetations may cause valve destruction and severe regurgitation, or valve obstruction. An aortic root abscess causes prolongation of the PR interval, and may lead to complete AV block. LVF is a common cause of death. 

### Immune complex deposition: 
Vasculitis (p556) may affect any vessel. Microscopic haematuria is common; glomerulonephritis and acute kidney injury may occur. Roth spots (boat-shaped retinal haemorrhage with pale centre); splinter haemorrhages (fig 3.47); Osler's nodes (painful pulp infarcts in fingers or toes). 

### Embolic phenomena: 
Emboli may cause abscesses in the relevant organ, eg brain, heart, kidney, spleen, gut (or lung if right-sided IE) or skin: termed Janeway lesions (fig 3.48; painless palmar or plantar macules), which, together with Osler's nodes, are pathognomonic.

## Diagnosis
Use the Modified Duke criteria (BOX 'Modified Duke criteria').⁶²,⁶³ 

### Blood cultures: 
Do three sets at different times from different sites at peak of fever. 85-90% are diagnosed from the 1st two sets; 10% are culture-negative. 

### Blood tests: 
Normochromic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP. Rheumatoid factor positive (an immunological phenomenon). Also check U&E, Mg²⁺, LFT. 

### Urinalysis: 
For microscopic haematuria. 

### CXR: 
Cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. 

### Regular ECGs: 
To look for heart block. 

### Echocardiogram: 
TTE (p110) may show vegetations, but only if >2mm. TOE (p110) is more sensitive, and better for visualizing mitral lesions and possible development of aortic root abscess. 

### CT: 
To look for emboli (spleen, brain, etc.).

## Treatment
Liaise early with microbiologists and cardiologists.⁶² Antibiotics: see BOX 'Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis'. Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular obstruction; repeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess; unstable infected prosthetic valve.⁶⁴

## Prognosis
50% require surgery. 20% inhospital mortality (Staphs 30%; bowel bacteria 14%; Streps 6%). 15% recurrence at 2yrs.

## Prevention
Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for those at risk of IE undergoing invasive procedures. However, if they are given antibiotics for other reasons during a procedure, the antibiotic should cover the common IE organisms.

## Recommendations
Give clear information about prevention, including:
- The importance of maintaining good oral health.
- Symptoms that may indicate IE and when to seek expert advice.
- The risks of invasive procedures, including non-medical procedures such as body piercing or tattooing.⁶⁵

⁷ Past IE or rheumatic fever; IV drug abuser; damaged or replaced valve; PPM or ICD; structural congenital heart disease (but not simple ASD, fully repaired VSD, or patent ductus); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
