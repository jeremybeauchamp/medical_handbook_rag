# Broad complex tachycardia

## Definition
ECG shows rate of >100 and QRS complexes >120ms. If no clear QRS complexes, it is VF or asystole (or problems with the ECG machine or stickers).

## Principles of management
- If the patient is unstable or you are uncertain of what to do, get help fast—the patient may be periarrest (p804).
- Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly.
- If in doubt, treat as ventricular tachycardia (VT)—the commonest cause.
- Giving AVN blocking agents to treat SVT with aberrancy when the patient is in VT can cause dangerous haemodynamic instability. Treating for VT when the patient is actually in SVT has less potential for deterioration.
- If WPW is suspected, avoid drugs that slow AV conduction—see p114.

## Differential diagnosis
- Ventricular fibrillation—chaotic, no pattern, fig 3.29.
- Ventricular tachycardia (VT), figs 3.12, 3.30.
- Torsade de pointes (polymorphic VT)—VT with varying axis (see fig 3.31), may look like VF. QT interval is a predisposing factor.
- Any cause of narrow complex tachycardias (p126) when in combination with bundle branch block or metabolic causes of broad QRS.
- Antidromic AVRT (eg WPW), p127.

## Differentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy
This may be difficult; seek expert help. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular arrhythmia), a 12-lead ECG, and the response (or lack thereof) to certain medications.

ECG findings in favour of VT:
- +ve or -ve QRS concordance in all chest leads (ie all +ve (R) or all -ve (QS)).
- QRS >160ms.
- Marked left axis deviation, or 'northwest axis' (QRS positive in aVR).
- AV dissociation (Ps independent of QRSs) or 2:1 or 3:1 Mobitz II heart block.
- Fusion beats or capture beats (figs 3.32, 3.33).
- RSR' pattern where R is taller than R'. (R' taller than R suggests RBBB.)

## Management
See page 805.

## Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics)
These are common and can be symptomatic—patients describe palpitations, a thumping sensation, or their heart 'missing a beat'. The pulse may feel irregular if there are frequent ectopics. On ECG, ventricular ectopics are broad QRS complexes; they may be single or occur in patterns:

- Bigeminy—ectopic every other beat, see fig 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the second QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value.
- Trigeminy—every third beat is an ectopic.
- Couplet—two ectopics together.
- Triplet—three ectopics together.

Occasional ventricular ectopics in otherwise healthy people are extremely common and rarely significant. Frequent ectopics (>60/hour), particularly couplets and triplets, should prompt testing for underlying cardiac conditions. Post-MI, ventricular ectopics are associated with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias. Pay attention to whether the ectopics all 'look' the same on the ECG suggesting a single focus (monomorphic) or may come from multiple foci (polymorphic). Causes and management can be different.
