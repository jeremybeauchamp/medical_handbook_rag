# Obstruction of the bowel

## Cardinal features of intestinal obstruction
- Vomiting,⁹ nausea and anorexia.
- Colic occurs early (↓ in long-standing obstruction).
- Constipation may be absolute (ie no faeces or flatus passed) in distal obstruction; less pronounced if obstruction is high.
- Abdominal distension ↑ as the obstruction progresses with active, 'tinkling' bowel sounds.

## The key decisions
1. Is it obstruction of the small or large bowel? In small bowel obstruction, vomiting occurs early, distension is less, and pain is higher in the abdomen; in large bowel obstruction, pain is more constant. The AXR plays a key role (fig 13.28 & p728).

2. Is there an ileus or mechanical obstruction? Ileus is functional obstruction from bowel motility (see BOX 'Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?' & p728). Bowel sounds are absent; pain tends to be less.

3. Is the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated? Simple: one obstructing point and no vascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg sigmoid volvulus) forming a loop of grossly distended bowel at risk of perforation. Strangulated: blood supply is compromised and the patient is iller than you would expect. There is sharper, more constant, and localized pain. Peritonism is the cardinal sign. There may be fever + ↑WCC with other signs of mesenteric ischaemia (p620).

## Causes
See table 13.12.

| Causes: small bowel | Causes: large bowel | Rarer causes |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| • Adhesions (p581)  | • Colon ca (p616)    | • Crohn's stricture |
| • Hernias (p612)    | • Constipation (p260)| • Gallstone ileus (p634) |
|                     | • Diverticular stricture | • Intussusception |
|                     | • Volvulus           | • TB (developing world) |
|                     | • Sigmoid (see BOX 'Sigmoid volvulus') | • Foreign body |
|                     | • Caecal             |              |

## Management
- General principles: Cause, site, speed of onset, and completeness of obstruction determine definitive therapy: strangulation and large bowel obstruction require surgery; ileus and incomplete small bowel obstruction can be managed conservatively, at least initially.

- Immediate action: ▶'Drip and suck'—NGT and IV fluids to rehydrate and correct electrolyte imbalance (p668). Being NBM does not give adequate rest for the bowel because it can produce up to 9L of fluid/d. Also: analgesia, blood tests (inc. amylase, FBC, U&E), AXR, erect CXR, catheterize to monitor fluid status.

- Further imaging: CT to establish the cause of obstruction (may show dilated, fluid-filled bowel and a transition zone at the site of obstruction—figs 13.29, 13.30). Oral Gastrografin® prior to CT can help identify level of obstruction and may have mild therapeutic action against mechanical obstruction. Consider investigating the cause of large bowel obstruction by colonoscopy but beware risk of perforation.

- Surgery: ▶Strangulation needs emergency surgery. Closed loop obstruction may be managed with surgery or endoscopic decompression attempted. Endoscopic stenting may be used for obstructing large bowel malignancies either in palliation or as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction (p616). Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions should rarely lead to surgery—see BOX, p581.

⁹ Fermentation of the intestinal contents in established obstruction causes 'faeculent' vomiting. True 'faecal' vomiting is found when there is a colonic fistula with the proximal gut.
