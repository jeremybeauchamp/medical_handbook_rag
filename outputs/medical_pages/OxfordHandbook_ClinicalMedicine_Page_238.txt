# Adrenal cortex and Cushing's syndrome

## Physiology
The adrenal cortex produces steroids:
1. Glucocorticoids (eg cortisol), which affect carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism.
2. Mineralocorticoids, which control sodium and potassium balance (eg aldosterone, p668).
3. Androgens, sex hormones which have weak effect until peripheral conversion to testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothalamus stimulates ACTH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates cortisol and androgen production by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is excreted as urinary free cortisol and various 17-oxogenic steroids.

## Cushing's syndrome
This is the clinical state produced by chronic glucocorticoid excess + loss of the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion (normally highest on waking). The chief cause is oral steroids. Endogenous causes are rare: 80% are due to ↑ACTH; of these a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease) is the commonest cause.

### 1 ACTH-dependent causes (↑ACTH)
- **Cushing's disease**: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (usually a microadenoma, p234). ♀:♂>1:1. Peak age: 30-50yrs. A low-dose dexamethasone test (BOX) leads to no change in plasma cortisol, but 8mg may be enough to more than halve morning cortisol (as occurs in normals).
- **Ectopic ACTH production**: Especially small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tumours, p271. Specific features: pigmentation (due to ↑↑ACTH), hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis (↑↑cortisol leads to mineralocorticoid activity), weight loss, hyperglycaemia. Classical features of Cushing's are often absent. Dexamethasone even in high doses (8mg) fails to suppress cortisol production.
- **Rarely, ectopic CRF production**: Some thyroid (medullary) and prostate cancers.

### 2 ACTH-independent causes (↓ACTH due to –ve feedback)
- **Iatrogenic**: Pharmacological doses of steroids (common).
- **Adrenal adenoma/cancer**: (May cause abdo pain ± virilization in ♀, p230.) Because the tumour is autonomous, dexamethasone in any dose won't suppress cortisol.
- **Adrenal nodular hyperplasia**: (As for adrenal adenoma, no dexamethasone suppression.)
- **Rarely**: Carney complex, p223. McCune-Albright syndrome, see OHCS p650.

## Symptoms
↑Weight; mood change (depression, lethargy, irritability, psychosis); proximal weakness; gonadal dysfunction (irregular menses; hirsutism; erectile dysfunction); acne; recurrent Achilles tendon rupture; occasionally virilization if ♀.

## Signs
Central obesity; plethoric, moon face; buffalo hump; supraclavicular fat distribution; skin & muscle atrophy; bruises; purple abdominal striae (fig 5.20); osteoporosis; ↑BP; ↑glucose; infection-prone; poor healing. Signs of the cause (eg abdo mass).

## Tests
Random plasma cortisols may mislead, as illness, time of day, and stress (eg venepuncture) influence results. Also, don't rely on imaging to localize the cause: non-functioning 'incidentalomas' occur in ~5% on adrenal CT and ~10% on pituitary MRI. MRI detects only ~70% of pituitary tumours causing Cushing's (many are too small).

## Treatment
Depends on the cause.
- **Iatrogenic**: Stop medications if possible.
- **Cushing's disease**: Selective removal of pituitary adenoma (trans-sphenoidally). Bilateral adrenalectomy if source unlocatable, or recurrence post-op (complication: Nelson's syndrome: ↑skin pigmentation due to ↑↑ACTH from an enlarging pituitary tumour, as adrenalectomy removes –ve feedback; responds to pituitary radiation).
- **Adrenal adenoma or carcinoma**: Adrenalectomy: 'cures' adenomas but rarely cures cancer. Radiotherapy & adrenolytic drugs (mitotane) follow if carcinoma.
- **Ectopic ACTH**: Surgery if tumour is located and hasn't spread. Metyrapone, ketoconazole, and fluconazole ↓cortisol secretion pre-op or if awaiting effects of radiation. Intubation + mifepristone (competes with cortisol at receptors) + etomidate (blocks cortisol synthesis) may be needed, eg in severe ACTH-associated psychosis.

## Prognosis
Untreated Cushing's has ↑vascular mortality. Treated, prognosis is good (but myopathy, obesity, menstrual irregularity, ↑BP, osteoporosis, subtle mood changes and DM often remain—so follow up carefully, and manage individually).
