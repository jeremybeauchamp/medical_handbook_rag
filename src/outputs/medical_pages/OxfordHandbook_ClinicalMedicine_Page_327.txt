# Nephrotic glomerulonephritis

Nephrotic glomerulonephritides' include:

## Minimal change disease
~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Idiopathic (most) or in association with drugs (NSAIDs, lithium) or paraneoplastic (haematological malignancy, usually Hodgkin's lymphoma). Does not cause renal failure (if progressive CKD consider missed FSGS).

**Diagnosis:** Light microscopy is normal (hence the name). Electron microscopy shows effacement of podocyte foot processes.

**Treatment:** Prednisolone 1mg/kg for 4-16 weeks. 75% of adults will respond, >50% relapse. Frequent relapses are managed with ↑ or longer-term immune suppression (cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors).

## Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
Commonest glomerulonephritis seen on renal biopsy. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary (HIV, heroin, lithium, lymphoma, any cause of kidney mass/nephrons, kidney scarring due to another glomerulonephritis). All at risk of progressive CKD and kidney failure: proteinuria worsens prognosis. Disease will recur in 30-50% of kidney transplants.

**Diagnosis:** Glomeruli have scarring of certain segments (ie focal sclerosis). May miss early disease if <10 glomeruli in biopsy sample.

**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Corticosteroids only in primary (idiopathic) disease: remission in ~25%, partial remission in up to 50%. Calcineurin inhibitors may be considered second line. Plasma exchange and rituximab have been used for recurrence in transplants.

## Membranous nephropathy
~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary to:
- malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological
- infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistosomiasis
- immunological disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's
- drugs: gold, penicillamine.

Indolent disease with spontaneous remission in ~25%.

**Diagnosis:** Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody in 70-80% of idiopathic disease. Diffusely thickened GBM due to subepithelial deposits (IgG4 dominant in idiopathic, other IgGs in secondary disease). 'Spikes' on silver stain.

**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Immunosuppression ('Ponticelli' regimen: corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide/chlorambucil) only in those at high risk of progression (proteinuria >4g without response to ACE-i/ARB for 6 months, ↑creatinine by 30% in 6-12 months but eGFR still >30). The role of targeted immunosuppression in those positive for anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies remains unknown. In secondary disease proteinuria can remit with treatment of the underlying cause.

## Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
~10% of adult nephrotic syndrome (higher in low- and middle-income countries due to infection). Divided into:
- immune-complex associated: driven by increased or abnormal immune complexes which deposit in the kidney and activate complement. An underlying cause can be found in most adult cases, eg infection, cryoglobulinaemia, monoclonal gammopathy, autoimmunity
- C3 glomerulopathy: due to a genetic or acquired defect in the alternative complement pathway, eg C3 nephritic factor. Progressive kidney dysfunction is common.

**Diagnosis:** A proliferative glomerulonephritis with electron dense deposits. Immunoglobulin deposition distinguishes immune-complex-associated disease from C3 glomerulopathy.

**Treatment:** ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Underlying cause in immune-complex disease. Trial of immunosuppression if no underlying cause found and progressive decline in renal function. Treatments to block or modify C3 activation are awaited.
