# Compliance and concordance

Compliance embodies the imbalance of power between doctor and patient: the doctor knows best and the patient's only responsibility is to comply with that monopoly of medical knowledge. Devaluing of patients and ethically dubious, the term 'compliance' has been relegated from modern prescribing practice. Concordance is now king: a prescribing agreement that incorporates the beliefs and wishes of the patient.

Only 50-70% of patients take medicines as prescribed to them. This leads to concern over wasted resources and avoidable illness. Interventions that increase concordance are promoted using the mnemonic: Educating Patients Enhances Care Received

- Explanation: discuss the benefits and risks of taking and not-taking medication. Some patients will prefer not to be treated and, if the patient has capacity and understands the risks, such a decision should be respected.
- Problems: talk through the patient's experience of their treatment—have they suffered side-effects which have prompted non-concordance?
- Expectations: discuss what they should expect from their treatment. This is important especially in the treatment of silent conditions where there is no symptomatic benefit, eg antihypertensive treatment.
- Capability: talk through the medication regimen with them and consider ways to reduce its complexity.
- Reinforcement: reproduce your discussion in written form for the patient to take home. Check how they are managing their medications when you next see them.

But remember that there is little evidence that increasing information improves concordance. And if concordance is increased solely by the 'education' of the patient then it starts to look a lot like compliance.¹¹ A truly shared agreement will not always 'comply' or 'concord' with the prescriber. The capacity of the informed individual to consent or not, means that in some cases, concordance looks more like informed divergence.

## The placebo effect

The placebo effect is a well-recognized phenomenon whereby patients improve after undergoing therapy that is believed by clinicians to have no direct effect on the pathophysiology of their disease. The nature of the therapy (pills, rituals, massages) matters less than whether the patient believes the therapy will help.

Examples of the placebo effect in modern medicine include participants in the placebo arm of a clinical trial who see dramatic improvements in their refractory illness, and patients in severe pain who assume the saline flush prior to their IV morphine is opioid and reporting relief of pain before the morphine has been administered. It is likely that much of the symptomatic relief experienced from 'active' medicines in fact results from a placebo effect.

The complementary therapy industry has many ingenious ways of utilizing the placebo effect. These can give great benefits to patients, often with minimal risk; but there remains the potential for significant harm, both financially and by dissuading patients from seeking necessary medical help.

Why evolution has given us bodies with a degree of self-healing ability in response to a belief that healing will happen, and not in response to a desire for healing, is unclear. Perhaps the belief that a solution is underway 'snoozes' the internal alarm systems that are designed to tell us there is a problem, and so improve the symptoms that result from the body's perception of harm.

Many patients who receive therapies are unaware of their intended effects, thus missing out on the narrative that may give them an expectation of improvement. Try to find time to discuss with your patients the story of how you hope treatment will address their problems.
