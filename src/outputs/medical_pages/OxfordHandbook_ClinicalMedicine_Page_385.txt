The image shows a close-up view of closed eyes with pronounced reddish-purple discoloration (purpura) around the eye area, particularly visible on the eyelids and surrounding skin. This is characteristic of periorbital purpura seen in amyloidosis.

Fig 8.75 Areas of amyloid deposition in liver and spleen in amyloidosis (isotope scan).

This figure presents a medical imaging scan, likely a nuclear medicine study. The scan shows two dark areas against a lighter background, representing increased uptake of the radiotracer in the liver (larger area on the left) and spleen (smaller area on the right). These areas of increased uptake indicate amyloid deposition in these organs.
