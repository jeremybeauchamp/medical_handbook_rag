# Clinical chemistry

The page number "681" is visible in the top right corner. The text "Clinical chemistry" appears vertically along the right edge of the page, oriented from bottom to top. There's also a small orange rectangle in the bottom right corner, which appears to be a design element or logo, but no text is legible within it at this resolution.
