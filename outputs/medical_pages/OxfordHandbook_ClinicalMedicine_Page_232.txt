# 218 Thyrotoxicosis

The clinical effect of excess thyroid hormone, usually from gland hyperfunction.

## Symptoms
Diarrhoea; ↓weight; ↑appetite (if ↑↑, paradoxical weight gain in 10%); over-active; sweats; heat intolerance; palpitations; tremor; irritability; labile emotions; oligomenorrhoea ± infertility. Rarely psychosis; chorea; panic; itch; alopecia; urticaria.

## Signs
Pulse fast/irregular (AF or SVT; VT rare); warm moist skin; fine tremor; palmar erythema; thin hair; lid lag; lid retraction (exposure of sclera above iris; causing 'stare', (fig 5.14; eyelid lags behind eye's descent as patient watches your finger descend slowly). There may be goitre (fig 5.15); thyroid nodules; or bruit depending on the cause. Signs of Graves' disease: 1 Eye disease (BOX 'Thyroid eye disease'): exophthalmos, ophthalmoplegia. 2 Pretibial myxoedema: oedematous swellings above lateral malleoli; the term myxoedema is confusing here. 3 Thyroid acropachy: extreme manifestation, with clubbing, painful finger and toe swelling, and periosteal reaction in limb bones.

## Tests
TSH (suppressed), T4, and T3. There may be mild normocytic anaemia, mild neutropenia (in Graves'), ↑ESR, ↑Ca2+, ↑LFT. Also: Check thyroid autoantibodies. Isotope scan if the cause is unclear, to detect nodular disease or subacute thyroiditis. If ophthalmopathy, test visual fields, acuity, and eye movements (see BOX 'Thyroid eye disease').

## Causes

### Graves' disease
Prevalence: 0.5% (⅔ of cases of hyperthyroidism). ♀:♂≈9:1. Typical age: 40-60yrs (younger if maternal family history). Cause: circulating IgG autoantibodies binding to and activating G-protein-coupled thyrotropin receptors, which cause smooth thyroid enlargement and ↑hormone production (esp. T3), and react with orbital autoantigens. Triggers: stress; infection; childbirth. Patients are often hyperthyroid but may be, or become, hypo- or euthyroid. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases: vitiligo, type 1 DM, Addison's (table 5.3).

### Toxic multinodular goitre
Seen in the elderly and in iodine-deficient areas.There are nodules that secrete thyroid hormones. Surgery is indicated for compressive symptoms from the enlarged thyroid (dysphagia or dyspnoea).

### Toxic adenoma
There is a solitary nodule producing T3 and T4. On isotope scan, the nodule is 'hot' (p216), and the rest of the gland is suppressed.

### Ectopic thyroid tissue
Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, or struma ovarii: ovarian teratoma with thyroid tissue.

### Exogenous
Iodine excess, eg food contamination, contrast media (→thyroid storm, p834, if already hyperthyroid). Levothyroxine excess causes ↑T4, ↑T3, ↓thyroglobulin.

### Others
1. Subacute de Quervain's thyroiditis: self-limiting post-viral with painful goitre, T° ± ↑ESR. Low isotope uptake on scan. Rx: NSAIDs. 
2. Drugs: amiodarone (p220), lithium (hypothyroidism more common). 
3. Postpartum. 
4. TB (rare).

## Treatment

1. Drugs: β-blockers (eg propranolol 40mg/6h) for rapid control of symptoms. Anti-thyroid medication: two strategies (equally effective):17 
   A. Titration, eg carbimazole 20-40mg/24h PO for 4wks, reduce according to TFTs every 1-2 months. 
   B. Block-replace: Give carbimazole + levothyroxine simultaneously (less risk of iatrogenic hypothyroidism). In Graves', maintain on either regimen for 12-18 months then withdraw. ~50% will relapse, requiring radioiodine or surgery. Carbimazole SE: agranulocytosis (↓neutrophils, can lead to dangerous sepsis; rare (0.03%)); warn to stop and get an urgent FBC if signs of infection, eg T°↑, sore throat/mouth ulcers.

2. Radioiodine (131I): Most become hypothyroid post-treatment. There is no evidence for ↑cancer, birth defects, or infertility in women. CI: pregnancy, lactation. Caution in active hyperthyroidism as risk of thyroid storm (p835).

3. Thyroidectomy (usually total): Carries a risk of damage to recurrent laryngeal nerve (hoarse voice) and hypoparathyroidism. Patients will become hypothyroid, so thyroid replacement needed.

4. In pregnancy and infancy: Get expert help. See OHCS p24 & OHCS p182.

## Complications
Heart failure (thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy, ↑ in elderly), angina, AF (seen in 10-25%: control hyperthyroidism and warfarinize if no contraindication), osteoporosis, ophthalmopathy, gynaecomastia. →Thyroid storm (p835).
