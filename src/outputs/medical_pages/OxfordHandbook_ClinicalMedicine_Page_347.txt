| Megaloblastic anaemia: peripheral blood film showing many macrocytes and one hypersegmented neutrophil (normally there should be ≤5 segments). | Oval macrocytes seen here in myelodysplastic syndromes. Note aniso- and poikilocytosis with small fragmented cells (schistocytes). NB: B12 and folate deficiencies also cause oval macrocytes, but macrocytes caused by alcohol and liver disease are usually round. |

The image shows two microscopic views of blood cells, each accompanied by a descriptive caption. The left image (Fig 8.25) displays larger, irregularly shaped red blood cells characteristic of megaloblastic anemia, along with a neutrophil with multiple segments. The right image (Fig 8.26) shows oval-shaped macrocytes and other cellular abnormalities associated with myelodysplastic syndromes.

These images are part of a medical textbook or journal, specifically focusing on hematology, as indicated by the sidebar label. The page number 333 is visible in the top right corner.
