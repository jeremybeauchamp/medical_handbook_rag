Lymphoedema may be primary, as in Milroy or Meige disease, and is a feature in both Turner and Noonan syndromes. More commonly it is secondary to other conditions, eg cancer (after surgery, lymph node dissection, radiotherapy, or from direct tumour effect), cellulitis, varicose veins, or immobility/dependency. Filariasis (p421) is a common cause in tropical regions.

## Who was Baron Münchausen?

Baron Karl Münchausen was an 18th-century German aristocrat and fabulist, whose tall tales became first a popular book, then a byword for circular logic, and finally a medical syndrome of self-delusion. He is famous for riding cannonballs, travelling to the moon, and pulling himself out of a swamp by his own hair. In emergencies (we've all had that sinking feeling...), this method may save your life, for example in your final exams (fig 15.11):

Examiner: 'What is ITP?'
You: 'ITP is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.' (you have scored 50% already).
Examiner: 'And what is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?'
You: 'It's when a cryptogenic cause of a low platelet count leads to purpura.'

You have deployed your skills with logical brilliance, without adding a single insight. For this Münchausen circularity you may be awarded 100%—unless your examiner is a philosopher, when the right answer would be 'What is ITP? I don't know—and nor do you'—but don't try this too often. You see, you must never forget that medicine is marvellously scientific, and no one is popular who dares cast doubt on this article of faith.
