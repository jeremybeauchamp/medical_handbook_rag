The image shows a mostly blank white page with the following elements:

1. The number "591" in the top right corner, likely indicating a page number.

2. A vertical red bar on the right side of the page containing the word "Surgery" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. A small red square icon in the bottom right corner containing a scissors symbol, which is likely related to the "Surgery" theme.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter title page for a section on Surgery in a larger document or textbook.
