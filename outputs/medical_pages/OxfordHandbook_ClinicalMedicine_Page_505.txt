## Seizure classification

### Focal seizures
Originating within networks linked to one hemisphere and often seen with underlying structural disease. Various subclasses include:

- **Without impairment of consciousness:** (Previously described as 'simple'.)
  Awareness is unimpaired, with focal motor, sensory (olfactory, visual, etc.), autonomic, or psychic symptoms. No post-ictal symptoms.
- **With impairment of consciousness:** (Previously described as 'complex'.) Awareness is impaired—either at seizure onset or following a simple partial aura. Most commonly arise from the temporal lobe, in which post-ictal confusion is a feature.
- **Evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure:** (Previously described as 'secondary generalized'.) In ⅔ of patients with partial seizures, the electrical disturbance, which starts focally, spreads widely, causing a generalized seizure, which is typically convulsive.

### Generalized seizures
Originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging bilaterally distributed networks leading to simultaneous onset of widespread electrical discharge with no localizing features referable to a single hemisphere. Important subtypes include:

- **Absence seizures:** Brief (≤10s) pauses, eg suddenly stops talking in mid-sentence, then carries on where left off. Presents in childhood.
- **Tonic–clonic seizures:** Loss of consciousness. Limbs stiffen (tonic), then jerk (clonic). May have one without the other. Post-ictal confusion and drowsiness.
- **Myoclonic seizures:** Sudden jerk of a limb, face, or trunk. The patient may be thrown suddenly to the ground, or have a violently disobedient limb: one patient described it as 'my flying-saucer epilepsy', as crockery which happened to be in the hand would take off.
- **Atonic (akinetic) seizures:** Sudden loss of muscle tone causing a fall, no LOC.
- **Infantile spasms:** (OHCS p206) Commonly associated with tuberous sclerosis.

NB: the classification of epileptic syndromes is separate to the classification of seizures, and is based on seizure type, age of onset, EEG findings, and other features such as family history.

## Localizing features of focal seizures

### Temporal lobe
- Automatisms—complex motor phenomena with impaired awareness, varying from primitive oral (lip smacking, chewing, swallowing) or manual movements (fumbling, fiddling, grabbing), to complex actions.
- Dysphasia.
- Déjà vu (when everything seems strangely familiar), or jamais vu (everything seems strangely unfamiliar).
- Emotional disturbance, eg sudden terror, panic, anger, or elation, and derealization (out-of-body experiences).
- Hallucinations of smell, taste, or sound.
- Delusional behaviour.
- Bizarre associations—eg 'Canned music at Tesco always makes me cry and then pass out'.

### Frontal lobe
- Motor features such as posturing or peddling movements of the legs.
- Jacksonian march (a spreading focal motor seizure with retained awareness, often starting with the face or a thumb).
- Motor arrest.
- Subtle behavioural disturbances (often diagnosed as psychogenic).
- Dysphasia or speech arrest.
- Post-ictal Todd's palsy (p712).

### Parietal lobe
- Sensory disturbances—tingling, numbness, pain (rare).
- Motor symptoms (due to spread to the pre-central gyrus).

### Occipital lobe
- Visual phenomena such as spots, lines, flashes.
