Flow rate is given as maximum flow rate under gravity; faster rates may be achievable with rapid infusion devices.
According to Poiseuille's law¹ the flow rate (Q) of a fluid through a tubular structure is inversely proportional
to viscosity (η) and length (l) and proportional to the pressure difference across it (P₁ - P₀) and the radius
to the power of 4(r⁴). Hence:

$$ Q ∝ \frac{(P_1 - P_0)r^4}{\eta l} $$

## A last throw of the dice

Just once it may come down to you. For some, this is one of the challenges and
thrills in medicine. There may be no one else available to help when there is an
absolute and urgent indication for IV drugs/fluids/blood—and all of the previously
discussed measures have been tried, and have failed. Think of lonesome night
shifts, over-run emergency departments, a disaster scene, war, or medicine in
the field. The following measures are not recommended for non-life-threatening
scenarios:

- Don't worry. Have a good look again. Feet (avoid in diabetics)? Inside of the
forearm? Upper arm?
- Have you really exhausted all of your options for help from a colleague? Maybe
the anaesthetist or ICU registrar is approachable—they do have remarkable skills.
- Is the patient familiar with his/her own veins (eg previous IV drug abuser)?
- If there is only a small amount of IV medication required and a small, short vein,
you may be able to gain access with a carefully placed butterfly needle that is
taped down. Some drugs cannot be passed this way (eg amiodarone, K⁺).
- The external jugular vein may become prominent when the patient is head down
(Trendelenburg) by 5-10° (▶ not in situations of fluid overload, LVF, ↑ICP). Only attempt cannulation of this vein if you are not going to jeopardize future central
line insertion, and if you can clearly determine the surrounding anatomy.
- In an arrest situation, the 2015 Advanced Life Support Guidelines recommend
the intraosseous route in both adults and children if venous access is not possible; access devices should be available within resuscitation settings (eg emergency department).

Only do the following if you have had the appropriate training/experience:
- In children, consider cannulating a scalp vein.
- Central venous catheterization (p775). This may be just as hard in a profoundly
hypovolaemic arrest patient, and a good knowledge of local anatomy and of the
procedure (± ultrasound guidance) will be invaluable.

If you don't have an intraosseous access device, a cut down to the long saphenous vein may be attempted, in extremis, even if you have no prior experience (at
this site you won't kill by being ham-fisted). ▶ Make a transverse incision 1-2cm
anterior and superior to the medial malleolus. ▶ Free vein with forceps. ▶ Cannulate
it under direct vision. ▶ Here, 'first do no harm' is trumped by 'nothing ventured,
nothing gained'.

Hopefully, it shouldn't ever have to come to these measures, but one day...

¹ Poiseuille's law is a neat piece of physiology and worth remembering—it is applicable in some form to
almost every system in the body. Note that it is a 4th-power law: a small change in the radius makes a huge
difference to flow.
