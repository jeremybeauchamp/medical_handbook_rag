# The first successful laparotomy...

In 1809, an American surgeon by the name of Ephraim McDowell performed an astonishing operation: the first successful elective laparotomy for an abdominal tumour. It was an ovariotomy for an ovarian mass in a 44-year-old who, prior to physical examination by McDowell, was believed to be gravid. Not only was this feat performed in the age before anaesthesia and antisepsis, but it was also performed on a table in the front room of McDowell's Kentucky home, at that time on the frontier of the West in the United States. His account of the operation makes fascinating reading. While the strength of his diagnostic convictions combined with his speed and skill at operating is to be admired (the operation took 25 minutes), there is an even more laudable part played in this story. The patient, Mrs Jane Todd-Crawford, was fully willing to be involved with what can only be described as experimental surgery in the face of uncertainty. She defied pain simply by reciting psalms and hymns, and was back at home within 4 weeks with no complications, ultimately living another 33 years. We would be well served in remembering the exceptional commitment of Mrs Todd-Crawford. In the rush and hurry of our daily tasks perhaps it is all to easy to forget that the undertaking of surgery today may be no less fear-provoking for patients than it was 200 years ago.
