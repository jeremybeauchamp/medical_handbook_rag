# 236 Hyperprolactinaemia

This is the commonest hormonal disturbance of the pituitary. It presents earlier in women (menstrual disturbance) but later in men (eg with erectile dysfunction and/or mass effects). Prolactin stimulates lactation.[11,12] Raised levels lead to hypogonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (hence LH/FSH and testosterone or oestrogen).

## Causes of raised plasma prolactin (PRL; >390mU/L)
PRL is secreted from the anterior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothalamus. Hyperprolactinaemia may result from 1 Excess production from the pituitary, eg prolactinoma. 2 Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk, reducing local dopamine levels. 3 Use of a dopamine antagonist. A PRL of 1000-5000mU/L may result from any, but >5000 is likely to be due to a prolactinoma, with macroadenomas (>10mm) having the highest levels, eg 10,000-100,000.

- **Physiological**: Pregnancy; breastfeeding; stress. Acute rises occur post-orgasm.[11]
- **Drugs (most common cause)**: Metoclopramide; haloperidol; methyldopa; oestrogens; ecstasy/MDMA;[12] antipsychotics (a reason for 'non-compliance': sustained hyperprolactinaemia may cause ↓libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction).
- **Diseases**: Prolactinoma: micro- or macroadenoma; Stalk damage: pituitary adenomas, surgery, trauma; Hypothalamic disease: craniopharyngioma, other tumours; Other: hypothyroidism (due to TRH), chronic renal failure (↓excretion).

## Symptoms
♀: Amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea; infertility; galactorrhoea (fig 5.27). Also: ↓libido, ↑weight, dry vagina. ♂: Erectile dysfunction, ↓facial hair, galactorrhoea. May present late with osteoporosis or local pressure effects from the tumour (p234).

## Tests
Basal PRL: non-stressful venepuncture between 09.00 and 16.00h. Do a pregnancy test, TFT, U&E. MRI pituitary if other causes are ruled out.

## Management
Refer to a specialist endocrinology clinic. Dopamine agonists (bromocriptine or cabergoline) are 1st line.

### Microprolactinomas:
A tumour <10mm on MRI (~25% of us have asymptomatic microprolactinomas). Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, ↓PRL secretion, restores menstrual cycles and ↓tumour size. Dose is titrated up: 1.25mg PO; increase weekly by 1.25-2.5mg/d until ~2.5mg/12h. SE: nausea, depression, postural hypotension (minimize by giving at night). If pregnancy is planned, use barrier contraception until 2 periods have occurred. If subsequent pregnancy occurs, stop bromocriptine after the 1st missed period. An alternative dopamine agonist is cabergoline: more effective and fewer SE, but there are fewer data on safety in pregnancy. NB: ergot alkaloids (bromocriptine and cabergoline) can cause fibrosis (eg echocardiograms are needed). Trans-sphenoidal surgery may be considered if intolerant of dopamine agonists. It has a high success rate, but there are risks of permanent hormone deficiency and prolactinoma recurrence, and so it is usually reserved as a 2nd-line treatment.

### Macroprolactinomas:
A tumour >10mm diameter on MRI. As they are near the optic chiasm, there may be ↓acuity, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, visual-field loss, and optic atrophy. Treat initially with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine if fertility is the goal). Surgery is rarely needed, but consider if visual symptoms or pressure effects which fail to respond to medical treatment. Bromocriptine, and in some cases radiation therapy, may be required post-op as complete surgical resection is uncommon. If pregnant, monitor closely ideally in a combined endocrine/antenatal clinic as there is risk of expansion.

## Follow-up
Monitor PRL. If headache or visual loss, check fields (? do MRI). Medication can be decreased after 2yrs, but recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia and expansion of the tumour may occur, and so these patients should be monitored carefully.

11 The prolactin increase (♂ and ♀) after coitus is ~400% greater than after masturbation; post-orgasmic prolactin is part of a feedback loop decreasing arousal by inhibiting central dopaminergic processes. The size of post-orgasmic prolactin increase is a neurohormonal index of sexual satisfaction.

12 MDMA also ↑oxytocin; prolactin + oxytocin are thought to mediate post-orgasmic well-being.
