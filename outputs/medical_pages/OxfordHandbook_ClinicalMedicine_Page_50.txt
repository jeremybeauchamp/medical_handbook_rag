# The cardiovascular system: history

## Table 2.3 Presenting symptoms and questions to ask

| Presenting symptoms | Direct questions |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Chest pain (see pp94-5 and p784) | Site? Central?<br>Onset? (Sudden? What was the patient doing?)<br>Character? Ask patient to describe pain (Crushing? Heavy?).<br>Radiation? Ask specifically if moves to arm, neck, or jaw?<br>Associations? Ask specifically about shortness of breath, nausea, sweating.<br>Timing? Duration?<br>Exacerbating and alleviating factors? Worse with respiration or movement (less likely to be angina)? Relieved by GTN? Worse on inspiration and better when sitting forwards (pericarditis)?<br>Severity: out of 10?<br>Is patient known to have angina or chest pain; better/worse/same as usual pain; is it more frequent? Decreasing exercise tolerance?<br>NB: 'heartburn' more likely if 'burning', onset after eating/drinking, worse lying flat, or associated with dysphagia. |
| Palpitations | 'Ever aware of your own heartbeat'? When and how did it start/stop? Duration? Onset sudden/gradual? Associated with blackout (how long)? Chest pain? Dyspnoea? Food related (eg caffeine)?<br>Regular fast palpitations may reflect paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT).<br>Irregular fast palpitations are likely to be paroxysmal AF, or atrial flutter with variable block.<br>Dropped or missed beats related to rest, recumbency, or eating are likely to be atrial or ventricular ectopics.<br>Regular pounding may be due to anxiety.<br>Slow palpitations are likely to be due to drugs such as β-blockers, or bigeminus (fig 3.34, p129).<br>Reassurance is vital and can be therapeutic. Check a TSH and consider a 24h ECG (Holter monitor, p125). An event recorder, if available, is better than 24h ECGs. |
| Dyspnoea (see p52, and p782) | Duration? At rest? On exertion? Determine exercise tolerance (and any other reason for limitation, eg arthritis). NYHA classification (p135)?<br>Worse when lying flat, how many pillows does the patient sleep with (orthopnoea)? Does the patient ever wake up in the night gasping for breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea), and how often? Any ankle swelling? |
| Dizziness/ blackouts (see pp460-3) | Dizziness is a loose term, so try to clarify if your patient means: did patient lose consciousness, and for how long (short duration suggests cardiac while longer duration suggests a neurological cause)? Any warning (pre-syncope)? What was patient doing at the time? Sudden/ gradual? Associated symptoms? Any residual symptoms, eg confusion? How long did it take for patient to return to 'normal'? Tongue biting (pp460-1), seizure, incontinence? Witnessed? Memory loss pre/post event?<br>Vertigo (p462), the illusion of rotation of either the patient or their surroundings ± difficulty walking/standing, patients may fall over.<br>Imbalance, a difficulty in walking straight but without vertigo, from peripheral nerve, posterior column, cerebellar, or other central pathway failure.<br>Faintness ie 'light-headedness', seen in anaemia, ↓BP, postural hypotension, hypoglycaemia, carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and epilepsy. |
| Claudication | SOCRATES? Foot/calf/thigh/buttock? 'Claudication distance', ie how long can patient walk before onset of pain? Rest pain? |
