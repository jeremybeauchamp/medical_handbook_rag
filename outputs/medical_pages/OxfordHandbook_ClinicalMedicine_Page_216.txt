Fig 5.1 Our understanding of hormones, while still evolving, originated from a mix of random experiments, coincidental findings, and extraordinary sounding characters! One of these was the 'castrati' that featured in opera throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. These were boys who were castrated before puberty. The voice of a castrato was pure and forceful, due to their enormous lung capacity and resulting breath control. They also experienced no temporal recession, and their arms and legs were long. One of the most well renowned was Farinelli, the stage name of Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi. It was said he had a well-modulated soprano voice with extraordinary breath control. His picture hangs in Handel's house in London. The practice was stopped in the early 20th century when it was acknowledged how inhumane the operation was.
