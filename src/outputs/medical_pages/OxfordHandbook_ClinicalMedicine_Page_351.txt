# Direct Coombs test / Direct antiglobulin test

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Blood sample from a patient | Blood sample from a patient with immune mediated haemolytic anaemia: antibodies are shown attached to antigens on the RBC surface. |
| 2. The patient's washed RBCs are incubated | The patient's washed RBCs are incubated with antihuman antibodies (Coombs reagent). |
| 3. Positive test result | RBCs agglutinate: antihuman antibodies form links between RBCs by binding to the human antibodies on the RBCs. |

# Indirect Coombs test / Indirect antiglobulin test

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Recipient's serum | Recipient's serum is obtained, containing antibodies (Ig's). |
| 2. Donor's blood sample | Donor's blood sample is added to the tube with serum. |
| 3. Recipient's Ig's that target | Recipient's Ig's that target the donor's red blood cells form antibody-antigen complexes. |
| 4. Anti-human Ig's | Anti-human Ig's (Coombs antibodies) are added to the solution. |
| 5. Positive test result | Agglutination of red blood cells occurs, because human Ig's are attached to red blood cells. |

## Legend

- Antigens on the red blood cells surface
- Human anti-RBC antibody
- Antihuman antibody (Coombs reagent)

Fig 8.28 The direct Coombs test detects antibodies on RBCs. The indirect Coombs test is used in pre-natal testing and before blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are free in serum: serum is incubated with RBCs of known antigenicity. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive.
