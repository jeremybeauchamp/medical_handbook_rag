## Takayasu's arteritis (Aortic arch syndrome; pulseless disease.)
Rare outside of Japan, this systemic vasculitis affects the aorta and its major branches. Granulomatous inflammation causes stenosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms. It often affects women aged 20-40yrs. Symptoms depend on the arteries involved. The aortic arch is often affected, with cerebral, ophthalmological, and upper limb symptoms, eg dizziness, visual changes, weak arm pulses. Systemic features are common—eg fever, weight loss, and malaise. BP is often a feature, due to renal artery stenosis. Complications include aortic valve regurgitation, aortic aneurysm and dissection; ischaemic stroke (BP and thrombus); and ischaemic heart disease. Diagnosis: ESR and CRP; MRI/PET allows earlier diagnosis than standard angiography. ℞: Prednisolone (1mg/kg/d PO). Methotrexate or cyclophosphamide have been used in resistant cases. BP control is essential to risk of stroke. Angioplasty ± stenting, or bypass surgery is performed for critical stenosis. Prognosis: ~95% survival at 15 years.

## Tietze's syndrome (Idiopathic costochondritis.)
Localized pain/tenderness at the costosternal junction, enhanced by motion, coughing, or sneezing. The 2nd rib is most often affected. The diagnostic key is localized tenderness which is marked (flinches on prodding). Treatment: Simple analgesia, eg NSAIDS. Its importance is that it is a benign cause of what at first seems to be alarming, eg cardiac pain. In lengthy illness, local steroid injections may be used.

## Todd's palsy
Transient neurological deficit (paresis) after a seizure. There may be face, arm, or leg weakness, aphasia, or gaze palsy, lasting from ~30min-36h. The aetiology is unclear.

## Vincent's angina (Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.)
Mouth infection with ulcerative gingivitis from Borrelia vincentii (a spirochaete) + fusiform bacilli, often affecting young ♂ smokers with poor oral hygiene. Try amoxicillin 500mg/8h and metronidazole 400mg/8h PO, + chlorhexidine mouthwash.

## Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
A dominant germline mutation of a tumour suppressor gene. It predisposes to bilateral renal cysts and clear cell renal carcinoma (p320), retinal & cerebellar haemangioblastoma, and phaeochromocytoma. See figs 15.19, 15.20. It may present with visual impairment or cerebellar signs (eg unilateral ataxia).

## Von Willebrand's disease (VWD)
Von Willebrand's factor (VWF) has three roles in clotting: 1 To bring platelets into contact with exposed subendothelium. 2 To make platelets bind to each other. 3 To bind to factor VIII, protecting it from destruction in the circulation. There are >22 types of VWD; the commonest are:

Type I: (60-80%) ↓Levels of of VWF. Symptoms are mild. Autosomal dominant.
Type II: (20-30%) Abnormal VWF, with lack of high-molecular-weight multimers. Usually autosomal dominant inheritance. Bleeding tendency varies. There are 4 subtypes.
Type III: (1-5%) Undetectable VWF levels (autosomal recessive with gene deletions). VWF antigen is lacking and there is ↓factor VIII. Symptoms can be severe.

Signs are of a platelet-type disorder (p344): bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, ↑bleeding post-tooth extraction. Tests: ↑APTT, ↑bleeding time, ↓factor VIIIC (clotting activity), VWF ↓Ag; ↔INR and platelets. ℞: Get expert help. Desmopressin is used in mild bleeding, VWF-containing factor VIII concentrate for surgery or major bleeds. Avoid NSAIDS.

## Wallenberg's lateral medullary syndrome
This relatively common syndrome comprises lesions to multiple CNS nuclei, caused by posterior or inferior cerebellar artery occlusion leading to brainstem infarction (fig 15.21). Features: • Dysphagia, dysarthria (IX and X nuclei). • Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus (vestibular nucleus). • Ipsilateral ataxia (inferior cerebellar peduncle). • Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome (descending sympathetic fibres). • Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (V nucleus) and contralateral limbs (spinothalamic tract). There is no limb weakness as the pyramidal tracts are unaffected.

In the rarer medial medullary syndrome, vertebral or anterior spinal artery occlusion causes ipsilateral tongue paralysis (XII nucleus) with contralateral limb weakness (pyramidal tract, sparing the face) and loss of position sense.
