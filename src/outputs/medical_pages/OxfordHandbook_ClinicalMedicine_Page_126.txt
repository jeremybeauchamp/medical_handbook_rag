## Cardiac catheterization

This involves the insertion of a catheter into the heart via the femoral or radial artery or venous system, and manipulating it within the heart and great vessels to:

- Inject radiopaque contrast medium to image cardiac anatomy and blood flow, see fig 3.18a.
- Perform angioplasty (ballooning and stenting), valvuloplasty (eg transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, fig 3.45)), cardiac biopsies, transcatheter septal defect closure.
- Perform electrophysiology studies and radiofrequency ablations.
- Sample blood to assess oxygen saturation and measure pressures.
- Perform intravascular ultrasound or echocardiography.

During the procedure, ECG and arterial pressures are monitored continuously. In the UK, the majority are performed as day-case procedures.

### Indications

- Coronary artery disease: diagnostic (assessment of coronary vessels and graft patency); therapeutic (angioplasty, stent insertion), fig 3.18b.
- Valvular disease: diagnostic (pressures indicate severity); therapeutic valvuloplasty (if the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery).
- Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by measuring pressures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy).
- Other: cardiomyopathy; pericardial disease; endomyocardial biopsy.

### Pre-procedure checks

- Brief history/examination; NB: peripheral pulses, bruits, aneurysms.
- Investigations: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting screen, CXR, ECG.
- Consent for procedure, including possible extra procedures, eg consent for angioplasty if planning to do angiography as you may find a lesion that needs stenting. Explain reason for procedure and possible complications.
- IV access, ideally in the left hand.
- Patient should be nil by mouth (NBM) from 6h before the procedure.
- Patients should take all their morning drugs (and pre-medication if needed)—but withhold oral hypoglycaemics.

### Post-procedure checks

- Pulse, BP, arterial puncture site (for bruising or swelling), foot pulses.
- Investigations: FBC and clotting (if suspected blood loss), ECG.

### Complications

- Haemorrhage: apply firm pressure over puncture site. If you suspect a false aneurysm, ultrasound the swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high risk for infections.
- Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contrast agents.
- Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due to dissection, thrombosis, or arterial spasm. Occurs in <1% of brachial catheterizations. Rare with femoral catheterization.
- Angina: may occur during or after cardiac catheterization. Usually responds to sublingual GTN; if not, give analgesia and IV nitrates.
- Arrhythmias: usually transient. Manage along standard lines.
- Pericardial effusion: suspect if unexplained continued chest pain. May need drain depending on severity and haemodynamic status.
- Pericardial tamponade: rare, but should be suspected if the patient becomes hypotensive and anuric. ⚠️ Urgent pericardial drain.
- Infection: post-catheter pyrexia is usually due to a contrast reaction. If it persists for >24h, take blood cultures before giving antibiotics.

Mortality <1 in 1000 patients, in most centres.

### Intracardiac electrophysiology

This catheter technique can determine types and origins of arrhythmias, and locate and ablate problem areas, eg aberrant pathways in WPW or arrhythmogenic foci. Arrhythmias may be induced, and the effectiveness of control by drugs assessed.
