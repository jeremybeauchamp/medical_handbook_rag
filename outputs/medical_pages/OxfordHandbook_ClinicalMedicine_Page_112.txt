# ECG—abnormalities

**Sinus tachycardia** All impulses are initiated in the sinoatrial node ('sinus rhythm') hence all QRSs are preceded by a normal P wave with a normal PR interval. Tachycardia means rate >100bpm. See p127.

**Sinus bradycardia** Sinus rhythm at a rate <60bpm. Causes: Physical fitness, vasovagal attacks, sick sinus syndrome, drugs (β-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone), hypothyroidism, hypothermia, intracranial pressure, cholestasis. See p122.

**AF** (ECG p125) Common causes: IHD, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, alcohol. See p130.

**Heart block (HB)** (See fig 3.5.) Disrupted passage of electrical impulse through the AV node.

- 1st-degree HB: The PR interval is prolonged and unchanging; no missed beats.
- 2nd-degree HB: Mobitz I: The PR interval becomes longer and longer until a QRS is missed, the pattern then resets. This is Wenckebach phenomenon.
- 2nd-degree HB: Mobitz II: QRSs are regularly missed. eg P - QRS - P - - P - QRS - P - - this would be Mobitz II with 2:1 block (2P:1QRS). This is a dangerous rhythm as it may progress to complete heart block.

1st- and 2nd-degree HB may be caused by: normal variant, athletes, sick sinus syndrome, IHD (esp inferior MI), acute myocarditis, drugs (digoxin, β-blockers).

3rd-degree HB: Complete heart block: No impulses are passed from atria to ventricles so P waves and QRSs appear independently of each other. As tissue distal to the AVN paces slowly, the patient becomes very bradycardic, and may develop haemodynamic compromise. Urgent treatment is required. Causes: IHD (esp inferior MI), idiopathic (fibrosis), congenital, aortic valve calcification, cardiac surgery/trauma, digoxin toxicity, infiltration (abscesses, granulomas, tumours, parasites).

**ST elevation** Normal variant (high take-off), acute MI (STEMI), Prinzmetal's angina (p708), acute pericarditis (saddle-shaped), left ventricular aneurysm.

**ST depression** Normal variant (upward sloping), digoxin toxicity (downward sloping), ischaemic (horizontal): angina, NSTEMI, acute posterior MI (ST depression in V1–V3).

**T inversion** In V1–V3: normal (black patients and children), right bundle branch block (RBBB), RV strain (eg secondary to PE). In V2–V5: anterior ischaemia, HCM, subarachnoid haemorrhage, lithium. In V4–V6 and aVL: lateral ischaemia, LVH, left bundle branch block (LBBB). In II, III and aVF: inferior ischaemia.

NB: ST- and T-wave changes are often non-specific, and must be interpreted in the light of the clinical context.

**Myocardial infarction** (See p118 and fig 3.21; example ECGs figs 3.9, 3.10)
- Within hours, the T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise.
- Within 24h, the T wave inverts. ST elevation rarely persists, unless a left ventricular aneurysm develops. T-wave inversion may or may not persist.
- Within a few days, pathological Q waves begin to form. Q waves usually persist, but may resolve in 10% of patients.
- The location of these changes indicates the ischaemic area location, see table 3.2.

**Pulmonary embolism** (fig 3.11) ECG findings may include: sinus tachycardia (commonest), RBBB (p100), right ventricular strain pattern (R-axis deviation, dominant R wave and T-wave inversion/ST depression in V1 and V2). Rarely, the 'SIQIIITIII' pattern occurs: deep S waves in I, pathological Q waves in III, inverted T waves in III.

**Metabolic abnormalities** Digoxin effect: Down-sloping ST depression and inverted T wave in V5-V6 ('reversed tick', see fig 3.19). In digoxin toxicity, any arrhythmia may occur (ventricular ectopics and nodal bradycardia are common). Hyperkalaemia: Tall, tented T wave, widened QRS, absent P waves, 'sine wave' appearance (see fig 14.4, p675). Hypokalaemia: Small T waves, prominent U waves, peaked P waves. Hypercalcaemia: Short QT interval. Hypocalcaemia: Long QT interval, small T waves. See p711 for causes of long QT intervals.
