## Thick ascending loop of Henle

### Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~10-30%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via electroneutral Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter.

### Pathology
Bartter syndromes: Due to impaired salt transport in the thick ascending loop. Sodium reabsorption increases further along the nephron in exchange for K+ and H+ ∴ all cause a hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic, metabolic alkalosis. Usually present in childhood. Divided into subtypes depending on transport molecule defect. Type 1 mimics a loop diuretic. Elevated prostaglandin levels are also a feature. Treatment is with salt replacement and the use of NSAIDs (after volume repletion).

### Diuretics
Loop diuretics (eg furosemide, bumetanide): Block the Na+/K+/2Cl- co-transporter in the thick ascending loop of Henle, hence increase the solute load of the filtrate and reduce water resorption. Increase excretion of water, Na+, Cl-, phosphate, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, and H+. They are readily absorbed from the GI tract (unless it is oedematous in which case IV may be needed) with peak concentration within 30-120min. Widely used in peripheral oedema (heart failure, ascites). They can also be used to treat hypercalcaemia. Side effects include hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, hypovolaemia, and ototoxicity.

## Distal tubule

### Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~5-10%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via NaCl co-transporter.

### Pathology
Gitelman syndrome: Loss of function of the NaCl co-transporter. Milder than Bartter syndrome: usually presents in adolescence/adulthood with incidental finding of electrolyte abnormalities. Mimics thiazide diuretic administration. Treat with electrolyte supplementation.

### Diuretics
Thiazide (eg bendroflumethiazide) and thiazide-like diuretics (eg indapamide, chlortalidone, metolazone): Inhibit the NaCl transporter ∴ decrease NaCl reabsorption and increase water loss. Used to treat BP (p140). Side effects: hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. However, calcium excretion is reduced (in contrast to loop diuretics) ∴ can be used to treat recurrent kidney stones in patients with hypercalciuria. Excretion of uric acid is reduced (care in gout). Glucose intolerance can occur (mechanism may be related to hypokalaemia) so care in DM. Increase in LDL cholesterol is not significant with chronic use at low dose, especially in the context of beneficial BP reduction.

## Cortical collecting duct

### Physiology
Acid-base and K+ homeostasis. Aldosterone acts to retain Na+and excrete K+.

### Pathology
Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Failure of acid (H+) excretion. Primary genetic disease or secondary to autoimmune disease (eg Sjögren's syndrome, SLE), toxins (eg lithium). Can cause, or be caused by, nephrocalcinosis (eg medullary sponge kidney, sarcoid). Leads to bone demineralization, renal calculi. Hypokalaemia can be severe. Diagnosis: urine fails to acidify (pH >5.3) despite metabolic acidosis. Treat with bicarbonate replacement and management of underlying disease. Type 4 RTA: Hyperkalaemia and acidosis due to (real or apparent) hypoaldosteronism, eg adrenal insufficiency, DM, ACE-i/ARB, K+-sparing diuretics.

### Diuretics
K+-sparing: aldosterone antagonists, eg spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride. Used in aldosteronism, heart failure, cirrhosis, K+-wasting states. Decrease Na+ and K+ excretion. Can cause ↑K+, acidosis. Oestrogenic effects with spironolactone.
