• Post-infection: arthralgia, hepatitis, orchitis, transverse myelitis, meningitis, uveitis, vision/hearing impairment, social isolation, psychological effects.

Diagnosis: PPE (see BOX 'Equipment') if high possibility (see 'Risk assessment'). WCC, plt, AST>ALT. IgM (~day 3), IgG (~day 7), reverse transcriptase PCR on blood/urine/saliva/throat swab. Exclude malaria. Treatment: Supportive: fluid resuscitation, correct electrolytes/coagulation/glucose, treat secondary infection, nutrition. Ribavirin not effective. Trace contacts, support family. Experimental: anti-RNA agents, immunotherapy with blood/plasma from survivors, monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp™), Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV, Ebola ça suffit! trial). Ethics: Randomization versus compassionate use: is it ethical to withhold even potentially beneficial therapy to a control group with a life-threatening condition? Is observational data gained through the compassionate use of experimental therapy sufficient to guide clinical decisions? Where should resources be directed to improve outcome: drug development or basic healthcare provision, eg would the capacity to check K+ improve mortality?

Marburg, Lassa, and CCHF
Differentiating features are given in table 9.23.

Table 9.23 Differentiation between VHF

| VHF | Clinical features |
|-----|-------------------|
| Marburg | Incubation typically 5-9d. Clinically identical disease course to Ebola. Ebola/Marburg suggested by liver tenderness. |
| Lassa | ~80% mild/asymptomatic. Haemorrhage in ~20%. Variable mortality in different epidemics 25-80%. Exudative pharyngitis. Convalescent hearing loss. Observational data shows response to ribavarin if given in first 6d. |
| CCHF | Tick-borne. Sudden onset prodrome. Haemorrhagic stage common, develops rapidly, but usually short-lived 2-3d. Ribavarin used in treatment (±evidence). |

Risk assessment for VHF in UK
Assess for possible transmission and fever.
• Transmission: 1 Travel to endemic area (rural for Lassa fever; caves/primates/antelopes/bats for Ebola/Marburg; tick/animal slaughter for CCHF). 2 Travel to known outbreak (http://www.promedmail.org). 3 Contact with infected specimen.
• Fever: >37.5°C in the past 24h.
If possible transmission and fever consider 'high possibility' (≠high probability), isolate, PPE (see BOX 'Equipment'). Inform local infectious disease team and contact the Imported Fever Service (0844 778 8990) for VHF investigation. Bruising, bleeding, and uncontrolled D&V also warrant isolation and discussion if relevant contact history.

## Ebola and sacrifice

This page is dedicated to Dr Sam Brisbane, director of the emergency department in Monrovia, Liberia. Caring, light-hearted, intense, profane. In 2013, he expressed his greatest worry: an epidemic of VHF. A well-founded fear which would ultimately prove prophetic, in a hospital with a shortage of personnel, rationing of gloves, and limited soap. Universal precautions? Unaffordable, and not even close. He was also a coffee farmer. But not for him a deserved retirement to his plantation, surrounded by photographs of 8 children, 6 adopted children, and grandchildren to match. Unprotected, despite a lucky fedora and a gallows sense of humour, he contracted Ebola in 2014 at the age of 74 whilst manning the front line of the world's deadliest VHF epidemic to date. During his illness he told his doctors, 'When we find ourselves in the middle of the sea and there are rough waves, we should not give up. We should fight on to the end'. A truly sagacious man whose life and doctoring transcends Western perspectives. We can never replicate your courage, because we will never know your fear. It is fittingly, the stuff of legend.
