# Introduction to emergencies

Some doctors enjoy the adrenaline rush of seeing an emergency case and pulling someone back from the edge of death. Some fear the emergency take, worried as to what they will miss, how many will die. There is no right approach; the emergency room needs both thought and practicality to manage patients. A patient who comes in flat and can be resuscitated gives the whole team a boost, as right there in front of us is the proof that we can make a difference. However, a patient who comes in well and collapses, dying before we can even decide what is wrong, can bring the whole team down. There are nights where we save life after life, and nights where we can't; sometimes a death is inevitable, despite our best efforts.

You are a doctor, but you are a human being as well, and losing a patient can feel like a personal failure. However, remember that when we lose a patient it is the disease that has killed them, not us. Try to take a few minutes and reflect on what happened; ask if you could have done anything differently. Should you have sought help sooner? Discussing with a senior can be helpful, as can writing down your reflection, not in a portfolio for discussion at your appraisal, but in anonymous format for your own education. Watch the team at an arrest, the best leaders are the ones who have learned to stand back, assess the whole situation, and take enough time to see where the critical intervention is needed. There is no substitute for experience, nobody becomes a consultant overnight, but watch the best clinicians at work and you will learn both practical and life skills.

Most important in an emergency situation is communication. Wherever you can, involve the relatives and the whole team in discussions, but remember that at the heart of this is a patient. What do they want? Never be afraid to ask the patient directly, they may hold very strong views. However, it is up to us as physicians to be honest with them about their prognosis—do not offer a treatment you know is not in the best interests of the patient, and this includes resuscitation. When faced with death, many patients are afraid—our role is to try to relieve that fear, whether by intervening to delay death, or by easing their passing. But we cannot ever prevent death, we simply delay it. As Shakespeare has Julius Caesar say:

'Of all the wonders that I have yet heard, it seems to me most strange that men should fear, seeing that death, a necessary end, will come when it will come.'

## ABCDE preliminary assessment (primary survey)

| Assessment | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Airway | Protect cervical spine, if injury possible.<br>Assessment: any signs of obstruction? Ascertain patency.<br>Management: establish a patent airway. |
| Breathing | Assessment: determine respiratory rate, check bilateral chest movement, percuss, and auscultate.<br>Management: if no respiratory effort, treat as arrest (see p894, fig A3), intubate and ventilate. If breathing compromised, give high-concentration O2, manage according to findings, eg relieve tension pneumothorax. |
| Circulation | Assessment: check pulse and BP; check if peripherally shut down; check capillary refill; look for evidence of haemorrhage.<br>Management: if shocked, treat as on p790.<br>If no cardiac output, treat as arrest (see p894, fig A3). |
| Disability | Assess 'level of consciousness' with AVPU score (alert? responds to voice? to pain? unresponsive?); check pupils: size, equality, reactions.<br>Glasgow Coma Scale, if time allows. |
| Exposure | Undress patient, but cover to avoid hypothermia. |

Quick history from relatives assists diagnosis: Events surrounding onset of illness, evidence of overdose/suicide attempt, any suggestion of trauma? Past medical history, especially diabetes, asthma, COPD, alcohol, opiate or street drug abuse, epilepsy or recent head injury, recent travel. Medication, current drugs. Allergies.

Once ventilation and circulation are adequate, proceed to carry out history, examination, investigations, and management in the usual way.
