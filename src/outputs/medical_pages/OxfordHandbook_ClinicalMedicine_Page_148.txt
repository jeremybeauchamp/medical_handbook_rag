# Heart failure—basic concepts

**Definition** Cardiac output is inadequate for the body's requirements.³³

**Prevalence** 1-3% of the general population; ~10% among elderly patients.³⁴

## Key classifications

**Systolic failure:** Inability of the ventricle to contract normally, resulting in ↓cardiac output. Ejection fraction (EF) is <40%. Causes: IHD, MI, cardiomyopathy.

**Diastolic failure:** Inability of the ventricle to relax and fill normally, causing ↑filling pressures. Typically EF is >50%, this is termed HFpEF (heart failure with preserved EF). Causes: ventricular hypertrophy, constrictive pericarditis, tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathy, obesity. NB: systolic and diastolic failure pathophysiology often coexists.

**Left ventricular failure (LVF):** Symptoms: dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance, fatigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND), nocturnal cough (±pink frothy sputum), wheeze (cardiac 'asthma'), nocturia, cold peripheries, weight loss.

**Right ventricular failure (RVF):** Causes: LVF, pulmonary stenosis, lung disease (cor pulmonale, see p194). Symptoms: peripheral oedema (up to thighs, sacrum, abdominal wall), ascites, nausea, anorexia, facial engorgement, epistaxis.

LVF and RVF may occur independently, or together as congestive cardiac failure (CCF).

**Acute heart failure:** Often used exclusively to mean new-onset acute or decompensation of chronic heart failure characterized by pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema with or without signs of peripheral hypoperfusion. **Chronic heart failure:** Develops or progresses slowly. Venous congestion is common but arterial pressure is well maintained until very late.

**Low-output heart failure:** Cardiac output is ↓ and fails to ↑ normally with exertion.
Causes:
- Excessive preload: eg mitral regurgitation or fluid overload (eg renal failure or too rapid IV infusions, particularly in the elderly and those with established HF).
- Pump failure: systolic and/or diastolic HF (see above), ↓heart rate (eg β-blockers, heart block, post MI), negatively inotropic drugs (eg most antiarrhythmic agents).
- Chronic excessive afterload: eg aortic stenosis, hypertension.

Excessive preload can cause ventricular dilatation, this exacerbates pump failure.
Excessive afterload prompts ventricular muscle thickening (ventricular hypertrophy), resulting in stiff walls and diastolic dysfunction.

**High-output heart failure:** This is rare. Here, output is normal or increased in the face of ↑↑needs. Failure occurs when cardiac output fails to meet these needs. It will occur with a normal heart, but even earlier if there is heart disease. Causes: anaemia, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, Paget's disease, arteriovenous malformation, beriberi. Consequences: initially features of RVF; later LVF becomes evident.

**Diagnosis** Requires symptoms of failure (see above) and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest. For CCF, use the Framingham criteria.³⁵

**Signs** As described previously plus cyanosis, ↓BP, narrow pulse pressure, pulsus alternans, displaced apex (LV dilatation), RV heave (pulmonary hypertension), signs of valve diseases. Severity can be graded using the New York classification (see BOX).

**Investigations** According to NICE,³³ if ECG and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; p137) are normal, heart failure is unlikely, and an alternative diagnosis should be considered; if either is abnormal, then echocardiography (p110) is required.

**Tests** FBC; U&E; BNP; CXR (see fig 3.38); ECG; echo. ECG may indicate cause (look for evidence of ischaemia, MI, or ventricular hypertrophy). It is rare to get a completely normal ECG in chronic heart failure. Echocardiography is the key investigation.³⁶ It may indicate the cause (MI, valvular heart disease) and can confirm the presence or absence of LV dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely needed.

**Prognosis** Poor with ~25-50% of patients dying within 5yrs of diagnosis. If admission is needed, 5yr mortality ≈75%. Be realistic: in one study, 54% of those dying in the next 72h had been expected to live for >6months.³⁷
