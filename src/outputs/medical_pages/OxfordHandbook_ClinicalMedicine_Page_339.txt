Fig 8.3 'Conjunctival pallor', the classic sign of anaemia, is a confusing term as the conjunctiva is translucent, transmitting the colour of structures under it. The 'pallor' refers to the vasculature on the inner surface of the lid which is lacking Hb. It is this colour [pale pink image] but it should be: [bright pink image]

## Red cell distribution width (RCDW or RDW)

In health or in unifactorial anaemia, all the red cells in a sample are about the same size, and the graph of their volume distribution forms a narrow peak. In mixed anaemias, however, this peak broadens, reflecting an abnormally large RDWâ€”this may be the first clue to dual pathology. In coeliac disease, for example, poor absorption of iron (MCV) and folate (MCV) may occur simultaneously, resulting in a combination of microcytes and macrocytes in the circulation. The visual analogue of this is anisocytosis (p328) on a blood film. The laboratory measure is a RDW, where RDW = the standard deviation of MCV divided by the mean MCV, multiplied by 100. Reference interval: 11.5-14.6%. If the MCV is high and the RDW is normal, the cause is likely to be alcohol, liver disease, or a marrow problem (chemotherapy or aplastic anaemia).
