Fig 10.31 Winging of both scapulae in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, due to weakness of thoracoscapular muscles.

The image shows the back of a person with their arms held forward, revealing prominent protrusion of both shoulder blades (scapulae) from the back. This condition is known as scapular winging and is characteristic of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.

Table 10.12 Genetics of some commoner congenital myopathies

| Condition | Inheritance | Chr | Gene | Pathogenesis |
|-----------|-------------|-----|------|--------------|
| Duchenne's muscular dystrophy | X-linked recessive | X | Dystrophin (stabilizes muscle fibres) | Partial deletions or duplications in dystrophin render non-functional |
| Becker's muscular dystrophy | X-linked recessive | X | Dystrophin | Partial deletions or duplications in dystrophin render hypo-functional |
| FSHD type 1 | Autosomal dominant | 4 | DUX4 (transcriptional activator) | Partial deletion of D4Z4 repeating unit releases normal repression of DUX4 expression |
| FSHD type 2 | Autosomal dominant | 4 | DUX4 (transcriptional activator) | Hypomethylation of D4Z4 releases normal repression of DUX4 expression |
| DM type 1 | Autosomal dominant | 19 | DMPK (serine-threonine kinase) | Expansion of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides; in both forms this expanded sequence is transcribed into RNA which then misfolds and sequesters other RNA binding proteins |
| DM type 2 | Autosomal dominant | 3 | ZNF9 (transcriptional regulator) | Expansion of short repetitive sequences of nucleotides; in both forms this expanded sequence is transcribed into RNA which then misfolds and sequesters other RNA binding proteins |
