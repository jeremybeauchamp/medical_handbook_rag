# The cardiovascular system: examination 1

Introduce yourself, obtain consent to examine, and position the patient appropriately: lying on a bed, sitting up at 45Â°. Expose them to the waist (for female patients, delay until examining the praecordium). Explain what you are doing throughout.

## 1 General inspection
- Assess general state (ill/well)
- Look for clues (oxygen, GTN spray)
- Colour (pale, cyanosed, flushed)
- Short of breath?
- Scars on chest wall (fig 2.3)?

Fig 2.3 CABG scar.

## 2 Hands
- Temperature: Capillary refill time
- Inspect:
  Skin: tobacco staining, peripheral cyanosis (fig 2.4), tendon xanthomata, Janeway lesions, Osler's nodes (signs of infective endocarditis)
  Nails: clubbing, splinter haemorrhages, nail bed pulsation (Quincke's sign of aortic regurgitation)

## 3 Radial and brachial pulses
- Radial: Rate, rhythm; radio-radial delay (palpate pulse bilaterally simultaneously), radiofemoral delay (palpate ipsilateral pulses simultaneously), collapsing pulse (identify radial pulse (fig 2.5), then wrap your fingers around wrist. Before elevating arm from the elbow check for pain in arm/shoulder. Lift arm straight up: collapsing pulse, felt as 'waterhammer' pulsation.
- Brachial: (Just medial to tendinous insertion of biceps.) Waveform character.

## 4 Blood pressure
- Hyper- or hypotensive?
- Pulse pressure (wide = aortic regurgitation, arteriosclerosis, narrow = aortic stenosis, dry)

## 5 Neck
- JVP: Ask patient to turn head to the left and look at the supraclavicular fossa (see fig 2.6 and p43). Comment on the height of the JVP and waveform. Press on the abdomen to check the abdomino-jugular reflex.
- Carotid pulse: inspect (visible carotid = Corrigan's sign of aortic regurgitation), and palpate volume and character on one side then the other.
