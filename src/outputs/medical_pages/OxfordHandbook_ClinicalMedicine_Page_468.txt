# 454 Dermatomes and peripheral nerves

![Diagram of dermatomes and peripheral nerves on human body]

The image shows a diagram of the human body with labeled dermatomes and peripheral nerves. The body is divided into colored sections representing different nerve distributions.

## Nerve distributions:

- **Trigeminal**: 
  - Ophthalmic division (V1)
  - Maxillary division (V2)
  - Mandibular division (V3)
- Great auricular, C2, C3
- Cervical plexus, superficial branches
- **Intercostal nerves T2-T11**:
  - Lateral cutaneous br.
  - Anterior cutaneous br.
- **Brachial plexus**:
  - Axillary
  - Intercostobrachial
  - Medial cutaneous
  - Musculocutaneous
  - Radial (Posterior cutaneous, Superficial branch)
  - Median
  - Ulnar
- **Lumbar plexus**:
  - Ilioinguinal
  - Genitofemoral
  - Lateral cutaneous
  - Femoral (Anterior cutaneous rami, Saphenous)
- **Sacral plexus**:
  - Sciatic
    - Lateral cutaneous nerve of calf
    - Superficial and deep peroneal
    - Sural
    - Medial plantar

The diagram also shows dermatome labels from C3 to S1.

**Fig 10.5** The white areas denote terra incognita: considerable inter-individual variation exists, and no single best option can be given.

**Fig 10.6** Pain in a dermatomal distribution suggests a problem with a cranial nerve or dorsal root ganglion (radiculopathy)â€”where the cell bodies of sensory fibres live. What is the dermatome? What is the lesion? See p404 for the answer.

## Aim to keep a few key dermatomes up your sleeve (C5-T2)

| Dermatome | Area                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| C3-4      | Clavicles                      |
| C6-7      | Lateral arm/forearm            |
| T1        | Medial side of arm             |
| C6        | Thumb                          |
| C7        | Middle finger                  |
| C8        | Little finger                  |
| T4        | Nipples                        |
| T10       | Umbilicus                      |
| L1        | Inguinal ligament              |
| L2-3      | Anterior and inner leg         |
| L5        | Medial side of big toe         |
| L5, S1-2  | Posterior and outer leg        |
| S1        | Lateral margin of foot and little toe |
| S2-4      | Perineum                       |
