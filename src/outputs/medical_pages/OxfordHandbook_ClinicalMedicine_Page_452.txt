## Eye disease

### Conjunctivitis
Common in tropical areas. Vision is normal. Differentiation between common infectious causes is outlined in table 9.29.

| Cause | Secretions | Features | Treatment |
|-------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Bacterial | Purulent | Red and swollen | Topical antibiotics for 5d |
| Viral | Watery | ± Corneal lesion | Symptomatic |
| Trachoma (chlamydial) | Mucopurulent | Follicles and papillae on lid | Azithromycin PO or topical tetracycline |

### Trachoma
Leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide: visual impairment/blindness in 1.9 million, 200 million at risk. Prevalence in endemic areas 60- 90% (Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Middle East). Caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Human-to-human transmission with contact, or via flies which land on noses/eyes. Presentation: Active infection causes purulent discharge and follicular inflammation of the eyelid (fig 9.47a)→scarring (fig 9.47b)→eyelids turn inwards (entropion) and irritate the cornea (trichiasis) (fig 9.47c) leading to visual loss.

Treatment: WHO public health strategy SAFE: surgery to treat blinding disease (trichiasis), antibiotics (azithromycin) to clear infection (mass administration in endemic areas through International Trachoma Initiative), facial cleanliness, environmental improvement with access to water and sanitation.

### Immunosuppression and the eye
• Herpes zoster ophthalmicus:
Due to reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (p404) in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. Risk of reactivation and ocular complications in immunosuppression: HIV, post-transplantation. Presentation: vesiculomacular skin rash and dysaesthesia in ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (fig 9.48). Hutchinson's sign = lesion at tip/side of nose indicates involvement of nasociliary branch of V1 and chance of eye involvement. Complications: corneal opacification, uveitis, ocular nerve palsy, eyelid deformity, optic neuritis, post-herpetic neuralgia. Can be sight-threatening ∴ recognition and urgent treatment are required. Diagnosis: clinical. Antibody staining/PCR of skin scrapings. Treatment: oral famciclovir/valacyclovir or systemic aciclovir reduce complications if given within 72h of symptoms. Analgesia. If retinitis IV cidofovir ± intravitreal ganciclovir or foscarnet.

• CMV retinitis:
Reactivation of CMV infection (p405). Presentation: floaters due to inflammatory cells in vitreous, flashing lights, scotomata, eye pain, visual loss. Peripheral lesions
