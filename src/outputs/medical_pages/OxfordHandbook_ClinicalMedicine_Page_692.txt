# 678 Hypocalcaemia

Apparent hypocalcaemia may be an artefact of hypoalbuminaemia (p676).

## Signs and symptoms
See BOX.11 Mild: cramps, perioral numbness/paraesthesiae.
Severe: carpopedal spasm (especially if brachial artery compressed, Trousseau's
sign; see fig 14.6), laryngospasm, seizures. Neuromuscular excitability may also be
demonstrated by tapping over parotid (facial nerve) causing facial muscles to twitch
(Chvostek's sign; see fig 14.7). Cataract if chronic hypocalcaemia. ECG: Long QT interval.

## Causes

| With ↑PO43- | With ↔ or ↓PO43- |
|-------------|-------------------|
| • Chronic kidney disease (p302). | • Vitamin D deficiency. |
| • Hypoparathyroidism (incl thyroid or parathyroid surgery, p222). | • Osteomalacia (↑ALP). |
| • Pseudohypoparathyroidism (p222). | • Acute pancreatitis. |
| • Acute rhabdomyolysis. | • Over-hydration. |
| • Hypomagnesaemia. | • Respiratory alkalosis (total Ca2+ is normal, but ionized Ca2+ ↓ due to ↑pH ∴ symptomatic). |

## Treatment
• Mild symptoms: Give calcium 5mmol/6h PO, with daily plasma Ca2+ levels.
• In chronic kidney disease: See p302. May require alfacalcidol, eg 0.5–1mcg/24h PO.
• Severe symptoms: Give 10mL of 10% calcium gluconate (2.25mmol) IV over 30min,
  and repeat as necessary. If due to respiratory alkalosis, correct the alkalosis.

## Features of hypocalcaemia 'SPASMODIC'

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| S | Spasms (carpopedal spasms = Trousseau's sign) |
| P | Perioral paraesthesiae |
| A | Anxious, irritable, irrational |
| S | Seizures |
| M | Muscle tone ↑ in smooth muscle—hence colic, wheeze, and dysphagia |
| O | Orientation impaired (time, place, and person) and confusion |
| D | Dermatitis (eg atopic/exfoliative) |
| I | Impetigo herpetiformis (↓Ca2+ and pustules in pregnancy—rare and serious) |
| C | Chvostek's sign; choreoathetosis; cataract; cardiomyopathy (long QT interval on ECG). |

Fig 14.6 Trousseau's sign: on inflating the cuff, the wrist and fingers flex and draw together (carpopedal spasm).

Fig 14.7 Chvostek's sign: the corner of the mouth twitches when the facial nerve is tapped over the parotid.
