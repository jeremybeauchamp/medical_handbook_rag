## Fig 10.7 Posterior view.

This image shows a posterior view of the human body, illustrating the cutaneous innervation patterns. The body is divided into color-coded regions corresponding to different nerve distributions:

| Region | Nerves |
|--------|--------|
| Head | Ophthalmic division, Maxillary division, Mandibular division (Trigeminal) |
| Neck | Mastoid branch (C2, C3), Great auricular branch (C2, C3) (Superficial cervical plexus) |
| Upper back | Occipital (C2-C8), Supraclavicular (C3, C4) |
| Trunk | Dorsal rami of thoracic nerves (T2-T12) |
| Upper limb | Cutaneous branch of axillary, Lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves, Medial and lateral cutaneous br. of radial, Medial cutaneous, Intercostobrachial, Musculocutaneous, Superficial branch of radial |
| Lower back and buttocks | Gluteal branch of 12th intercostal, Lateral cutaneous br. of iliohypogastric, Lateral branches of dorsal lumbar and sacral rami, Medial branches of dorsal rami (L1-S6) |
| Lower limb | Perforating branch of posterior cutaneous (Pudendal plexus), Lateral cutaneous, Obturator, Medial cutaneous, Saphenous (Femoral, Lumbar plexus), Posterior cutaneous, Superficial peroneal, Sural, Tibial, Lateral plantar (Common peroneal, Sacral plexus) |

## Fig 10.8 The anterior 1/3 of the scrotum is L1; the posterior 2/3 is S3. The penis is S2/3 (L1 at its root).

This diagram shows the innervation of the male genitalia:

| Region | Innervation |
|--------|-------------|
| Anterior 1/3 of scrotum | L1 |
| Posterior 2/3 of scrotum | S3 |
| Penis | S2/3 (L1 at its root) |

## Fig 10.9 Feet and hands.

This figure illustrates the cutaneous innervation of the feet and hands:

### Cutaneous innervation of the foot

| Nerve | Number | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Saphenous nerve | 1 | Dorsal surface |
| Deep peroneal nerve | 2 | Dorsal surface |
| Superficial peroneal nerve | 3 | Dorsal surface |
| Medial plantar nerve | 4 | Plantar surface |
| Lateral plantar nerve | 5 | Plantar surface |
| Calcaneal branch (tibial nerve) | 6 | Plantar surface |
| Sural nerve | 7 | Both surfaces |

### Cutaneous innervation of the hand

| Surface | Nerves |
|---------|--------|
| Palmar surface | Median, Ulnar |
| Dorsal surface | Superficial branch of radial, Dorsal cutaneous branch of ulnar, Median |
