Distribution of colorectal carcinomas

| Right side | Left side |
|------------|-----------|
| Hepatic flexure 3% | Splenic flexure 2% |
| Ascending colon 7% | Transverse colon 5% |
| Caecum 14% | Descending colon 3% |
| Appendix 1% | Sigmoid colon 20% |
| | Rectum 27% |
| | Anus 2% |
| | Other and unspecified 9% |

## TNM staging in colorectal cancer

Table 13.13 Colorectal cancer: TNM staging

| T | Primary tumour | N | Lymph nodes |
|---|----------------|---|--------------|
| Tx | Primary tumour cannot be assessed | Nx | Nodes cannot be assessed |
| Tis | Carcinoma in situ | N0 | No node spread |
| T1 | Invading submucosa | N1 | Metastases in 1-3 regional nodes |
| T2 | Invading muscularis propria | N2 | Metastases in >3 regional nodes |
| T3 | Invading subserosa and beyond (not other organs) | M0 | No distant spread |
| T4 | Invasion of adjacent structures | M1 | Distant metastasis |

TNM status used to define overall stage. This is complex with several important subtypes, but in essence, stage 1 disease is T1 or T2/N0/M0; stage 2 is T3 or T4/N0/M0; stage 3 is characterized by N1 or N2 but still M0; stage 4 is M1.

## Polyps, the challenges of screening, and the NHS

Polyps are growths that appear above the mucosa and can be inflammatory, hamartomatous, or neoplastic. Left in situ, polyps carry a risk of malignant transformation that will relate to size and histology (tubular or villous adenomas, esp. if >2cm). Patients with polyps may have no symptoms and thus a colonoscopy is required to detect and remove. Colonoscopy allows the opportunity to detect colorectal cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more effective.

However, population-based colonoscopic screening is costly and some studies have suggested that the test does not impact on deaths from right-sided cancers which are rarer and harder to detect (fig 13.34). Therefore, the NHS has introduced a one-off screening flexible sigmoidoscopy offered to all people in their 55th year. Trial results have shown the incidence of colorectal cancer in the intervention (screening) group is reduced by 33% and mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced by 43%. Number needed to screen to prevent one diagnosis (=191); or death (=489).

In parallel, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (introduced in 2006) offers colonoscopy to all men and women aged 60-75 who test positive for faecal occult blood (FOB) using a home testing kit performed every 2 years. This FOB-stratification targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting detection of more advanced adenomas and early stage cancers. The relative risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients undergoing screening is reduced by 16%. A 11% increase in incidence rates since 2006 for people aged 60-69 is almost certainly due to earlier detection through the screening programme.
