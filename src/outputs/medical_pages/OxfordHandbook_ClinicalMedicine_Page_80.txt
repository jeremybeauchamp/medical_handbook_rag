## Neurological examination of the upper limbs

The neurological system is usually the most daunting examination, so learn at the bedside from a senior colleague, preferably a neurologist. Keep practising. Be aware that books present ideal situations: often one or more signs are equivocal or even contrary to expectation; consider signs in the context of the history and try re-examining the patient, as signs may evolve over time. The only essential point is to distinguish whether weakness is upper (UMN) or lower (LMN) motor neuron (p446). Position the patient comfortably, sitting up at 45° and with arms exposed. The order of examination should be Inspection, Tone, Power, Reflexes, Coordination, Sensation (fig 2.31).

### 1 General inspection
Abnormal posturing, asymmetry, abnormal movements (fasciculation/tremor/dystonia/athetosis), muscle wasting (especially small muscles of the hand)—symmetrical/asymmetrical? Local/general?

### 2 Tone
Ask patient to 'relax/go floppy like a rag-doll'. Ask if patient has any pain in hands/arm/shoulder before passively flexing and extending limb while also pronating and supinating the forearm. Any spasticity or rigidity?

### 3 Power
Direct patient to adopt each position and follow commands while you as the examiner stabilize the joint above and resist movements as appropriate to grade power (see BOX 'Muscle weakness grading' on p446). Test each muscle group bilaterally before moving on to the next position. See p452-3 for myotomes.

- 'Shrug your shoulders and don't let me push down; push your arms out to the side against me; try to pull them back in.'
- 'Hold your arms up like this and pull me towards you, now push me away.'
- 'Hold your hand out flat, don't let me push it down; now don't let me push it up.'
- Offer the patient two (crossed) fingers of yours and ask them to 'squeeze my fingers.'
- Ask patient to 'spread your fingers and stop me pushing them back together', then hand the patient a piece of paper to grip between two fingers. You as the examiner should grip the paper with your corresponding fingers while asking patient to 'grip the paper and don't let me pull it away.'
