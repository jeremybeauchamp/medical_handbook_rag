# Normal conduction

Normal conduction: initiated by the sinoatrial node (SAN), electrical activity spreads around the atria. The atrioventricular node (AVN) receives this activity, pauses, then passes it on, down the bundle of His which splits into left and right bundle branches. These cause depolarization of the ventricular myocardium from bottom (apex) to top (outflow tracts).

# Regular rhythm tachycardia

See fig 3.27.

## A. Sinus tachycardia:
Conduction occurs as per fig 3.26 but impulses are initiated at a high frequency. Causes include infection, pain, exercise, anxiety, dehydration, bleed, systemic vasodilation (eg in sepsis), drugs (caffeine, nicotine, salbutamol), anaemia, fever, PE, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, CO2 retention, autonomic neuropathy (eg inappropriate sinus tachycardia).

## B. Focal atrial tachycardia:
A group of atrial cells act as a pacemaker, out-pacing the SAN. P-wave morphology (shape) is different to sinus.

## C. Atrial flutter:
Electrical activity circles the atria 300 times per minute, giving a 'sawtooth' baseline, see fig 3.35. The AVN passes some of these impulses on, resulting in ventricular rates that are factors of 300 (150, 100, 75).

## D. Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia:
(AVRT) An accessory pathway (eg in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW), p133) allows electrical activity from the ventricles to pass to the resting atrial myocytes, creating a circuit: atria–AVN–ventricles–accessory pathway–atria. This direction is called 'orthodromic' conduction and results in narrow QRS complexes as ventricular depolarization is triggered via the bundles of His. Conduction in the other direction is called 'antidromic' and results in broad QRS complexes.

## E. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia:
(AVNRT) Circuits form within the AVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very common.

## F. Junctional tachycardia:
Cells in the AVN become the pacemaker, giving narrow QRS complexes as impulses reach the ventricles through the normal routes; P waves may be inverted and late.

## G. Bundle branch block:
Any of the above conditions can result in broad complex tachycardias if there is bundle branch block (see p100).

## H. Ventricular tachycardia:
(VT) This can result from circuits, similar to atrial flutter, or from focuses of rapidly-firing cells. The QRS is broad. When a circuit is in action and its plane rotates, the ECG shows broad complex tachycardia with regularly increasing and decreasing amplitudes; this is called torsades de pointes.
