# Pleural effusion

## Definitions
A pleural effusion is fluid in the pleural space. Effusions can be divided by their protein concentration into transudates (<25g/L) and exudates (>35g/L), see BOX. Blood in the pleural space is a haemothorax, pus in the pleural space is an empyema, and chyle (lymph with fat) is a chylothorax. Both blood and air in the pleural space is called a haemopneumothorax.

## Causes
**Transudates** may be due to venous pressure (cardiac failure, constrictive pericarditis, fluid overload), or hypoproteinaemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption). Also occur in hypothyroidism and Meigs' syndrome (right pleural effusion and ovarian fibroma). **Exudates** are mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural capillaries secondary to infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Causes: pneumonia; TB; pulmonary infarction; rheumatoid arthritis; SLE; bronchogenic carcinoma; malignant metastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitis carcinomatosis.

## Symptoms
Asymptomatic—or dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain.

## Signs
Decreased expansion; stony dull percussion note; diminished breath sounds occur on the affected side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are ↓ (inconstant and unreliable). Above the effusion, where lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing. With large effusions there may be tracheal deviation away from the effusion. Look for aspiration marks and signs of associated disease: malignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar); stigmata of chronic liver disease; cardiac failure; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthritis; butterfly rash of SLE.

## Tests
**CXR:** Small effusions blunt the costophrenic angles, larger ones are seen as water-dense shadows with concave upper borders. A completely flat horizontal upper border implies that there is also a pneumothorax.

**Ultrasound** is useful in identifying the presence of pleural fluid and in guiding diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration.

**Diagnostic aspiration:** Percuss the upper border of the pleural effusion and choose a site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (don't go too low or you'll be in the abdomen!). Infiltrate down to the pleura with 5-10mL of 1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids neurovascular bundle). Draw off 10-30mL of pleural fluid and send it to the lab for clinical chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amylase), bacteriology (microscopy and culture, auramine stain, TB culture), cytology, and, if indicated, immunology (rheumatoid factor, ANA, complement). See table 4.9.

**Pleural biopsy:** If pleural fluid analysis is inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy. Thoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling direct visualization of the pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas).

## Management
Management is of the underlying cause.

- **Drainage:** If the effusion is symptomatic, drain it, repeatedly if necessary. Fluid is best removed slowly (0.5-1.5L/24h). It may be aspirated in the same way as a diagnostic tap, or using an intercostal drain (see p766).
- **Pleurodesis** with talc may be helpful for recurrent effusions. Thorascopic mechanical pleurodesis is most effective for malignant effusions. Empyemas (p170) are best drained using a chest drain, inserted under ultrasound or CT guidance.
- **Intra-pleural alteplase and dornase alfa** may help with empyema.
- **Surgery:** Persistent collections and increasing pleural thickness (on ultrasound) requires surgery.
