# Mononeuropathies

Lesions of individual peripheral or cranial nerves. Causes are usually local, such as trauma, or entrapment (eg tumour), except for carpal tunnel syndrome (see BOX 'Carpal tunnel syndrome').

## Median nerve C6-T1
The median nerve is the nerve of precision grip—muscles involved are easier to remember if you use your 'LOAF' (two lumbricals, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis). The clinical features depend on the location of the lesion:
- At the wrist: (Eg see BOX 'Carpal tunnel syndrome'.) Weakness of abductor pollicis brevis and sensory loss over the radial 3½ fingers and palm.
- Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: (Eg trauma.) Weakness of flexion of the distal phalanx of the thumb and index finger.
- Proximal lesions: (Eg compression at the elbow.) May show combined defects.

## Ulnar nerve C7-T1
Vulnerable to elbow trauma. Signs: Weakness/wasting of medial (ulnar side) wrist flexors, interossei (cannot cross the fingers in the good luck sign), and medial two lumbricals (claw hand, more marked in wrist lesions with digitorum profundus intact); hypothenar eminence wasting, weak 5th digit abduction, and 4th and 5th DIP joint flexion; sensory loss over medial 1½ fingers and ulnar side of the hand. Treatment: see BOX 'Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments'.

## Radial nerve C5-T1
This nerve opens the fist. It may be damaged by compression against the humerus. Signs: Test for wrist and finger drop with elbow flexed and arm pronated; sensory loss is variable—the dorsal aspect of the root of the thumb (the anatomical snuff box) is most reliably affected. Muscles involved: ('BEAST') brachioradialis; extensors; abductor pollicis longus; supinator; triceps.

## Brachial plexus
Pain/paraesthesiae and weakness in the affected arm in a variable distribution. Causes: Trauma, radiotherapy (eg for breast carcinoma), prolonged wearing of a heavy rucksack, cervical rib, thoracic outlet compression (also affects vasculature), or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage-Turner syndrome: unilateral sudden, severe pain, followed over hours by profound weakness, resolving completely over days. May rarely involve the phrenic or lower cranial nerves.)

## Phrenic nerve C3-5
C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea with a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR. Causes: Lung cancer, TB, paraneoplastic syndromes, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma, thoracic surgery, infections (HZV, HIV, Lyme disease), muscular dystrophy.

## Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh L2-L3
Meralgia paraesthetica is anterolateral burning thigh pain from entrapment under the inguinal ligament.

## Sciatic nerve L4-S3
Damaged by pelvic tumours or fractures to pelvis or femur. Lesions affect the hamstrings and all muscles below the knee (foot drop), with loss of sensation below the knee laterally.

## Common peroneal nerve L4-S1
Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Often damaged as it winds round the fibular head (trauma, sitting cross-legged). Signs: Foot drop, weak ankle dorsiflexion/eversion, sensory loss over dorsal foot.

## Tibial nerve L4-S3
Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Lesions lead to an inability to stand on tiptoe (plantarflexion), invert the foot, or flex the toes, with sensory loss over the sole.

## Mononeuritis multiplex
Describes the involvement of two or more peripheral nerves. Causes tend to be systemic: DM, connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid, SLE), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly Wegener's granulomatosis, PAN), and more rarely sarcoidosis, amyloid, leprosy. Electromyography (EMG) helps define the anatomic site of lesions.
