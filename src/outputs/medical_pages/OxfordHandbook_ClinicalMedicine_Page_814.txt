# 800 Severe pulmonary oedema

## Causes
- Cardiovascular, usually left ventricular failure (post-MI or ischaemic heart disease). Also valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and malignant hypertension.
- ARDS (p186) from any cause, eg trauma, malaria, drugs. Look for predisposing factors, eg trauma, post-op, sepsis. Is aspirin overdose or glue-sniffing/drug abuse likely? Ask friends/relatives.
- Fluid overload.
- Neurogenic, eg head injury.

## Differential diagnosis
Asthma/COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema are often hard to distinguish, especially in the elderly, where they may coexist. If the patient is extremely unwell and you are not sure, consider treating all three (eg with salbutamol nebulizer, furosemide IV, diamorphine, amoxicillin—p386).

## Symptoms
Dyspnoea, orthopnoea (eg paroxysmal), pink frothy sputum. NB: note drugs recently given and other illnesses (recent MI/COPD or pneumonia).

## Signs
Distressed, pale, sweaty, ↑pulse, tachypnoea, pink frothy sputum, pulsus alternans, ↑JVP, fine lung crackles, triple/gallop rhythm (p44), wheeze (cardiac asthma). Usually sitting up and leaning forward. Quickly examine for possible causes.

## Investigations
- CXR (p135, pp722–4): cardiomegaly, signs of pulmonary oedema: look for shadowing (usually bilateral), small effusions at costophrenic angles, fluid in the lung fissures, and Kerley B lines (septal linear opacities).
- ECG: signs of MI, dysrhythmias.
- U&E, troponin, ABG.
- Consider echo.
- BNP (p137) may be helpful if diagnosis in question (high negative predictive value).

## Management
▶See fig 19.7. ▶▶Begin treatment before investigations.

Monitoring progress: BP; pulse; cyanosis; respiratory rate; JVP; urine output; ABG. Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia.

Once stable and improving:
- Daily weights, aim reduction of 0.5kg/day, check obs at least QDS.
- Repeat CXR.
- Change to oral furosemide or bumetanide.
- If on large doses of loop diuretic, consider the addition of a thiazide (eg bendroflumethiazide or metolazone 2.5–5mg daily PO).
- ACE-i if LVEF <40%. If ACE-i contraindicated, consider hydralazine and nitrate (may also be more effective in African-Caribbeans).
- Also consider β-blocker and spironolactone (if LVEF <35%).
- Is the patient suitable for biventricular pacing or cardiac transplantation?
- Optimize management of AF if present (p130); consider anticoagulation.
