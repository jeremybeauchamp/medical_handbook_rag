# Liver tumours

The commonest (90%) liver tumours are metastases (see fig 6.32), eg from breast, bronchus, or the gastrointestinal tract (see table 6.14). Primary hepatic tumours are much less common and may be benign or malignant (see table 6.13).

## Symptoms
Fever, malaise, anorexia, ↓weight, RUQ pain (∵ liver capsule stretch). Jaundice is late, except with cholangiocarcinoma. Benign tumours are often asymptomatic. Tumours may rupture causing intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

## Signs
Hepatomegaly (smooth, or hard and irregular, eg metastases, cirrhosis, HCC). Look for signs of chronic liver disease (p276) and evidence of decompensation (jaundice, ascites). Feel for an abdominal mass. Listen for a bruit over the liver (HCC).

## Tests
**Blood:** FBC, clotting, LFT, hepatitis serology, α-fetoprotein (↑ in 50-80% of HCC, though levels do not correlate with size, stage, or prognosis). **Imaging:** US or CT to identify lesions and guide biopsy. MRI is better at distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Do ERCP (p742) and biopsy if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. **Liver biopsy:** (See p248.) May achieve a histological diagnosis; ▶careful multidisciplinary discussion is required if potentially resectable, as bleeding or seeding along the biopsy tract can occur. If the lesion could be a metastasis, find the primary, eg by CXR, mammography, colonoscopy, CT, MRI, or marrow biopsy.

## Liver metastases
Signify advanced disease. Treatment and prognosis vary with the type and extent of primary tumour. Chemotherapy may be effective (eg lymphomas, germ cell tumours). Small, solitary metastases may be amenable to resection (eg colorectal cancer). In most, treatment is palliative. **Prognosis:** Often <6 months.

## Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Primary hepatocyte neoplasia accounts for 90% of primary liver cancers; it is common in China & Africa (40% of cancers vs 2% in UK).
**The patient:** Fatigue, ↓appetite, RUQ pain, ↓weight, jaundice, ascites, haemobilia.34 ♂:♀≈3.
**Causes:** HBV is the leading cause worldwide (esp. if high viral load; p278). HCV;35 AIH (p284); cirrhosis (alcohol, haemochromatosis, PBC); non-alcoholic fatty liver; aflatoxin; Clonorchis sinensis; anabolic steroids.
**∆:** 3-phase CT (delayed wash-out of contrast in a suspect mass); MRI; biopsy.
**Treatment:** Resecting solitary tumours <3cm across ↑ 3yr survival from 13% to 59%; but ~50% have recurrence by 3yrs.36 Liver transplant gives a 5yr survival rate of 70%.37 Percutaneous ablation, tumour embolization (TACE38), and sorafenib are options.
**Prevention:** ▶HBV vaccination (BOX and table 6.15). ▶Don't reuse needles. ▶Screen blood. ▶↓Aflatoxin exposure (sun-dry maize). AFP ± ultrasound (eg 6-monthly screen): Consider if at ↑ risk: eg all with cirrhosis; or chronic HBV in Africans or older Asians.

## Cholangiocarcinoma
(Biliary tree cancer.) ~10% of liver primaries. **Causes:** Flukes (Clonorchis, p435); PSC (screening by CA19-9 may be helpful, p282); biliary cysts; Caroli's disease, p272; HBV; HCV; DM; N-nitroso toxins.
**The patient:** Fever, abdominal pain (± ascites), malaise, ↑bilirubin; ↑ALP.
**Pathology:** Usually slow-growing. Most are distal extrahepatic or perihilar.
**Management:** 70% inoperable at presentation. Of those that are, 76% recur. **Surgery:** eg major hepatectomy + extrahepatic bile duct excision + caudate lobe resection. 5yr survival ~30%. Post-op complications include liver failure, bile leak, and GI bleeding. Stenting of obstructed extrahepatic biliary tree, percutaneously or via ERCP (p742), improves quality of life. Liver transplantation rarely possible. **Prognosis:** ~5 months.

## Benign tumours
**Haemangiomas:** The commonest benign liver tumours. They are often an incidental finding on ultrasound or CT and don't require treatment. Avoid biopsy! **Adenomas:** Common. Causes: anabolic steroids, oral contraceptive pill; pregnancy. Only treat if symptomatic, or >5cm.

34 Haemobilia is late in HCC. Think of bleeding into the biliary tree whenever Quincke's triad obtains: RUQ pain, upper GI haemorrhage, and jaundice. It may be life-threatening.

35 5yr cumulative risk if cirrhosis is present is 30% in Japan and 17% in USA.

36 Operative mortality: 1.6%. Recurrence is more likely if histology showed neoplastic emboli in small vessels. Get early warning of recurrence by arranging imaging, eg if AFP >5.45mcg/L (esp. if trend is rising). Fibrolamellar HCC, which occurs in children and young adults, has a better prognosis.

37 Milan criteria for liver transplantation in HCC: 1 nodule <5cm or 2-3 nodules <3cm.

38 TACE=transarterial chemoembolization, eg with drug-eluting beads; it causes fever and abdo pain in 50%.
