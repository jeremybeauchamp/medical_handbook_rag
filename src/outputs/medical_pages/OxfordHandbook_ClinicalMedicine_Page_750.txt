# 736 Ultrasound (US)

Unlike the other methods of imaging, US doesn't use electromagnetic radiation. Instead, it relies on properties of longitudinal sound waves. This has made it a popular and safe form of imaging with increasingly widespread applications. High-frequency sound waves (3-15MHz) are generated in the transducer (transmitter and receiver) by the vibrations of a piezo-electric quartz crystal as a voltage is applied. Passage of sound waves through tissue is affected by attenuation and reflection. Attenuation disperses waves out of the receiver's range, but it is the waves reflected back to the transducer that determine the image. Its quality depends on the difference in acoustic impedance between adjacent soft tissues.

## Processing
With the help of software a real-time 2D image is made. During processing, an average attenuation value is assumed throughout the tissue examined, so if a higher-than-average attenuation structure is in the superficial tissues (eg fibrous tissue, calcification, or gas), then everything deep to it will be in a low intensity (black) acoustic shadow. If a lower-than-average attenuation object (eg fluid-filled/ cystic structure) is in the superficial tissues then everything deep to it will be high intensity (white) or enhanced. If a tissue interface is strongly disparate, eg gas in the intestine, then all the waves are reflected back, making it impossible to image beyond it. See also figs 16.21-16.24.

## Modes
B: (Brightness) is the most common, giving 2D slices that map the different magnitudes of echo in greyscale. M: (Movement) traces the movement of structures within the line of the sound beam. It is used in imaging, eg heart valves (p110).

## Duplex ultrasonography (flow and morphology)
By combining Doppler effects (shifts in wavelength caused by movement of a source or reflecting surface) with B-mode ultrasound technology, flow characteristics of blood can be inferred (fig 16.21). This is extremely useful in arterial and venous studies, and echocardiography.

## Advantages
Portable; fast; non-ionizing; cheap; real-time; can be used with intervention; can enter organs, eg rectum, vagina, bowel. Endoscopic US can be used to stage and biopsy lung and GI tract cancers, eg stomach, pancreas, and also image the heart = transoesophageal echocardiogram or TOE, p110.

## Disadvantages
Operator dependent—interoperator variability high; poor quality if patient is obese; interference from bone, bowel gas, calculi, or superimposed organs can limit depth and quality of imaging.
