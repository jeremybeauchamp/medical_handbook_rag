# Blackout history

It is vital to establish exactly what patients mean by 'blackout': loss of consciousness?—a fall to the ground without loss of consciousness?—vertigo or visual disturbance? Talk to the patient and witnesses and let them tell you as much as possible without prompting or leading. Ask:

- Does the patient lose awareness?
- Does the patient injure themselves?
- Does the patient move? Are they stiff or floppy? (A tonic phase preceding clonic jerking points towards epilepsy.)
- Is there incontinence? (More common in epilepsy, but can occur with syncope.)
- Does their complexion change? (Pale/cyanosis suggests epilepsy; very pale/white suggests syncope or arrhythmia.)
- Does the patient bite the side of their tongue? (Suggests epilepsy.)
- Are there associated symptoms eg palpitations, sweats, pallor, chest pain, dyspnoea (see fig 10.11)?
- How long does the attack last?

## Before the attack:
- Is there any warning?—Eg typical epileptic aura or cardiac pre-syncope.
- In what circumstances do attacks occur? (If watching TV, consider epilepsy).
- Can the patient prevent attacks?

## After the attack:
- How much does the patient remember about the attack?
- Is there muscle ache? (Suggests a tonic–clonic seizure.)
- Is the patient confused or sleepy? (Suggests epilepsy.)

## Background to attacks:
- When did they start?
- Are they getting more frequent?
- Is anyone else in the family getting them? Sudden arrhythmic death may leave no evidence at postmortem, or there may be hereditary cardiomyopathy (refer those with a relative who has had a sudden unexplained death <40yrs old).
