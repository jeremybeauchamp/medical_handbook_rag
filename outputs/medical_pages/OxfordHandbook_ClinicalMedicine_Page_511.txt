| Sensory: | GI: Swallowing disorders; constipation. |
| • Dysaesthesia | Eye: Diplopia; hemianopia; optic neuritis; visual |
| • Pins and needles | phenomena (eg on exercise); bilateral internuclear |
| • Vibration sense | ophthalmoplegia (p73); pupil defects. |
| • Trigeminal neuralgia | |
| Motor: | Cerebellum: Trunk and limb ataxia; intention |
| • Spastic weakness | tremor; scanning (ie monotonous) speech; falls. |

NB T°, malaise, nausea, vomiting, positional vertigo, seizures, aphasia, meningism, bilateral optic neuritis, CSF leucocytosis and CSF protein are rare in MS, and may suggest non-MS recurrent demyelinating disease, eg vasculitis or sarcoidosis.

## Diagnostic criteria for MS

| Table 10.9 McDonald criteria for diagnosing MS (2010) |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| Clinical presentation | Additional evidence needed for diagnosis |
| ≥2 attacks (relapses) with ≥2 objective clinical lesions | None |
| ≥2 attacks with 1 objective clinical lesion | • MRI: spatially disseminated lesions, or • +ve CSF and ≥2 MRI lesions, or • 2nd attack at a new site |
| 1 attack with ≥2 objective clinical lesions | Dissemination in time: • new lesion on repeat MRI after >3 months or • 2nd attack |
| 1 attack with 1 objective clinical lesion (monosymptomatic presentation) | Dissemination in space: • MRI or +ve CSF if ≥2 MRI lesions consistent with MS • and dissemination in time (by MRI or a 2nd clinical attack) |
| Insidious neurological progression suggestive of primary progressive MS | +ve CSF and dissemination in space on MRI/VEP or continued progression for ≥1yr |

▶A careful history may reveal past episodes, eg brief unexplained visual loss, and detailed examination may show more than 1 lesion.
Attacks must last >1h, with >30d between attacks.

## Six MS eponyms

Devic's syndrome: (=Neuromyelitis optica, NMO.) MS variant with transverse myelitis, (loss of motor, sensory, autonomic, reflex, and sphincter function below the level of a lesion), optic atrophy, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (p698).

Lhermitte's sign: Neck flexion causes 'electric shocks' in trunk/limbs. (Also +ve in cervical spondylosis, cord tumours and B12.)

Uhthoff's phenomenon: Worsening of symptoms with heat, eg in bath.

Charles Bonnet syndrome: (Rare.) Acuity/temporary blindness ± complex visual hallucinations of faces, as well as animals, plants, and trees.

Pulfrich effect: Unequal eye latencies, causing disorientation in traffic as straight trajectories seem curved and distances are misjudged on looking sideways.

Argyll Robertson pupil: See p72.
