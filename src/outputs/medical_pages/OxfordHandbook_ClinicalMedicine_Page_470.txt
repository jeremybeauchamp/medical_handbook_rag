# 456 Headache

Every day, thousands of people visit the doctor complaining of headache. Tension headaches are the most common, but beware the disabling and treatable (migraine, cluster headache), and the sinister (space-occupying lesions, meningitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage). A good history is the key. Ask about:

## Onset
Rapid onset headaches are concerning; the key diagnosis to rule out here is *subarachnoid haemorrhage* (SAH, p478), sudden-onset, 'worst ever' headache, often occipital, stiff neck, focal signs, ±consciousness. Other differentials include:
- *Meningitis* (p822): fever, photophobia, stiff neck, purpuric rash, coma. May be associated with neck stiffness (≈ meningeal irritation). Do an LP, start antibiotics.
- *Encephalitis* (p824): fever, odd behaviour, fits, or reduced consciousness. Do an urgent CT head and LP to look for signs of infection. *Post-coital headache*.

Subacute/gradual onset headaches: *Venous sinus thrombosis* (p480): subacute headache, papilloedema. *Sinusitis*: dull, constant ache over frontal or maxillary sinuses, with tenderness ± postnasal drip. Pain is worse on bending over. Ethmoid or sphenoid sinus pain is felt deep in the midline at the root of the nose. Common with coryza (p406). The pain lasts ~1-2 wks. CT can confirm diagnosis but is rarely needed. *Tropical illness*: eg malaria: travel history, flu-like illness (p416); typhus (p415). *Intracranial hypotension*: CSF leakage, eg iatrogenic after LP or epidural anaesthesia. Suspect if headaches worse on standing; treat with epidural blood patch over leak, if conservative management with IV fluids and caffeine fails.

## Character
Tight band? Think tension headache (the usual cause of bilateral, non-pulsatile headache ± scalp muscle tenderness). Throbbing/pulsatile/lateralizing? Think migraine (p458).

## Frequency
Headaches that recur tend to be benign: 
- *Migraine*: p458. 
- *Cluster headache*: (see BOX 'Cluster headache') 
- *Trigeminal neuralgia*: (see BOX 'Trigeminal neuralgia') 
- *Recurrent (Mollaret's) meningitis*: suspect if fever/meningism with each headache. Send CSF for herpes simplex PCR (HSV2). Is there access to subarachnoid spaces via a skull fracture, or a recurring cause of aseptic meningitis (SLE, eg abducens nerve palsy, Behçet's, sarcoid)?

## Duration
Chronic, progressive headaches can indicate ↑ICP. Typically worse on waking, lying, bending forward, or coughing. Also: vomiting, papilloedema, seizures, false localizing signs, or odd behaviour. Do imaging to exclude a space-occupying lesion, and consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. ►LP is contraindicated until after imaging.

## Associated features
*Eye pain ± reduced vision*: Think acute glaucoma. Typically elderly, long-sighted people. Constant pain develops rapidly around one eye, radiating to the forehead with markedly reduced vision, visual haloes, and a red, congested eye (p561). ►Seek expert help at once. If delay in treatment of >1h is likely, give eye drops (eg 0.5% timolol maleate ± 2% pilocarpine) and acetazolamide 500mg PO. *Jaw claudication tender with thickened, pulseless temporal arteries*: Giant cell arteritis: (p556) Subacute-onset headache with ESR >40mm/h. ►Exclude in all >50yrs old with a headache that has lasted a few weeks: prompt diagnosis and steroids avoid blindness.

## Precipitating causes
*Head trauma*: Commonly causes localized pain but can be more generalized. It lasts ~2wks; often resistant to analgesia. Do CT to exclude subdural or extradural haemorrhage if drowsiness ± lucid interval, or focal signs (p482). *Also ask about*: Analgesia, sex, food (eg chocolate, cheese, coffee).

## Red flags
See p780.

## Drug history
Exclude medication overuse (analgesic rebound) headache: Culprits are mixed analgesics (paracetamol+codeine/opiates), ergotamine, and triptans. This is a common reason for episodic headache becoming chronic daily headache. Analgesia must be withdrawn—aspirin or naproxen may mollify the rebound headache. A preventive may help once off other drugs (eg tricyclics, valproate, gabapentin; p504). Limit use of over-the-counter analgesia (no more than 6d per month).

## Social history
Ask about stress or recent life events; may not explain the pathology, but will help you appreciate the context in which symptoms are experienced.
