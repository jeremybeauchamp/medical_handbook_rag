## Table 13.20 Managing detrusor overactivity in urge incontinence

| Agents for detrusor overactivity | Notes |
|----------------------------------|-------|
| Antimuscarinics: eg tolterodine SR 4mg/24h; SE: dry mouth, eyes/skin, drowsiness, constipation, tachycardia, abdominal pain, urinary retention, sinusitis, oedema, ↑weight, glaucoma precipitation. Up to 4mg/12h may be needed (unlicensed). | Improves frequency & urgency. Alternatives: solifenacin 5mg/24h (max 10mg); oxybutynin, but more SE unless transdermal route or modified release used; trospium or fesoterodine (prefers M3 receptors). Avoid in myasthenia, and if glaucoma or UC are uncontrolled. |
| Topical oestrogens | Post-menopausal urgency, frequency + nocturia may occasionally be improved by raising the bladder's sensory threshold. Systemic therapy worsens incontinence. |
| β3 adrenergic agonist: mirabegron 50mg/24h; SE tachycardia; CI: severe HTN; Caution if renal/hepatic impairment. | Consider if antimuscarinics are contraindicated or clinically ineffective, or if SE unacceptable. |
| Intravesical botulinum toxin (Botox®) | Consider if above medications ineffective. |
| Percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). (A typical treatment consists of ≈12 weekly 30 min sessions.) | Consider if drug treatment ineffective and Botox® not wanted. PTNS delivers neuromodulation to the S2-S4 junction of the sacral nerve plexus. |
| Neuromodulation via transcutaneous electrical stimulation | Sacral nerve stimulation inhibits the reflex behaviour of involuntary detrusor contractions. |
| Modulation of afferent input from bladder | Gabapentin (unlicensed). |
| Hypnosis, psychotherapy, bladder training* | (These all require good motivation.) |
| Surgery (eg clam ileocystoplasty) | Reserved for troublesome or intractable symptoms. The bladder is bisected, opened like a clam, and 25cm of ileum is sewn in. |

NB: desmopressin nasal spray 20mcg nocte reduces urine production and ↓ nocturia in overactive bladder. Unsuitable if elderly (SE: fluid retention, heart failure, ↓Na+).

*Mind over bladder: •Void when you DON'T have urge; DON'T go to the bathroom when you do have urge. •Gradually extend the time between voiding. •Schedule your trips to toilet. •Stretch your bladder to normal capacity. • When urge comes, calm down and make it go using mind over bladder tricks.

## Not all male urinary symptoms are prostate-related!

**Detrusor overactivity** Men get this as well as women. Pressure-flow studies help diagnose this (as does detrusor thickness ≥2.9mm on US).

**Primary bladder neck obstruction** A condition in which the bladder neck does not open properly during voiding. Studies in men and women with voiding dysfunction show that it is common. The cause may be muscular or neurological dysfunction or fibrosis. Diagnosis: Video-urodynamics, with simultaneous pressure-flow measurement, and visualization of the bladder neck during voiding. Treatment: Watchful waiting; α-blockers (p642); surgery.

**Urethral stricture** This may follow trauma or infection (eg gonorrhoea)—and frequently leads to voiding symptoms, UTI, or retention. Malignancy is a rare cause. Imaging: Retrograde urethrogram or antegrade cystourethrogram if the patient has an existing suprapubic catheter. Internal urethrotomy involves incising the stricture transurethrally using endoscopic equipment—to release scar tissue. Stents incorporate themselves into the wall of the urethra and keep the lumen open. They work best for short strictures in the bulbar urethra (anterior urethral anatomy, from proximal to distal: prostatic urethra→posterior or membranous urethra→bulbar urethra→penile or pendulous urethra→fossa navicularis→meatus).
