# Drawing family trees to reveal dominantly inherited disease

Advances in genetics are touching all branches of medicine. It is increasingly important for doctors to identify patients at high risk of genetic disease, and to make appropriate referrals. The key skill is drawing a family tree to help you structure a family history as follows:

1. Start with your patient. Draw a square for a male and a circle for a female. Add a small arrow (see fig 2.2) to show that this person is the propositus (the person through whom the family tree is ascertained).

2. Add your patient's parents, brothers, and sisters. Record basic information only, eg age, and if alive and well (a&w). If dead, note age and cause of death, and pass an oblique stroke through that person's symbol.

3. Ask the key question 'Has anybody else in your family had a similar problem as yourself?', eg heart attack/angina/stroke/cancer. Ask only about the family of diseases that relate to your patient's main problem. Do not record a potted medical history for each family member: time is too short.

4. Extend the family tree upwards to include grandparents. If you haven't revealed a problem by now, go no further—you are unlikely to miss important familial disease. If your patient is elderly it may be impossible to obtain good information about grandparents. If so, fill out the family tree with your patient's uncles and aunts on both the mother's and father's sides.

5. Shade those in the family tree affected by the disease. • = an affected female; ■ = an affected male. This helps to show any genetic problem and, if there is one, will help demonstrate the pattern of inheritance.

6. If you have identified a familial susceptibility, or your patient has a recognized genetic disease, extend the family tree down to include children, to identify others who may be at risk and who may benefit from screening. You should find out who is pregnant in the family, or may soon be, and arrange appropriate genetic counselling (OHCS p154). Refer for genetics opinion.

The family tree (fig 2.2) shows these ideas at work and indicates that there is evidence for genetic risk of colon cancer, meriting referral to a geneticist. N.B: use a different approach in paediatrics, and for autosomal or sex-linked disease. Ask if parents are related (consanguinity risk of recessive diseases).
