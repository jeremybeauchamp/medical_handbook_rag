# Lumps in the neck

> Don't biopsy lumps until tumours within the head and neck have been excluded by an ENT surgeon. Culture all biopsied lymph nodes for TB.

## Diagnosis 
(See fig 13.19.) First, ask how long the lump has been present. If <3wks, self-limiting infection is the likely cause and extensive investigation is unwise. Next ask yourself where the lump is. Is it intradermal—eg sebaceous cyst with a central punctum (p594)? Is it a lipoma (p594)? If the lump is not intradermal, and is not of recent onset, you are about to start a diagnostic hunt over complicated terrain. 85% of neck swellings are lymph nodes (examine areas which they serve). Consider TB, viruses such as HIV or EBV (infectious mononucleosis), any chronic infection, or, if >20yrs, consider lymphoma (hepatosplenomegaly?) or metastases (eg from GI or bronchial or head and neck neoplasia), 8% are goitres (p600), and other diagnoses account for 7%.

## Tests 
Do virology and TB tests (p394). US shows lump consistency: cystic, solid, complex, vascular. CT defines masses in relation to their anatomical neighbours. CXR may show malignancy or, in sarcoid, reveal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Consider fine-needle aspiration (FNA).

## Midline lumps 
- If patient is <20yrs old, likely diagnosis is dermoid cyst (p594). 
- If it moves up on tongue protrusion and is below the hyoid, likely to be a thyroglossal cyst, a fluid-filled sac resulting from incomplete closure of the thyroid's migration path. ℞: Surgery; they are the commonest congenital cervical cystic lump. 
- If >20yrs old, it is probably a thyroid isthmus mass. 
- If it is bony hard, the diagnosis may be a chondroma (benign cartilaginous tumour).

## Submandibular triangle 
(Bordered by the mental process, mandible, and the line between the two angles of the mandible.) 
- If <20yrs, self-limiting lymphadenopathy is likely. If >20yrs, exclude malignant lymphadenopathy (eg firm and non-tender). 
> Is TB likely? 
- If it is not a node, think of submandibular salivary stone, sialadenitis, or tumour (see BOX for Salivary gland pathology).

## Anterior triangle 
(Between midline, anterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and the line between the two angles of the mandible.) 
- Branchial cysts emerge under the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid where the upper third meets the middle third (age <20yrs). Due to non-disappearance of the cervical sinus (where 2nd branchial arch grows down over 3rd and 4th). Lined by squamous epithelium, their fluid contains cholesterol crystals. Treat by excision. There may be communication with the pharynx in the form of a fistula. 
- If lump in the supero-posterior area of the anterior triangle, is it a parotid tumour (more likely if >40yrs)? 
- Laryngoceles are an uncommon cause of anterior triangle lumps. They are painless and may be made worse by blowing. These cysts are classified as external, internal, or mixed, and may be associated with laryngeal cancer. If pulsatile may be: 
  - Carotid artery aneurysm, 
  - Tortuous carotid artery, or 
  - Carotid body tumours (chemodectoma). These are very rare, move from side to side but not up and down, and splay out the carotid bifurcation. They are usually firm and occasionally soft and pulsatile. They do not usually cause bruits. They may be bilateral, familial, and malignant (5%). Suspect in any mass just anterior to the upper third of sternomastoid. Diagnose by duplex USS (splaying at the carotid bifurcation) or digital computer angiography. ℞: Extirpation by vascular surgeon.

## Posterior triangle 
(Behind sternocleidomastoid, in front of trapezius, above clavicle.) 
- Cervical ribs may intrude into this area. These are enlarged costal elements from C7 vertebra. The majority are asymptomatic but can cause Raynaud's syndrome by compressing subclavian artery and neurological symptoms (eg wasting of 1st dorsal interosseous) from pressure on lower trunk of the brachial plexus. 
- Pharyngeal pouches can protrude into the posterior triangle on swallowing (usually left-sided). 
- Cystic hygromas (usually infants) arise from jugular lymph sac. These macrocystic lymphatic malformations transilluminate brightly. Treat by surgery or hypertonic saline sclerosant injection. Recurrence can be troublesome. 
- Pancoast's tumour (see p708). 
- Subclavian artery aneurysm will be pulsatile.
