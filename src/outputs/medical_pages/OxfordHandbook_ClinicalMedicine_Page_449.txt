# Echinococcosis (hydatid disease)

Zoonotic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Clinically important disease forms in humans are:

- Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease, hydatosis): E. granulosus. Found worldwide. Usual host is dog. Also goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels, yaks.
- Alveolar echinococcosis: E. multilocularis. Found in northern hemisphere. Usual hosts are foxes and rodents.

Human ingest parasite eggs via food/water contaminated by animal faeces, or by handing animals which are infected with the tapeworm. Disease is due to the development of cyst-like larvae in viscera, usually liver/lungs. Presentation: Slow growing cysts may be asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms and signs depends on location:

- Liver: abdominal pain, nausea, hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, PUO.
- Lung: dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis.
- CNS: space-occupying signs.
- Bone: an interesting osteolytic cause of knee pain, cord compression.
- Silent disease in breast, kidney, adrenals, bladder, heart, psoas.

Diagnosis: USS/CT/MRI: avascular fluid-filled cysts ± calcification (∆∆ benign cyst, TB, mycoses, abscess, neoplasm). Serology. Positive echinococcal antigen. Treatment: Get help (including surgical). Depends on cyst type, location, size, and complications. Prolonged treatment (months/years) with albendazole. PAIR: Puncture, Aspirate, Inject (hypertonic saline/chemicals), Reaspirate. Beware spillage of cyst contents: praziquantel can be given peri-operatively.

## Fasciola hepatica (common liver fluke)

Parasitic infection. ~2 million infected worldwide. Highest rates of infection in Bolivia and Peru. Infective larvae develop in aquatic snail hosts. Humans infected via contaminated water, waterplants eg watercress, or by eating the undercooked liver of another host animal eg sheep, goat. Disease caused by migration of parasite to bile ducts. Presentation: Acute phase with migration from intestine through liver (2-4 months): abdominal pain, nausea, fever, urticarial rash, eosinophilia. Chronic phase with egg production in the bile ducts: cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis. Diagnosis: Serology in acute and chronic phase. Ova in stool/bile aspirate only in chronic phase. Treatment: Triclabendazole as a single dose. Treat all suspected cases in endemic areas.

## Other liver flukes: opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis

Opisthorchis and clonorchis are liver flukes acquired by eating contaminated fish, mainly in south-east Asia. Adult worms lodge in the small bile ducts and gallbladder. Presentation: Abdominal pain, GI disturbance, cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma. Diagnosis: Ova in stool. Treatment: Praziquantel.

## Tropical liver disease

An overview of the differential diagnosis of tropical/imported liver disease is shown in table 9.28.

| Presentation | Differential diagnosis |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Jaundice/hepatitis | Viral hepatitis, brucellosis, dengue, enteric fever, HIV, leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsial infection, sepsis, TB, viral haemorrhagic fever, yellow fever |
| Hepatomegaly | Amoebic/pyogenic liver abscess, echinococcosis, liver fluke, carcinoma |
| Massive hepatomegaly | Visceral leishmaniasis, tropical lymphoma, late-stage schistosomiasis |
| Fibrosis/cirrhosis | Chronic hepatitis, schistosomiasis, alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease |

Consider liver toxicity: ackee fruit (Jamaica), aflatoxins (peanuts, corn, tropical countries without monitoring/regulation), death cap mushroom, iron, bush tea, methanol, copper, paraquat, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (herbal remedies).
