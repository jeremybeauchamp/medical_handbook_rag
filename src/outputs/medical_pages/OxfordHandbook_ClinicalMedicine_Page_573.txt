## Risk factors: yellow flags

Psychosocial risk factors for developing persisting chronic pain and long-term disability have been termed 'yellow flags':

- Belief that pain and activity are harmful.
- Sickness behaviours such as extended rest.
- Social withdrawal.
- Emotional problems such as low mood, anxiety, or stress.
- Problems or dissatisfaction at work.
- Problems with claims for compensation or time off work.
- Overprotective family or lack of support.
- Inappropriate expectations of treatment, eg low active participation in treatment.

## An existential approach to difficult symptoms

The manner in which management is discussed is almost as important as the management itself, which should focus on education of the patient and their family and on developing coping strategies. Such a diagnosis may be a relief or a disappointment to the patient. Explain that fibromyalgia is a relapsing and remitting condition, with no easy cures, and that they will continue to have good and bad days. Reassure them that there is no serious underlying pathology, that their joints are not being damaged, and that no further tests are necessary, but be sympathetic to the fact that they may have been seeking a physical cause for their symptoms.

We all at some stage come across a patient with difficult symptoms and an exasperating lack of pathology to explain them. Investigations are all normal, and medications do not seem to work. It is tempting to dismiss such patients as malingerers, but often this conclusion comes from the clinician approaching the problem from the wrong angle. The patient has symptoms that are real and disabling to them, and that will not improve without help. Perhaps a more pragmatic approach is to take advice from the Danish philosopher Kierkegaard who wrote to a friend in 1835, 'What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know ... The thing is to understand myself ... to find a truth which is true for me.' Listen to the patient and accept their story. Then help them to focus on what they can do to improve their situation, and to move away from dwelling on finding a physical answer to their symptoms.

## Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia

The current hypothesis is that fibromyalgia is caused by aberrant peripheral and central pain processing. Two key features of the condition are allodynia (pain in response to a non-painful stimulus) and hyperaesthesia (exaggerated perception of pain in response to a mildly painful stimulus), examined for by palpation of tender points. Research is beginning to suggest that certain antidepressants can relieve pain and other symptoms, and especially those that have both serotonergic and noradrenergic activity (tricyclics and venlafaxine). Those acting on serotonergic receptors only are less effective. There is also some evidence to support the use of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and spa therapies, which have been postulated to act through similar spinal pain-modulatory pathways. Thus far, trials have involved relatively small numbers of patients or short time periods, and lack the power to draw strong conclusions. However, it is interesting to note that the CSF of patients with fibromyalgia appears to have increased levels of substance P, while levels of noradrenaline and serotonin metabolites are decreased. All three are neurotransmitters involved in descending pain-modulatory pathways in the spinal cord. Evidence from PET imaging suggests that patients with fibromyalgia may have an abnormal central dopamine response to pain. The critical question is: is this cause or effect?
