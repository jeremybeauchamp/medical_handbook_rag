# Cataplexy is highly specific for narcolepsy/Gélineau's syndrome

Daytime sleepiness has many causes, but if it occurs with cataplexy the diagnosis 'must' be narcolepsy. Cataplexy is bilateral loss of tone in antigravity muscles provoked by emotions such as laughter, startle, excitement, or anger. Associated phenomena include: falls, mouth opening, dysarthria, mutism, and phasic muscle jerking around the mouth. Most attacks are brief, but injury can occur (eg if several attacks per day). It is comparable to the atonia of rapid eye movement sleep but without loss of awareness. 

Δ∆: bradycardia, migraine, atonic/akinetic epilepsy, delayed sleep phase syndrome, conversion disorder, malingering, and psychosis.

Don't confuse cataplexy with catalepsy—a waxy flexibility where involuntary statue-like postures are effortlessly maintained (frozen) despite looking most uncomfortable.
