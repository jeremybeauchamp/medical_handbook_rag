# Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN types 1, 2a, and 2b) 223

In MEN syndromes there are functioning hormone-producing tumours in multiple organs (they are inherited as autosomal dominants).20 They comprise: •MEN-1 and 2 •Neurofibromatosis (p514) •Von Hippel–Lindau and Peutz–Jeghers syndromes (p712 & p708) •Carney complex (spotty skin pigmentation, schwannomas, myxoma of skin, mucosa, or heart, especially atrial myxoma), and endocrine tumours: eg pituitary adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and testicular tumour.

## MEN-1:
• Parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma (~95%; most ↑Ca2+).
• Pancreas endocrine tumours (70%)—gastrinoma (p716) or insulinoma (p215), or, rarely, somatostatinoma (DM + steatorrhoea + gallstones/cholangitis), VIPoma (p258), or glucagonomas (±glucagon syndrome: migrating rash; glossitis; cheilitis, fig 8.5 p327; anaemia; ↓weight; ↑plasma glucagon; ↑glucose).
• Pituitary prolactinoma (~50%) or GH secreting tumour (acromegaly:21 p239); also, adrenal and carcinoid tumours are associated.

The MEN-1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene. Menin, its protein, alters transcription activation. Many are sporadic, presenting in the 3rd–5th decades.

## MEN-2a:
• Thyroid: medullary thyroid carcinoma (seen in ~100%, p600).
• Adrenal: phaeochromocytoma (~50%, usually benign and bilateral).
• Parathyroid hyperplasia (~80%, but less than 20% have ↑Ca2+).

## MEN-2b: 
Has similar features to MEN-2a plus mucosal neuromas and Marfanoid appearance (p706), but no hyperparathyroidism. Mucosal neuromas consist of 'bumps' on: lips, cheeks, tongue, glottis, eyelids, and visible corneal nerves.

The gene involved in MEN-2a and b is the ret proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Tests for ret mutations are revolutionizing MEN-2 treatment by enabling a prophylactic thyroidectomy to be done before neoplasia occurs, usually before 3yrs of age. NB: ret mutations rarely contribute to sporadic parathyroid tumours.

# Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes

Autoimmune disorders cluster into two defined syndromes:

## Type 1 
Autosomal recessive, rare.
Cause: Mutations of AIRE (Auto ImmuneREgulator) gene on chromosome 21.
Features: •Addison's disease. •Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. •Hypoparathyroidism. Also associated with hypogonadism, pernicious anaemia, autoimmune primary hypothyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, alopecia.

## Type 2 
HLA D3 and D4 linked, common. Cause: Polygenic.
Features: •Addison's disease. •Type 1 diabetes mellitus (in 20%).
• Autoimmune thyroid disease—hypothyroidism or Graves' disease.
Also associated with primary hypogonadism, vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anaemia, chronic atrophic gastritis, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis.
