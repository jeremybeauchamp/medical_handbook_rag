## Waterhouse-Friderichsen's (WhF) syndrome
Bilateral adrenal cortex haemorrhage, often occurring in rapidly deteriorating meningococcal sepsis, alongside widespread purpura, meningitis, coma, and DIC (fig 15.22). The meningococcal endotoxin acts as a potent initiator of inflammatory and coagulation cascades. Other causes include H. influenzae, pneumococcal, streptococcal, and staphylococcal sepsis. Adrenal failure causes shock, as normal vascular tone requires cortisol to set activity of α- and β-adrenergic receptors, and aldosterone is needed to maintain extracellular fluid volume. Treatment: Antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (p822) and hydrocortisone 200mg/4h IV for adrenal support. ICU admission.

## Weber's syndrome 
(Superior alternating hemiplegia.) Ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia, due to infarction of one-half of the midbrain, after occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar or posterior cerebral arteries.

## Wegener's granulomatosis 
This has been renamed granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), in part because of concerns over the suitability of Friedrich Wegener, a member of the Nazi party during WWII, to be the source of an eponym. GPA is a multisystem disorder of unknown cause characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and vasculitis of small and medium vessels. It has a predilection for the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. Features: Upper airways disease is common, with nasal obstruction, ulcers, epistaxis, or destruction of the nasal septum causing a characteristic 'saddle-nose' deformity. Sinusitis is often a feature. Renal disease causes rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescent formation, proteinuria, or haematuria. Pulmonary involvement may cause cough, haemoptysis (severe if pulmonary haemorrhage), or pleuritis. There may also be skin purpura or nodules, peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, arthritis/arthralgia, or ocular involvement, eg keratitis, conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, uveitis. Tests: cANCA directed against PR3 is most specific and raised in the majority of patients (p553). Some patients express pANCA specific for MPO. ESR/CRP. Urinalysis should be performed to look for proteinuria or haematuria. If these are present, consider a renal biopsy. CXR may show nodules ± fluffy infiltrates of pulmonary haemorrhage. CT may reveal diffuse alveolar haemorrhage. Atypical cells from cytology of sputum/BAL can be confused with bronchial carcinoma. Treatment: Depends on the extent of disease. Severe disease (eg biopsy-proven renal disease) should be treated with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (or rituximab) to induce remission. Azathioprine and methotrexate are usually used as maintenance. Indications for plasma exchange include patients presenting with severe renal disease (eg creatinine >500μmol/L) and those with pulmonary haemorrhage. Co-trimoxazole should be given as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii and staphylococcal colonization.

## Wernicke's encephalopathy 
Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency with a classical triad of 1 confusion 2 ataxia and 3 ophthalmoplegia (nystagmus, lateral rectus, or conjugate gaze palsies). There is inadequate dietary intake, GI absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine resulting in focal areas of brain damage, including periaqueductal punctate haemorrhages (mechanism unclear). Always consider this diagnosis in alcoholics: it may also present with memory disturbance, hypotension, hypothermia, or reduced consciousness. Recognized causes: Chronic alcoholism, eating disorders, malnutrition, prolonged vomiting, eg with chemotherapy, GI malignancy, or hyperemesis gravidarum. Diagnosis: Primarily clinical. Red cell transketolase activity is decreased (rarely done). Treatment: Urgent replacement to prevent irreversible Korsakoff's syndrome (p704). Give thiamine (Pabrinex®), 2 pairs of high-potency ampoules IV/IM/8h over 30min for 2d, then 1 pair OD for a further 5d. Oral supplementation (100mg OD) should continue until no longer 'at risk' (+ give other B vitamins). Anaphylaxis is rare. If there is coexisting hypoglycaemia (often the case in this group of patients), make sure thiamine is given before glucose, as Wernicke's can be precipitated by glucose administration to a thiamine-deficient patient. Prognosis: Untreated, death occurs in 20%, and Korsakoff's psychosis occurs in 85%—a quarter of whom will require long-term institutional care.
