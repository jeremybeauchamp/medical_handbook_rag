Fig 19.1 Dr Leander Starr Jameson (1853-1917) was a Victorian physician barely known to the history of our profession and yet immortalized by the idealization of his character in Rudyard Kipling's poem 'If'. Kipling's words contain much that might guide the doctor faced with a sudden and unexpected emergency. Beyond the oft quoted exhortation to 'keep your head when all about you are losing theirs', Kipling also endorsed an appropriate degree of self-confidence ('trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too'), encouraged realism ('meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same'), and a large measure of courage ('force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"'). But what of Dr James? As a house officer in London, he broke down from overwork and moved to take up what would become a distinguished practice in South Africa. A foray into the military ill-suited him and he ended up in jail for leading a botched raid that was so out-of-character that it seems he allowed himself to become a scapegoat for others higher in government. He died in November 1917, outliving Kipling's son John, who was killed in the trenches in 1915 at the age of 18, and to whom 'If' was addressed: 'Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son.'
