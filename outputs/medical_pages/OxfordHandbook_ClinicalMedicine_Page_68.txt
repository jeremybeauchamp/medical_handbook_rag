## The respiratory system: important presentations

Some physical signs (fig 2.22).

| Condition | Physical Signs |
|-----------|----------------|
| PLEURAL EFFUSION | - (There may be bronchial breathing at the top of an effusion)<br>- Expansion: ↓<br>- Percussion: ↓ (stony dull)<br>- Air entry: ↓<br>- Vocal resonance: ↓<br>- Trachea + mediastinum central<br>(shift away from affected side only with massive effusions ≥1000mL) |
| CONSOLIDATION | - Expansion ↓<br>- Percussion note ↓<br>- Vocal resonance ↑<br>- Bronchial breathing ±<br>coarse crackles (with<br>whispering pectoriloquy)<br>- Trachea + mediastinum central |
| SPONTANEOUS PNEUMOTHORAX/<br>EXTENSIVE COLLAPSE<br>(±± LOBECTOMY/<br>PNEUMONECTOMY) | - Expansion ↓<br>- Percussion note ↑<br>- Breath sounds ↓<br>- Trachea + mediastinum shift<br>towards the affected side |
| TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX<br>(See fig 16.43, p749 for<br>chest X-ray image) | - Expansion ↓<br>- Percussion note ↑<br>- Breath sounds ↓<br>- Trachea + mediastinum shift<br>away from the affected side |
| FIBROSIS | - Expansion ↓<br>- Percussion note ↓<br>- Breath sounds bronchial<br>± crackles<br>- Trachea + mediastinum<br>central or pulled towards<br>the area of fibrosis |
