# Benign prostatic hyperplasia

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common (24% if aged 40-64; 40% if older).

**Pathology:** Benign nodular or diffuse proliferation of musculofibrous and glandular layers of the prostate. Inner (transitional) zone enlarges in contrast to peripheral layer expansion seen in prostate carcinoma. 

**Features:** Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) = nocturia, frequency, urgency, post-micturition dribbling, poor stream/flow, hesitancy, overflow incontinence, haematuria, bladder stones, UTI. 

**Management:** Assess severity of symptoms and impact on life. PR exam. **Tests:** MSU; U&E; ultrasound (large residual volume, hydronephrosis—fig 13.49), PSA (prior to PR exam; see also BOX 'Advice to asymptomatic men', p645), transrectal US ± biopsy. Then consider:

- **Lifestyle:** Avoid caffeine, alcohol (↑urgency/nocturia). Relax when voiding. Void twice in a row to aid emptying. Control urgency by practising distraction methods (eg breathing exercises). Train the bladder by 'holding on' to ↑ time between voiding.

- **Drugs** are useful in mild disease, and while awaiting surgery. 
  - **α-blockers** are 1st line (eg tamsulosin 400mcg/d PO; also alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin). ↓Smooth muscle tone (prostate and bladder). SE: drowsiness; depression; dizziness; ↓BP; dry mouth; ejaculatory failure; extra-pyramidal signs; nasal congestion; ↑weight.
  - **5α-reductase inhibitors:** can be added, or used alone, eg finasteride 5mg/d PO (↓conversion of testosterone to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone). Excreted in semen, so use condoms; females should avoid handling. SE: impotence; ↓libido. ↓prostate size over 3-6mths and ↓ long-term retention risk.

- **Surgery:**
  - **Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)** ≤14% become impotent (see BOX). Crossmatch 2U. Beware bleeding, clot retention, and post TURP syndrome: absorption of washout causing CNS & CVS disturbance. ~12% need redoing within 8yrs.
  - **Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)** involves less destruction than TURP, and less risk to sexual function, gives similar benefit. Relieves pressure on the urethra. Maybe best surgical option for those with small glands <30g.
  - **Retropubic prostatectomy** is an open operation (if prostate very large).
  - **Transurethral laser-induced prostatectomy (TULIP)** may be as good as TURP.
  - **Robotic prostatectomy** is gaining popularity as a less traumatic and minimally invasive treatment option.

## Advice for patients concerning transurethral prostatectomy (TURP)

**Pre-op consent issues may centre on risks of the procedure, eg:**

| Risks                        | More Risks                         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Haematuria/haemorrhage       | Infection; prostatitis              |
| Haematospermia               | Erectile dysfunction ~10%           |
| Hypothermia                  | Incontinence ≤10%                   |
| Urethral trauma/stricture    | Clot retention near strictures      |
| Post TURP syndrome (↑T°; ↓Na⁺) | Retrograde ejaculation (common)     |

**Post-operative advice**

- Avoid driving for 2wks after the operation.
- Avoid sex for 2wks after surgery. Then get back to normal. The amount ejaculated may be reduced (as it flows backwards into the bladder—harmless, but may cloud the urine). It means you may be infertile. Erections may be a problem after TURP, but do not expect this: in some men, erections improve. Rarely, orgasmic sensations are reduced.
- Expect to pass blood in the urine for the first 2wks. A small amount of blood colours the urine bright red. Do not be alarmed.
- At first you may need to urinate more frequently than before. Do not be despondent. In 6wks things should be much better—but the operation cannot be guaranteed to work (8% fail, and lasting incontinence is a problem in 6%; 12% may need repeat TURPs within 8yrs, compared with 1.8% of men undergoing open prostatectomy).
- If feverish, or if urination hurts, take a sample of urine to your doctor.
