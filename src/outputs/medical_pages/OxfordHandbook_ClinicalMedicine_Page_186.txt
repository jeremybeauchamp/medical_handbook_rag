# Bronchiectasis

## Pathology
Chronic inflammation of the bronchi and bronchioles leading to permanent dilatation and thinning of these airways. Main organisms: H. influenzae; Strep. pneumoniae; Staph. aureus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

## Causes
- Congenital: Cystic fibrosis (CF); Young's syndrome; primary ciliary dyskinesia; Kartagener's syndrome (OHCS p646).
- Post-infection: Measles; pertussis; bronchiolitis; pneumonia; TB; HIV.
- Other: Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body); allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA, p177); hypogammaglobulinaemia; rheumatoid arthritis; ulcerative colitis; idiopathic.

## Clinical features
- Symptoms: Persistent cough; copious purulent sputum; intermittent haemoptysis.
- Signs: Finger clubbing; coarse inspiratory crepitations; wheeze (asthma, COPD, ABPA).
- Complications: Pneumonia, pleural effusion; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; cerebral abscess; amyloidosis.

## Tests
- Sputum culture.
- CXR: Cystic shadows, thickened bronchial walls (tramline and ring shadows); see fig 4.7.
- HRCT chest (p164) to assess extent and distribution of disease.
- Spirometry often shows an obstructive pattern; reversibility should be assessed.
- Bronchoscopy to locate site of haemoptysis, exclude obstruction and obtain samples for culture.
- Other tests: Serum immunoglobulins; CF sweat test; Aspergillus precipitins or skin-prick test RAST and total IgE.

## Management
- Airway clearance techniques and mucolytics. Chest physiotherapy and devices such as a flutter valve may aid sputum expectoration and mucus drainage.
- Antibiotics should be prescribed according to bacterial sensitivities. Patients known to culture Pseudomonas will require either oral ciprofloxacin or suitable IV antibiotics. If â‰¥3 exacerbations a year consider long-term antibiotics (may be nebulized).
- Bronchodilators (eg nebulized salbutamol) may be useful in patients with asthma, COPD, CF, ABPA (p177).
- Corticosteroids (eg prednisolone) and itraconazole for ABPA.
- Surgery may be indicated in localized disease or to control severe haemoptysis.

PA chest radiograph showing marked abnormal dilatation of the airways throughout the right upper lobe, subtle similar changes throughout the rest of the lung (particulalry periphery of the left upper zone). The fine background reticular pattern in the lungs suggests that there may also be some interstitial lung disease present.
