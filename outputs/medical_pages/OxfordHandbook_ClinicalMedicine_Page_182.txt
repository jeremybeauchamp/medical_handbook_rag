## Specific pneumonias

### Pneumococcal pneumonia
The commonest bacterial pneumonia. Affects all ages, but is commoner in the elderly, alcoholics, post-splenectomy, immunosuppressed, and patients with chronic heart failure or pre-existing lung disease. Clinical features: Fever, pleurisy, herpes labialis. CXR shows lobar consolidation. If mod/severe check for urinary antigen. Treatment: amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, or cephalosporin.

### Staphylococcal pneumonia
May complicate influenza infection or occur in the young, elderly, intravenous drug users, or patients with underlying disease, eg leukaemia, lymphoma, cystic fibrosis (CF). It causes a bilateral cavitating bronchopneumonia. Treatment: flucloxacillin ± rifampicin, MRSA: contact lab; consider vancomycin.

### Klebsiella pneumonia
Rare. Occurs in elderly, diabetics, and alcoholics. Causes a cavitating pneumonia, particularly of the upper lobes, often drug resistant. Treatment: cefotaxime or imipenem.

### Pseudomonas
A common pathogen in bronchiectasis and CF. It also causes hospital-acquired infections, particularly on ITU or after surgery. Treatment: anti-pseudomonal penicillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, or ciprofloxacin + aminoglycoside. Consider dual therapy to minimize resistance.

### Mycoplasma pneumoniae
Occurs in epidemics about every 4yrs. It presents insidiously with flu-like symptoms (headache, myalgia, arthralgia) followed by a dry cough. CXR: reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation often of one lower lobe, and worse than signs suggest. Diagnosis: PCR sputum or serology. Cold agglutinins may cause an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications: Skin rash (erythema multiforme, fig 12.22, p563), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, meningoencephalitis or myelitis; Guillain-Barré syndrome. Treatment: Clarithromycin (500mg/12h) or doxycycline (200mg loading then 100mg OD) or a fluroquinolone (eg ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin).

### Legionella pneumophila
Colonizes water tanks kept at <60°C (eg hotel air-conditioning and hot water systems) causing outbreaks. Flu-like symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia) precede a dry cough and dyspnoea. Extra-pulmonary features include anorexia, D&V, hepatitis, renal failure, confusion, and coma. CXR shows bi-basal consolidation. Blood tests may show lymphopenia, hyponatraemia, and deranged LFTs. Urinalysis may show haematuria. Diagnosis: Urine antigen/culture. Treatment: fluoroquinolone for 2-3wks or clarithromycin (p387). 10% mortality.

### Chlamydophila pneumoniae
The commonest chlamydial infection. Person-to-person spread, biphasic illness: pharyngitis, hoarseness, otitis, followed by pneumonia. Diagnosis: Chlamydophila complement fixation test, PCR invasive samples. Treatment: Doxycycline or clarithromycin.

### Chlamydophila psittaci
Causes psittacosis, an ornithosis acquired from infected birds (typically parrots). Symptoms include headache, fever, dry cough, lethargy, arthralgia, anorexia, and D&V. Extra-pulmonary features are legion but rare, eg meningo-encephalitis, infective endocarditis, hepatitis, nephritis, rash, splenomegaly. CXR shows patchy consolidation. Diagnosis: Chlamydophila serology. Treatment: doxycycline or clarithromycin.

### Viral pneumonia
Influenza commonest (p396 and BOX), but 'swine flu' (H1N1) is now considered seasonal and covered by the annual 'flu vaccine. Others: measles, CMV, varicella zoster.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia
Causes pneumonia in the immunosuppressed (eg HIV). The organism responsible was previously called Pneumocystis carinii, and now called Pneumocystis jirovecii. It presents with a dry cough, exertional dyspnoea, ↓PO₂, fever, bilateral crepitations. CXR may be normal or show bilateral perihilar interstitial shadowing. Diagnosis: Visualization of the organism in induced sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, or in a lung biopsy specimen. Drugs: High-dose co-trimoxazole (pp400-1), or pentamidine by slow IVI for 2-3 weeks (p401). Steroids are beneficial if severe hypoxaemia. Prophylaxis is indicated if the CD4 count is <200×10⁶/L or after the 1st attack.
