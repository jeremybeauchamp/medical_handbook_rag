# Number needed to treat

Number needed to treat (NNT) is a useful way of reporting the results of randomized clinical trials. It is the reciprocal of the absolute risk difference: 1 ÷ ARR.

A large treatment effect means that fewer patients need to receive treatment in order for one to benefit. It is specific to the chosen comparator (eg placebo or usual care), the measured outcome (eg death, blood pressure fall), and the duration of treatment follow-up used in the study. Look carefully at the details of the question that the NNT is attempting to quantify.

- Advantages: easily calculated, single numerical value for efficacy, can be used to examine harm (becomes the number needed to harm).
- Disadvantages: confidence intervals are difficult when the differences between treatments are not significant.

## The doctor as a gambler

### Yes or No?
Your tutor asks whether Gobble's disease is commoner in women or men. You have no idea, and make a guess. What is the chance of getting it right? Common sense decrees that you have a 50:50 chance. Sod's law predicts that whatever you guess, you will always be wrong. Somewhere between the two is Damon Runyon's view that 'all life is 6 to 5 against': Will you pick the right answer? Perhaps, but don't bet on it!

### New or existing disease?
Suppose singultus is a rare symptom of Gobble's disease (seen in 5% of patients), but that it is a very common symptom of Kobble's disease (seen in 90%). If we have a man whom we already know has Gobble's disease, who goes on to develop singultus, is it more likely to be due to Kobble's, rather than Gobble's disease? The answer is usually no: it is generally the case that most symptoms are due to a disease that is already known, and do not imply a new disease (Occam's razor, p4). The 'odds ratio' makes this clearer, ie the ratio of [the probability of the symptom, given the known disease] to [the probability of the symptom due to new disease ≈ the probability of developing the new disease]. Usually this is vastly in favour of the symptom being due to the old disease, because of the prior odds of the two diseases. This will work until Kobble's disease increases in prevalence so as to increase the odds of a second disease (then Hickam trumps Occam, p4).

### How to play the odds
It is distasteful to think that doctors can gamble with patients' lives. It is also distasteful to think of serious diseases being 'missed', and invasive procedures being done unnecessarily. Yet we do not have an evidence base or an experience base which can tell us definitively which cough or lethargy or sore toe is just 'one of those things', and which is the result of undiagnosed cancer or HIV or osteomyelitis. And so we gamble.

Medicine is not for pessimists—almost anything can be made to seem fatal, so that a pessimistic doctor would never get any sleep at night due to worry about the meaning of their patients' symptoms. Medicine is not for blind optimists either, who too easily embrace a fool's paradise of false reassurance. Rather, medicine is for informed gamblers: gamblers who are happy to use subtle clues to change their outlook from pessimism to optimism and vice versa. Sometimes the gambling is scientific, rational, methodical, and reproducible (odds ratio); sometimes it instinctual, due to clinical intuition (vital but ill-defined).

Of course, gambling inevitably results in losses, and in medicine the chips are not just financial. They betoken the health of your patient, your reputation, and your confidence. Perhaps the hardest part of medicine is the inevitability of making mistakes whilst attempting to help (see 'Being wrong', p5). But do not worry about gambling: gambling is your job. If you cannot gamble, you cannot walk the thin line between successfully addressing health needs, and causing over-medicalization (p23). But try hard to assemble sufficient evidence to maximize the chances of being lucky. Lucky gambling is a requisite for successful doctoring and the casino of medical practice celebrates the card counter. But the cardinal clinical virtue is courage: without it we would not follow our hunches and take justified risks.
