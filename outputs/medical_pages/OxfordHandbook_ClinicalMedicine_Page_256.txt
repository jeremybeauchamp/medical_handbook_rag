Fig 6.1 Families are rarely what they seem: Otto, Aurelia, and Sylvia seem to be having a nice cup of tea, but Warren (the son and brother) is absent, Otto's leg is missing, Aurelia is beside herself with anxiety, and neither is fully aware of the turmoil spiralling out of control in their unstable daughter, Sylvia. How the gut weaves in and out of our patients' stories is one of gastroenterology's perpetually fascinating and significant riddles. So whenever you are presented with an image in gastroenterology, ask what is missing, and try to work out the forces which are perpetuating or relieving symptoms. This is all very helpful, but it can never be relied on to tame or predict what happens next. So what did happen next? See BOX to find out.
