## Pulses

Assess the radial pulse to determine rate and rhythm. Character and volume are best assessed at the brachial or carotid arteries. A collapsing pulse may also be felt at the radial artery when the patient's arm is elevated above their head. See fig 2.10.

**Rate** Is the pulse fast (≥100bpm, p126) or slow (≤60bpm, p124)?

**Rhythm** An irregularly irregular pulse occurs in AF or multiple ectopics. A regularly irregular pulse occurs in 2° heart block and ventricular bigeminus.

**Character and volume**
- Bounding pulses are caused by CO2 retention, liver failure, and sepsis.
- Small volume pulses occur in aortic stenosis, shock, and pericardial effusion.
- Collapsing ('waterhammer') pulses are caused by aortic incompetence, AV malformations, and a patent ductus arteriosus.
- Anacrotic (slow-rising) pulses occur in aortic stenosis.
- Bisferiens pulses occur in combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation.
- Pulsus alternans (alternating strong and weak beats) suggests LVF, cardiomyopathy, or aortic stenosis.
- Jerky pulses occur in H(O)CM.
- Pulsus paradoxus (systolic pressure weakens in inspiration by >10mmHg) occurs in severe asthma, pericardial constriction, or cardiac tamponade.

**Peripheral pulses** (See p36.) See p771 for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling.

### Waterhammer pulse

The waterhammer was a popular toy that consisted of a vacuum tube half-filled with water. On inversion, the whoosh of water produced an intriguing hammer-blow as it rushed from end to end. This is the alternative name for Corrigan's collapsing pulse—ie one in which the upstroke is abrupt and steep, whose peak is reached early and with abnormal force—before a rapid downstroke (as blood whooshes back into the left ventricle through an incompetent aortic valve).

| Pulse Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| Normal | Standard pulse waveform | - |
| Slow rising | Gradual upstroke | e.g. aortic stenosis |
| Bisferiens | Double-peaked pulse | e.g. aortic stenosis mixed with aortic regurgitation |
| Collapsing | Rapid upstroke and downstroke | e.g. aortic regurgitation |
| None | Flat line | e.g. occluded artery, death |
