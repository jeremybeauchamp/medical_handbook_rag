Fig 8.66 Haematopoiesis and Sod's law. When we contemplate a diagram like this (of seemingly galactic complexity) we, being doctors, think 'What can go wrong?' With a sinking feeling we realize that every arc is an opportunity for multiple disasters. Perhaps, using the Hammer of Los (p322) and our own ingenuity we might occasionally complete these pathways without Sod intervening (Sod's law states that if something can go wrong, it will—here Sod's tubercular breath is seen blowing the red cell line off course—TB is a famous cause of leukoerythroblastic anaemia). When we realize that every day each of us makes 175 billion red cells, 70 billion granulocytes, and 175 billion platelets we sense that Sod is smiling to himself with especial relish. Anything can go wrong. Everything can go wrong. This latter we call aplastic anaemia. Agranulocytosis is when the Southerly arcs go wrong; thrombocytopenia when the West-pointing arcs go wrong. To the East we have the lymphocytes and their B- and T-cell complexities. Anaemia lies in the North of this diagram. And as for bleeding—how could our predecessors bear to waste a single drop of this stuff on purpose? Our minds are reeling at 175 billion red cells per day—but this is just when the system is idling. When we bleed, throughput can rise by an order of magnitude—if Sod is turning a blind eye are there sufficient haematinics (eg iron, B12, and folate) to allow maximum haemopoiesis?
