### 3 Psoriatic arthritis (OHCS p594.)
Occurs in 10-40% with psoriasis and can present before skin changes. Patterns are: 
- symmetrical polyarthritis (like RA) 
- DIP joints
- asymmetrical oligoarthritis 
- spinal (similar to AS) 
- psoriatic arthritis mutilans (rare, ~3%, severe deformity). 

**Radiology:** Erosive changes, with 'pencil-in-cup' deformity in severe cases. Associated with nail changes in 80%, synovitis (dactylitis), acneiform rashes and palmo-plantar pustulosis. 

**Management:** NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, methotrexate. Anti-TNF agents are also effective.

### 4 Reactive arthritis 
A condition in which arthritis and other clinical manifestations occur as an autoimmune response to infection elsewhere in the body— typically GI or GU, although the preceding infection may have resolved or be asymptomatic by the time the arthritis presents. 

**Other clinical features:** Iritis, keratoderma blenorrhagica (brown, raised plaques on soles and palms), circinate balanitis (painless penile ulceration secondary to Chlamydia), mouth ulcers, and enthesitis. Patients may present with a triad of urethritis, arthritis, and conjunctivitis (Reiter's syndrome). 

**Tests:** ESR & CRP. Culture stool if diarrhoea. Infectious serology. Sexual health review. X-ray may show enthesitis with periosteal reaction. 

**Management:** There is no specific cure. Splint affected joints acutely; treat with NSAIDs or local steroid injections. Consider sulfasalazine or methotrexate if symptoms >6 months. Treating the original infection may make little difference to the arthritis.

### HLA-B27 disease associations

The HLA system plays a key role in immunity and self-recognition. More than one hundred HLA B27 disease associations have been made, yet the actual role of HLA B27 in triggering an inflammatory response is not fully understood. ~5% of the UK population are HLA B27 positive—most do not have any disease. The chance of an HLA B27 positive person developing spondyloarthritis or eye disease is 1 in 4.

Common associations include:

| Disease | HLA B27 Positive Percentage |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Ankylosing spondylitis | 85-95% of all those with AS |
| Acute anterior uveitis | 50-60% |
| Reactive arthritis | 60-85% |
| Enteric arthropathy | 50-60% |
| Psoriatic arthritis | 60-70% |

The image shows the progression of disease and effect on posture in severe ankylosing spondylitis. It displays four silhouettes of a person's body profile, dated from 1947 to 1972, showing a gradual increase in spinal curvature and hunched posture over time.
