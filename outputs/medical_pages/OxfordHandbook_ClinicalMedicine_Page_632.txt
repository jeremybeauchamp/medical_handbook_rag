# Carcinoma of the oesophagus

**Incidence** Australia <5/100 000/yr; UK <9; Iran >100. Risk factors: Diet, alcohol excess, smoking, achalasia, reflux oesophagitis ± Barrett's oesophagus (p695); obesity, hot drinks, nitrosamine exposure, Plummer–Vinson syndrome (p250). ♂:♀≈5:1.

**Site** 20% occur in the upper part, 50% in the middle, and 30% in the lower part. They may be squamous cell (proximal) or adenocarcinomas (distal; incidence rising).

**Presentation** Dysphagia; ↓weight; retrosternal chest pain. Signs from the upper third of the oesophagus: Hoarseness; cough (may be paroxysmal if aspiration pneumonia). ΔΔ: See 'Dysphagia', p250.

**Tests** Oesophagoscopy with biopsy is the investigation of choice ± EUS, CT/MRI for staging (fig 13.35), or laparoscopy if significant infra-diaphragmatic component. Staging: See table 13.14.

**Treatment** Survival rates are poor with or without treatment. If localized T1/T2 disease, radical curative oesophagectomy may be tried. Pre-op chemotherapy (cisplatin + fluorouracil) for localized disease may improve survival, but causes some morbidity. If surgery is not indicated, then chemoradiotherapy may be better than radiotherapy alone. Palliation in advanced disease aims to restore swallowing with chemo/radiotherapy, stenting, and laser use.

## TNM staging in oesophageal cancer

Spread of oesophageal cancer is direct, by submucosal infiltration and local spread—or to nodes, or, later, via the blood.

Table 13.14 Oesophageal cancer: TNM staging

| Stage | Description                        | Node Status | Description                |
|-------|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Tis   | Carcinoma in situ                  | Nx        | Nodes cannot be assessed    |
| T1    | Invading lamina propria/submucosa  | N0        | No node spread              |
| T2    | Invading muscularis propria        | N1-N3     | Regional node metastases    |
| T3    | Invading adventitia                | M0        | No distant spread           |
| T4    | Invasion of adjacent structures    | M1        | Distant metastasis          |

Fig 13.35 Axial CT of the chest after IV contrast medium showing concentric thickening of the oesophagus (arrow); the diagnosis here is oesophageal carcinoma. Loss of the fatty plane around the oesophagus suggests local invasion. Anterior to the oesophagus is the trachea and next to it is the arch of the aorta.
