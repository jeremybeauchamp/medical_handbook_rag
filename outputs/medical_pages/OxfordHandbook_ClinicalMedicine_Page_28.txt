# Medical ethics

> 'Our clinical practice is steered by ethical principles. They guide the decisions we make in our clinics and ward rounds, what we tell our patients, and what we omit to tell them.'

In the silences of our consultations it is we who are under the microscope, and we cannot escape our destiny in the sphere of ethics. To give us courage in this enterprise, we can recall the law of the aviator and seagull: it is only by facing the prevailing wind that we can become airborne, and achieve a new vantage point from which to survey our world. We hope for moral perception: to be able to visualize the morally salient features of a situation. For without this, ethical issues may float past never to be resolved. Be alert to words which may carry hidden assumptions: 'futility', 'consent', 'best interests'. Consider WIGWAM in your routine patient review:

- Wishes of the patient: are they known or unknown?
- Issues of confidentiality/disclosure.
- Goals of care: are they clear? Whose are they: yours or the patient's?
- Wants: to decline treatment or discharge against advice.
- Arguments between family/friends/doctors.
- Money: concerns of the patient, concerns of the healthcare provider.

## Ethical frameworks

Offer structure, comprehensiveness, and transparency in deliberation.

### Four principles

**Autonomy:** Self governance: the ability of a patient to make a choice based on their own values and beliefs. **Beneficence:** The obligation to benefit patients. Links with autonomy as benefit is dependent upon the view of the patient. **Non-maleficence:** Do not harm. Or more appropriately, do no overall harm: you should stick a needle into someone when they need dialysis. **Justice:** A collection of obligations including legality, human rights, fairness, and resource distribution.

### Four quadrants method

**Medical indications:** Identify the clinical problem, treatment options, goals of treatment, and likelihood of success. **Patient preferences:** What is the patient's autonomous decision? (And is the patient capable of making one? If not, look for previously expressed wishes from advanced directives, family, friends, GP.) **Quality of life:** How will the proposed treatment affect quality of life? This is subjective: recognize your own biases and accommodate those of the patient. **Contextual factors:** The wider context: legal, cultural, religious, familial, and anything else that may impact.

These frameworks describe individual voices within the ethics choir. Sometimes there is a beautiful harmony, but how should you act when there is discordance? There is no hierarchy within the frameworks. Each component is binding unless it is trumped by a stronger principle. How you weigh up and balance the ethical components of a situation is not easy, but it should be clear and justified. Know the patient. Consult others, especially those who hold different opinions to yourself. Can you adequately defend your decision to the patient? Their family? Your consultant? Another consultant? A lawyer? If an investigative journalist were to sit on a sulcus of yours, having full knowledge of all thoughts and actions, would he be composing vitriol for tomorrow's newspapers? If so, can you answer him, point for point?

## Beyond the ethical framework

To force an ethical problem to fit a framework may be inadequate, reductionistic, and inconsistent. It is potentially biased towards Western culture, discounts the non-autonomous, and is vulnerable to poorly considered emphasis and error. 'Doing' ethics can become a check-list exercise where thinking is lost. But doctors are not moral philosophers. They are clinicians. A framework therefore provides a starting point from which to work. It is the toe which tests the water of moral deliberation. Be aware of the cultural setting of your dilemma and consider carefully the weight of synthesis. Be prepared to wade deeper if needed. But acknowledge that moral wisdom may well be out of your depth.
