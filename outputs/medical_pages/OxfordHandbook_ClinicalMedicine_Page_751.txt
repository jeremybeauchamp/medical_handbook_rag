### Fig 16.22 Ultrasound of the liver

Ultrasound image of the liver showing a dilated common bile duct

Shows the common bile duct (CBD) to be dilated. Distal obstruction of the CBD causes proximal dilatation of the duct. It is important to correlate the width of the CBD with the ALP, as the normal diameter varies with age and previous interventions. Also check that the distal CBD tapers as it enters the duodenum. NB: the portal vein lies posterior to the duct (along with the hepatic artery) in the free edge of the lesser omentum. Next, ask 'What is causing the obstruction?' and 'Where can I get that information?'

### Fig 16.23 Ultrasound of the kidney

Ultrasound image of the kidney showing acoustic shadow

At first the image may seem normal but there is a wedge of posterior acoustic shadow cast by the object which is causing increased echogenicity in the lower pole calyces. Acoustic shadows in the kidney suggest stones—as here—or nephrocalcinosis.

Ultrasound image of the liver showing a small area of echogenicity

Showing a well-defined small area of echogenicity. This is the typical appearance of a liver haemangioma, a common benign liver lesion.
