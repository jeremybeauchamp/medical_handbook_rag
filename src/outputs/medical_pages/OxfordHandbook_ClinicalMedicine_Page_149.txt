# New York classification of heart failure

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| I     | Heart disease present, but no undue dyspnoea from ordinary activity. |
| II    | Comfortable at rest; dyspnoea during ordinary activities. |
| III   | Less than ordinary activity causes dyspnoea, which is limiting. |
| IV    | Dyspnoea present at rest; all activity causes discomfort. |

## (a) The CXR in left ventricular failure

These features can be remembered as A B C D E:

- Alveolar oedema, classically this is perihilar 'bat's wing' shadowing
- Kerley B lines—now known as septal lines. These are variously attributed to interstitial oedema and engorged peripheral lymphatics
- Cardiomegaly—cardiothoracic ratio >50% on a PA film
- Dilated prominent upper lobe veins (upper lobe diversion)
- Pleural Effusions

Other features include peribronchial cuffing (thickened bronchial walls) and fluid in the fissures.

The image shows a diagram of the chest with labels pointing to:
- Dilated prominent upper lobe vessels
- Alveolar oedema ('Bat's wings')
- Kerley B lines (interstitial oedema)
- Cardiomegaly
- Pleural Effusion

## (b) 'Bat's wing', peri-hilar pulmonary oedema

The image shows a chest X-ray demonstrating 'Bat's wing', peri-hilar pulmonary oedema indicating heart failure and fluid overload.
