| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ECG | Shows QRS complex, P and T waves |
| Heart sounds | 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th heart sounds indicated |
| Aortic pressure | Pressure curve ranging from about 50 to 110 mmHg |
| Left atrial pressure | Low pressure curve |
| Left ventricular pressure | Pressure curve peaking during systole |
| Left ventricular volume | Volume curve ranging from about 65 to 130 mL |
| Position of atrioventricular valves | Open during diastole, closed during systole |
| Position of aortic and pulmonary valves | Closed during diastole, open during systole |
| Phase of cardiac cycle | Diastole and Systole phases shown |

1. Ventricular filling
2. Isovolumetric ventricular contraction
3. Ventricular ejection
4. Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation

The image shows end-diastolic volume at the peak of the left ventricular volume curve and end-systolic volume at the lowest point of the curve.
