# Using insulin

Vital to educate to self-adjust doses in the light of exercise, fingerprick glucose, calorie intake, and carbohydrate counting. •Phone support (trained nurse 7/24). •Can modify diet wisely and avoid binge drinking (danger of delayed hypoglycaemia). •Partner can abort hypoglycaemia: sugary drinks; GlucoGel® PO if coma (no risk of aspiration). •Dose titration to target—eg by 2–4 UNIT steps.

**It is vital to write UNITS in full when prescribing insulin to avoid misinterpretation of U for zero!**

## Subcutaneous insulins 
Short-, medium-, or long-acting. Strength: 100U/mL.

1. Ultra-fast acting (Humalog®; Novorapid®); inject at start of meal, or just after (unless sugar-laden)—helps match what is actually eaten (vs what is planned).
2. Isophane insulin (variable peak at 4–12h): favoured by NICE (it's cheap!).
3. Pre-mixed insulins (eg NovoMix® 30 = 30% short-acting and 70% long-acting).
4. Long-acting recombinant human insulin analogues (insulin glargine) are used at bedtime in type 1 or 2 DM. There is no awkward peak, so good if nocturnal hypoglycaemia is an issue. Caution if considering pregnancy. Insulin detemir is similar and has a role in intensive insulin regimens for overweight type 2 DM.

## Common insulin regimens 
**Plan the regimen to suit the lifestyle, not vice versa.** Disposable pens: dial dose; insert needle 90° to skin. Vary injection site (outer thigh/abdomen); change needle daily.

• 'BD biphasic regimen': twice daily premixed insulins by pen (eg NovoMix 30®)— useful in type 2 DM or type 1 with regular lifestyle.
• 'QDS regimen': before meals ultra-fast insulin + bedtime long-acting analogue: useful in type 1 DM for achieving a flexible lifestyle (eg for adjusting doses with size of meals, or exercise).
• Once-daily before-bed long-acting insulin: a good initial insulin regimen when switching from tablets in type 2 DM. Typical dose to work up to (slowly!): ≥1U/24h for every unit of BMI in adults. Consider retaining metformin (±pioglitazone) if needed for tight control and patient is unable to use BD regimen.

**Dose adjustment for normal eating (DAFNE):** Multidisciplinary teams promoting autonomy can save lives. DAFNE found that training in flexible, intensive insulin dosing improved glycaemic control as well as well-being. It is resource intensive.

## Subcutaneous insulin dosing during intercurrent illnesses (eg influenza)
**Advise patients to avoid stopping insulin during acute illness.**
• Illness often increases insulin requirements despite reduced food intake.
• Maintain calorie intake, eg using milk.
• Check blood glucose ≥ 4 times a day and look for ketonuria. Increase insulin doses if glucose rising. Advise to get help from a specialist diabetes nurse or GP if concerned (esp. if glucose levels are rising or ketonuria). One option is 2-hourly ultra fast-acting insulin (eg 6–8U) preceded by a fingerprick glucose check.
• Admit if vomiting, dehydrated, ketotic (**p832), a child, or pregnant.

## Insulin pumps (continous subcutaneous insulin) 
Consider when attempts to reach HbA1C with multiple daily injections have resulted in disabling hypoglycaemia or person has been unable to achieve target HbA1C despite careful management.

## Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) analogues (exenatide, liraglutide)

Work as incretin mimetics. Incretins are gut peptides that work by augmenting insulin release. Given by subcutaneous injection. Patients must have BMI >35 and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity, or have a BMI lower than 35 kg/m², and for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications, or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity-related comorbidities. To continue a GLP 1 mimetic, a person should have a beneficial metabolic response (a reduction of HbA1C by at least 11mmol/mol) and a weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months.
