## Being wrong

It is always possible to be wrong because you remain unaware of it while it is happening. Such error-blindness is why 'I am wrong' is a statement of impossibility. Once you are aware that you are wrong, you are no longer wrong, and can therefore only declare 'I was wrong'. It is also the reason that fallibility must be accepted as a universally human phenomenon. Conversely, certainty is the conviction that we cannot be wrong because our biases and beliefs must be grounded in fact. Certainty produces the comforting illusion that the world (and medicine) is knowable. But be cautious of certainty for it involves a shift in perspective inwards, towards our own convictions. This means that other people's stories can cease to matter to us. Certainty becomes lethal to empathy.

In order to determine how and why mistakes are made, error must be acknowledged and accepted. Defensiveness is bad for progress. 'I was wrong, but...' is rarely an open and honest analysis of error that will facilitate different and better action in the future. It is only with close scrutiny of mistakes that you can see the possibility of change at the core of error. And yet, medical practice is littered with examples of resistance to disclosure, and reward for the concealment of error. This must change. Remember error blindness and protect your whistle-blowers. Listen. It is an act of humility that acknowledges the position of others, and the possibility of error in yourself. Knowledge persists only until it can be disproved. Better to aspire to the aporia of Socrates:

> 'At first, he didn't know...just as he doesn't yet know the answer now either; but he still thought he knew the answer then, and he was answering confidently, as if he had knowledge. He didn't think he was stuck before, but now he appreciates that he is stuck...At any rate, it would seem that we've increased his chances of finding out the truth of the matter, because now, given his lack of knowledge, he'll be glad to undertake the investigation...Do you think he'd have tried to enquire or learn about this matter when he thought he knew it (even though he didn't), until he'd become bogged down and stuck, and had come to appreciate his ignorance and to long for knowledge?'

Plato: Meno and other dialogues, 402 BC; Waterfield translation, 2005.

## Medicine, error, and the humanities

Error provides a link between medicine and the humanities. Both strive to bridge the gap between ourselves and the world. Medicine attempts to do this in an objective manner, using disproved hypotheses (error) to progress towards a 'truth'. Art, however, accepts the unknown, and celebrates transience and subjectivity. By seeing the world through someone else's eyes, art teaches us empathy. It is at the point where art and medicine collide that doctors can re-attach themselves to the human race and feel those emotions that motivate or terrify our patients. 'Unknowing' drives medical theory, but also stories and pictures. And these are the hallmark of our highest endeavours.

> 'We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realise the truth, at least the truth that is given to us to understand.'

Pablo Picasso in Picasso Speaks, 1923.

## Duty of candour

In a world in which a 'mistake' can be redefined as a 'complication', it is easy to conceal error behind a veil of technical language. In 2014, a professional duty of candour became statutory in England for incidents that cause death, severe or moderate harm, or prolonged psychological harm. As soon as practicable, the patient must be told in person what happened, given details of further enquiries, and offered an apology. But this should not lead to the proffering of a 'tick-box' apology of questionable value. Be reassured that an apology is not an admission of liability. Risks and imperfections are inherent to medicine and you have the freedom to be sorry whenever they occur. Focus not on legislation, but on transparency and learning. The ethics of forgiveness require a complete response in which the patient's voice is placed at the heart of the process.
