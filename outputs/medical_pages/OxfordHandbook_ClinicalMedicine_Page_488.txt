# Re-enablement after stroke

Coordinated multidisciplinary care on a specialized stroke unit is essential, and leads to better patient outcomes. Rehabilitation must be started early post-stroke in order to maximize improvement and prevent complications related to immobility such as pressure sores, aspiration pneumonia, constipation, and contractures. Ongoing input after discharge consolidates inpatient gains and helps align the individual with their previous capability. It also helps with depressionâ€”both in the patient and their carer. Setting achievable goals and acknowledging the patient's own agenda is key.

## Imperatives for re-enablement

- Watch the patient swallow a small volume of water; if signs of aspiration (a cough or voice change) make nil by mouth until formal assessment by a speech therapist. Use IV fluids, then semi-solids (eg jelly; avoid soups and crumbly food). Avoid early NG tube feeds; these may be needed to safeguard nutrition in those with swallowing problems that persist beyond the first 2-3d. If swallowing fails to recover, consider benefits of enteral feeding tube placement (p759). Speech therapists skilled in assessing swallowing difficulties are invaluable here.

- Avoid further injury: minimize falls risk and take care when lifting the patient not to damage their shoulders.

- Ensure good bladder and bowel care through frequent toileting. Avoid early catheterization which may prevent return to continence.

- Position to minimize spasticity (occurs in ~40%). Get prompt physiotherapy. Splints and botulinum toxin injections are helpful for focal spasticity.

- Monitor progress: eg measure time taken to sit up and transfer to chair.

- Monitor mood: in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability (sobbing unprovoked by sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system), tricyclics or fluoxetine may help.

- Engage the patient in their own recovery by making physiotherapy fun. Swimming (a hemiplegic arm may be supported on a special float), music, and video games are all enjoyable and recovery through promoting cerebral reorganization. Constraint of the good arm may be helpful.

- Involve the carer/spouse with all aspects of care-giving. Good rehab saves lives.

## Tests

Asking to point to a named part of the body tests perceptual function. Copying matchstick patterns tests spatial ability. Dressing or copying a clock face tests for apraxia (p86). Picking out and naming easy objects from a pile tests for agnosia (acuity ok, but cannot mime use; guesses are way-out, semantically, and phonetically). Screen for depression (low mood; inability to feel pleasure or to concentrate).
