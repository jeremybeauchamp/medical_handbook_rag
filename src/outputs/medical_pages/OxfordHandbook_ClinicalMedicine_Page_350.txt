# An approach to haemolytic anaemia

Haemolysis is the premature breakdown of RBCs, before their normal lifespan of ~120d. It occurs in the circulation (intravascular) or in the reticuloendothelial system, ie macrophages of liver, spleen, and bone marrow (extravascular). In sickle-cell anaemia, lifespan may be as short as 5d. Haemolysis may be asymptomatic, but if the bone marrow does not compensate sufficiently, a haemolytic anaemia results.

An approach is first to confirm haemolysis and then find the cause—try to answer these four questions:

## 1 Is there increased red cell breakdown?
- Anaemia with normal or ↑MCV.
- ↑Bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice).
- ↑Urinary urobilinogen (no urinary conjugated bilirubin).
- ↑Serum LDH, as it is released from red cells.

## 2 Is there increased red cell production?
- ↑Reticulocytes, causing ↑MCV (reticulocytes are large immature RBCs) and polychromasia.

## 3 Is the haemolysis mainly extra- or intravascular?
Extravascular haemolysis may lead to splenic hypertrophy and splenomegaly.
Features of intravascular haemolysis are:
- ↑Free plasma haemoglobin: released from RBCs.
- Methaemalbuminaemia: some free Hb is broken down in the circulation to produce haem and globin; haem combines with albumin to make methaemalbumin.
- ↓Plasma haptoglobin: mops up free plasma Hb, then removed by the liver.
- Haemoglobinuria: causes red-brown urine, in absence of red blood cells.
- Haemosiderinuria: occurs when haptoglobin-binding capacity is exceeded, causing free Hb to be filtered by the renal glomeruli, with absorption of free Hb via the renal tubules and storage in the tubular cells as haemosiderin. This is detected in the urine as sloughed tubular cells by Prussian blue staining ~1 week after onset (implying a chronic intravascular haemolysis).

## 4 Why is there haemolysis? 
Causes are on p338.

### History 
Family history, race, jaundice, dark urine, drugs, previous anaemia, travel.

### Examination 
Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, gallstones (pigmented, due to ↑bilirubin from haemolysis), leg ulcers (due to poor blood flow).

### Tests 
FBC, reticulocytes, bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin, urinary urobilinogen. Thick and thin films for malaria screen if history of travel. The blood film may show polychromasia and macrocytosis due to reticulocytes, or point to the diagnosis:
- Hypochromic microcytic anaemia (thalassaemia).
- Sickle cells (sickle-cell anaemia).
- Schistocytes (fig 8.30, p339; microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia).
- Abnormal cells in haematological malignancy.
- Spherocytes (hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia).
- Elliptocytes (fig 8.36, p339; hereditary elliptocytosis).
- Heinz bodies, 'bite' cells (fig 8.32, p339; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency).

### Further tests (if the cause is still not obvious)
- Osmotic fragility testing will confirm the presence of membrane abnormalities which have been identified on the film.
- Hb electrophoresis will detect haemoglobinopathies.
- The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT, fig 8.28) identifies red cells coated with antibody or complement, the presence of which indicates an immune cause.
- Enzyme assays are reserved for when other causes have been excluded.
