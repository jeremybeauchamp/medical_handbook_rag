## Bedside tests in chest medicine

There is no substitute for careful history taking and examination in making the 'correct' diagnosis. Tests should help clarify and assess severity. When examining the chest think about the anatomy, and the location of pathology (fig 4.2).

### Sputum examination
Collect a good sample; if necessary ask a physiotherapist to help. Note the appearance: clear and colourless (chronic bronchitis), yellow-green or brown (pulmonary infection), red (haemoptysis), black (smoke, coal dust), or frothy white-pink (pulmonary oedema). Send the sample to the laboratory for microscopy, culture/sensitivity. If indicated, ask for ZN stain, and PCR.

### Peak expiratory flow (PEF)
Measured by a maximal forced expiration through a peak flow meter. It correlates well with the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) & is used as an estimate of airway calibre in asthma, but is effort-dependent.

### Pulse oximetry
Allows non-invasive assessment of peripheral O₂ saturation (SpO₂). Useful for monitoring those who are acutely ill or at risk of deterioration. Target oxygen saturations are usually 94-98% in a well patient or 88-92% in those with certain pre-existing lung pathology (eg COPD). Oxygen saturation of <92% in a normally well person is a serious sign and arterial blood gases (ABGs) should be checked. Causes of erroneous readings: poor perfusion, movement, skin pigmentation, nail varnish, dyshaemoglobinaemias, and carbon monoxide poisoning. As with any bedside test, be sceptical, and check ABGs, whenever indicated (p188).

### Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis
Heparinized blood is usually taken from the radial or femoral artery (see p771). The brachial artery is used less because of median nerve proximity and it is an end artery. pH, PO₂, PCO₂, HCO₃ are measured using an automated analyser.

### ABG interpretation
See pp188-9.

### Spirometry
(See table 4.1) Measures functional lung volumes. Forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV₁) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are measured from a full forced expiration into a spirometer (Vitalograph®); exhalation continues until no more breath can be exhaled. FEV₁ is less effort-dependent than PEF. The FEV₁/FVC ratio gives a good estimate of the severity of airflow obstruction; and helps classify COPD severity. Obstructive defect: (fig 4.3) Asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD, cystic fibrosis. Restrictive defect: Fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, interstitial pneumonias, connective tissue diseases, pleural effusion, obesity, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular problems.
