## Salivary gland pathology

There are three pairs of major salivary glands: parotid, submandibular, and sublingual (there are many minor glands). 
**History**: Lumps; swelling related to food; pain.
**Examination**: Note external swelling; look for secretions; bimanual palpation for stones. Examine VIIth nerve and regional lymph nodes. 
**Cytology**: Do FNA.

**Acute swelling** Think of mumps and HIV. Recurrent unilateral pain and swelling is likely to be from a stone. 80% are submandibular. The classical story is of pain and swelling on eating—with a red, tender, swollen, but uninfected gland. The stone may be seen on plain X-ray or by sialography (fig 13.20). Distal stones are removed via the mouth but deeper stones may require excision of the gland. 

**Chronic bilateral symptoms** may coexist with dry eyes and mouth and autoimmune disease, eg hypothyroidism, Mikulicz's or Sjögren's syndrome (p706 & p710)—also bulimia or alcohol excess. Fixed swelling may be from a tumour/ALL (fig 8.49, p355), sarcoid, amyloid, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or be idiopathic.

**Salivary gland tumours** (table 13.9) '80% are in the parotid, 80% of these are pleomorphic adenomas, 80% of these are in the superficial lobe.' Deflection of the ear outwards is a classic sign. Remove any salivary gland swelling for assessment if present for >1 month. VIIth nerve palsy means malignancy.

Table 13.9 Types of salivary gland tumours

| Benign or malignant | Malignant | Malignant |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Cystadenolymphoma | Mucoepidermoid | Squamous or adeno ca |
| Pleomorphic adenoma | Acinic cell | Adenoid cystic ca |

Pleomorphic adenomas often present in middle age and grow slowly. Remove by superficial parotidectomy. Adenolymphomas (Warthin's tumour): usually older men; soft; treat by enucleation. Carcinomas: rapid growth; hard fixed mass; pain; facial palsy. Treatment: surgery + radiotherapy.
