## Anaphylactic shock

Type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Release of histamine and other agents causes: capillary leak; wheeze; cyanosis; oedema (larynx, lids, tongue, lips); urticaria. More common in atopic individuals. An anaphylactoid reaction results from direct release of mediators from inflammatory cells, without involving antibodies, usually in response to a drug, eg acetylcysteine.

### Examples of precipitants
- Drugs, eg penicillin, and contrast media in radiology.
- Latex.
- Stings, eggs, fish, peanuts, strawberries, semen (rare).

### Signs and symptoms
- Itching, sweating, diarrhoea and vomiting, erythema, urticaria, oedema.
- Wheeze, laryngeal obstruction, cyanosis.
- Tachycardia, hypotension.

### Mimics of anaphylaxis
- Carcinoid (p271).
- Phaeochromocytoma (p228, p837).
- Systemic mastocytosis.
- Hereditary angioedema.
