## Hypopituitarism

Hypopituitarism entails ↓secretion of anterior pituitary hormones (figs 5.3, 5.22). They are affected in this order: growth hormone (GH), gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL). Panhypopituitarism is deficiency of all anterior hormones, usually caused by irradiation, surgery, or pituitary tumour.

### Causes are at three levels. 
1. **Hypothalamus:** Kallman's syndrome (p231), tumour, inflammation, infection (meningitis, TB), ischaemia. 
2. **Pituitary stalk:** Trauma, surgery, mass lesion (craniopharyngioma, p234), meningioma, carotid artery aneurysm.
3. **Pituitary:** Tumour, irradiation, inflammation, autoimmunity,⁷ infiltration (haemochromatosis, amyloid, metastases), ischaemia (pituitary apoplexy, p234; DIC⁸; Sheehan's syndrome⁹).

### Features are due to:
1. **Hormone lack:** 
   - **GH:** ↑central obesity, atherosclerosis, dry wrinkly skin, ↓strength, ↓balance, ↓well-being, ↓exercise ability, ↓cardiac output, osteoporosis, ↓glucose.
   - **Gonadotropin (FSH; LH):** ♀ oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, ↓fertility, ↓libido, osteoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia. ♂ Erectile dysfunction, ↓libido, ↓muscle bulk, hypogonadism (↓hair, all over; small testes; ↓ejaculate volume; ↓spermatogenesis).
   - **Thyroid:** as for hypothyroidism (p220). 
   - **Corticotropin:** as for adrenal insufficiency (p226). NB: no ↑skin pigmentation as ↓ACTH. 
   - **Prolactin:** rare: absent lactation.
2. **Causes:** Eg pituitary tumour (p234), causing mass effect, or hormone secretion with ↓secretion of other hormones—eg prolactinoma, acromegaly, rarely Cushing's.

### Tests (The triple stimulation test is now rarely done.)
- **Basal tests:** LH and FSH (↓ or →), testosterone or oestradiol (↓); TSH (↓ or →), T₄ (↓); prolactin (may be ↑, from loss of hypothalamic dopamine that normally inhibits its release), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; ↓—used as a measure of GH axis, p238), cortisol (↓). Also do U&E (Na⁺↓from dilution), Hb (normochromic, normocytic).
- **Dynamic tests:** 
  1. Short Synacthen® test: (p226) to assess the adrenal axis.
  2. Insulin tolerance test (ITT): done in specialist centres to assess the adrenal and GH axes. CI: epilepsy, heart disease, adrenal failure. Consult lab first. It involves IV insulin to induce hypoglycaemia, causing stress to ↑cortisol and GH secretion. It is done in the morning (water only taken from 2200h the night before). Have 50% glucose and hydrocortisone to hand and IV access. Glucose must fall below 2.2mmol/L and the patient should become symptomatic when cortisol and GH are taken. Normal: GH >20mU/L, and peak cortisol >550nmol/L.
  3. Arginine + growth hormone-releasing hormone test.
  4. Glucagon stimulation test is alternative when ITT is contraindicated.
- **Investigate cause:** MRI scan to look for a hypothalamic or pituitary lesion.

### Treatment 
Refer to an endocrinologist for assessment of pituitary fuction and to oversee hormone replacement and treatment of underlying cause.
- **Hydrocortisone** for 2° adrenal failure (p226) before other hormones are given.
- **Thyroxine** if hypothyroid (p220, but TSH is useless for monitoring).
- **Hypogonadism** (for symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis). ♂: options include testosterone enanthate 250mg IM every 3 weeks, daily topical gels or buccal mucoadhesive tablets. Patches (eg Testogel®) are also used. ♀: (premenopausal). Oestrogen: transdermal oestradiol patches, or contraceptive pill (exceeds replacement needs) ± testosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA, in hypoandrogenic women; a small amount may improve well-being and sexual function, and help bone mineral density and lean body mass).
- **Gonadotropin therapy** is needed to induce fertility in both men and women.
- **Growth hormone (GH).** Somatotrophin mimics human GH. It addresses problems of ↑fat mass, ↓bone mass, ↓lean body mass (muscle bulk), ↓exercise capacity, and problems with heat intolerance.

7. Autoimmune hypophysitis (=inflamed pituitary) mimics pituitary adenoma. It may be triggered by pregnancy or immunotherapy blocking CTLA-4. No pituitary auto-antigen is yet used diagnostically.
8. Snake bite is a common cause in India (eg when associated with acute kidney injury).
9. Sheehan's syndrome is pituitary necrosis after postpartum haemorrhage.
