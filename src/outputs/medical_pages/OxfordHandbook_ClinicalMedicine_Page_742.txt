# Plain abdominal x-ray

These are rarely diagnostic and involve a radiation dose equivalent to 50 CXRs. Indications for AXR with acute abdominal symptoms:

- Suspicion of obstruction (or intussusception, eg in paediatrics).
- Acute flare of inflammatory bowel disease (eg to confirm/exclude megacolon).
- Renal colic with known renal stones (if first presentation, CT KUB is better).
- Ingestion of a sharp or poisonous foreign body (eg lithium battery).

Bowel gas pattern is best assessed on supine images and free intraperitoneal gas (signifying perforation) is best seen on an erect CXR (fig 13.26, p607).

## Gas patterns
Look for: an abnormal quantity of gas in the stomach, small intestine, or colon. Decide whether you are looking at small or large bowel (fig 16.8; table 16.3).

Small bowel diameter is normally ~2.5cm, the colon ~5cm, the caecum up to 10cm. Dilated small bowel is seen in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Dilated large bowel (>6cm) is seen in both these, and also in "toxic dilatation", and, in the elderly, in benign hypotonicity. Grossly dilated segments of bowel (coffee bean sign) are seen in sigmoid and caecal volvulae—fig 13.26c, p611. Loss of normal mucosal folds and bowel wall thickening are seen in inflammatory colitis (eg IBD)—fig 16.9. 'Thumb-printing' is protrusion of thickened mural folds into the lumen, seen in large bowel ischaemia and colitis.

### Table 16.3 Radiological gas patterns in the bowel

| Small bowel | Large bowel | Ileus |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| - Smaller calibre | - Larger calibre | - Both small and large bowel visible |
| - Central; multiple loops | - Peripheral | - There is no clear transition point that corresponds to an obstructing lesion |
| - Valvuli conniventes: folds that go from wall to wall, all the way across the lumen; more regular and finer than haustra | - Semi-lunar folds:* don't go all the way across the lumen, but may appear to do so if viewed from an angle | |
| - Grey (contains air and fluid) | - Blacker (contains gas)† | |

*Semi-lunar folds (plicae semilunares) lie in between adjacent haustra.
†The ascending colon contains liquid faeces, but the descending colon contains faecal pellets (scybala).

## Gas outside the lumen
You must explain any gas outside the lumen of the gut. It could be:
1. Pneumoperitoneum; signs on the supine AXR include: gas on both sides of the bowel wall (Rigler's sign), a triangle of gas in the RUQ trapped beneath the falciform ligament, and a circle of gas beneath the anterior abdominal wall. Seen with bowel perforation but also after laparoscopic surgery.
2. Gas in the urinary tract—eg in the bladder from a fistula.
3. Gas in the biliary tree (see next paragraph), or rarely
4. Intramural gas, found in bowel necrosis.

## Biliary tree
Any stones: ~10% visible on plain AXR. Any gas: (Pneumobilia.) Caused by: 
- post-ERCP/sphincterotomy 
- post-surgery (eg Whipple's) 
- recent stone passage
- anaerobic cholangitis (rare) 
- gallbladder–bowel fistula: gallstone migrates directly into the bowel (Rigler's triad is seen in 25%: pneumobilia, small bowel obstruction, an ectopic gallstone). 

Calcification: ('Porcelain gallbladder'.) Chronic inflammation from gallstones (associated with gallbladder cancer).

## Urinary tract
Check for calculi (visible in 90% of cases)¹ and normal anatomy: Kidneys: Length equivalent to 2½–3½ vertebral bodies, slope inferolaterally. Right is lower than the left ('pushed down' by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding layer of perinephric fat. Ureters: Pass near the tips of the lumbar transverse processes, cross the sacroiliac joints, down to the ischial spines, and turn medially to join the bladder.

## Other soft tissues
Look for size/position of: liver, spleen, and bladder. A big liver will push bowel to the left side of the abdomen. An enlarged spleen displaces bowel and stomach bubble to the right. A big bladder elevates these.

## Medical devices
Double-J and biliary stents, nephrostomy and gastrostomy tubes, intrauterine devices, laparoscopic clips, and peritoneal dialysis catheters can be seen.

## Bones and joints
Plain AXR is not ideal, but there may be important abnormalities. In the lumbar spine, look for scoliosis and degeneration (osteophytes, joint space narrowing) as well as bone metastases or sacroiliitis.

¹ Don't get confused by other calcifications—eg phleboliths: harmless calcifications found in the perivesical veins (rounded with a radiolucent centre).
