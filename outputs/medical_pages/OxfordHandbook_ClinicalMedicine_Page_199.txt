*Tiotropium (LAMA) is more effective than salmeterol in preventing exacerbations for patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD.4

- Pulmonary rehabilitation is greatly valued by patients.
- Consider LTOT if PaO2 <7.3kPa (see 'Long-term O2 therapy', earlier in topic OPPOSITE).
- Surgery may be appropriate in selected patients, eg recurrent pneumothoraces; isolated bullous disease. Lung volume reduction/endobronchial valve/transplant.
- NIV may be appropriate if hypercapnic on LTOT.
- NB: air travel is risky if FEV1 <50% or PaO2 <6.7kPa on air.
- Consider palliative care input.

### Indications for specialist referral

- Uncertain diagnosis, or suspected severe COPD, or a rapid decline in FEV1.
- Onset of cor pulmonale.
- Bullous lung disease (to assess for surgery).
- Assessment for oral corticosteroids, nebulizer therapy, or LTOT.
- <10 pack-years smoking (= the number of packs/day × years of smoking) or COPD in patient <40yrs (eg is the cause α1-antitrypsin deficiency? p290).
- Symptoms disproportionate to lung function tests.
- Frequent infections (to exclude bronchiectasis).

4 Cochrane meta-analyses (2007) of trials (including TORCH) favour steroids + LABA (long-acting β-agonist) vs either alone. LABA alone may ↑ exacerbation rates, but no excess hospitalizations or mortality; steroid inhalers alone are associated with ↑ mortality (by 33%) compared with steroids + LABA.4 Steroid inhalers may ↑ risk of pneumonia, but when combined with LABA, advantages outweigh disadvantages.
