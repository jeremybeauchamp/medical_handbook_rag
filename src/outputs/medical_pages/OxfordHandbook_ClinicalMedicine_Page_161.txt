Fig 3.44 Severely calcified aortic valve.

Fig 3.45 This is one of the two main types of transcatheter aortic valve implants: animal valve leaflets mounted on metal stents. This extraordinary structure must be resilient against the movement of the heart walls and the powerful flow of blood; it must avoid obstructing forward flow of blood whilst providing a near-complete block to backflow; and it has surfaces of foreign material yet must avoid triggering clots or allowing microbial growth. On top of this, it must be able to fold down over a wire to allow safe passage through the arterial tree from the groin to the heart, before being opened out by an inflated balloon.

| Fig 3.44 | The image shows a severely calcified aortic valve during a surgical procedure. Various surgical instruments can be seen, and the valve appears thickened and rigid, characteristic of severe calcification. |
| Fig 3.45 | The image displays a transcatheter aortic valve implant. It shows a circular structure with animal valve leaflets mounted on a metal stent. The stent has a honeycomb-like pattern and is designed to be collapsible for insertion and expandable once in place. |
