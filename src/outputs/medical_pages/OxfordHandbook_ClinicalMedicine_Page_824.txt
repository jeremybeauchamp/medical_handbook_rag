# 810 Acute severe asthma

- The severity of an attack is easily underestimated.
- An atmosphere of calm helps.

**Presentation** Acute breathlessness and wheeze.

**History** (See p48.) Ask about usual and recent treatment; previous acute episodes and their severity and best peak expiratory flow rate (PEF). Have they been admitted to ICU?

**Differential diagnosis** Acute infective exacerbation of COPD, pulmonary oedema, upper respiratory tract obstruction, pulmonary embolus, anaphylaxis.

**Investigations** PEF—but may be too ill; ABG if saturations <92% or life-threatening features; CXR (if suspicion of pneumothorax, infection or life-threatening attack); FBC; U&E.

## Assessing the severity of an acute asthma attack

**Severe attack:**
- Unable to complete sentences in one breath.
- Respiratory rate ≥ 25/min.
- Pulse rate ≥110 beats/min.
- PEF 33-50% of predicted or best.

**Life-threatening attack:**
- PEF <33% of predicted or best.
- Silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory effort.
- Arrhythmia or hypotension.
- Exhaustion, confusion, or coma.
- Arterial blood gases:
  - Normal/high PCO₂ >4.6kPa.
  - PO₂ <8kPa, or SaO₂ <92%.

**Management** Rapid treatment and reassessment is key, see fig 19.12.
- Salbutamol 5mg nebulized with oxygen and give prednisolone 30mg PO.
- If PEF remains <75%, repeat salbutamol; add ipratropium.
- Monitor oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
- Admit all with severe features not responding to initial treatment or with life-threatening features.

NB: the routine use of antibiotics is not recommended in exacerbations of asthma.

**Discharge** Patients with PEF >75% within 1h of initial treatment can be discharged if no other reason to admit. Otherwise, before discharge patients must have:
- been stable on discharge medication for 24h
- had inhaler technique checked
- peak flow rate >75% predicted or best with diurnal variability <25%
- steroid (inhaled and oral) and bronchodilator therapy
- their own PEF meter and have written management plan
- GP appointment within 2d
- respiratory clinic appointment within 4wks.

## Drugs used in acute asthma

**Salbutamol** (β₂-agonist). SE: tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, ↓K⁺.

**Hydrocortisone** and **prednisolone** (steroid; reduces inflammation).

**Aminophylline** is used much less frequently and is not routinely recommended in current BTS guidelines, but may be initiated by respiratory team or ICU. It inhibits phosphodiesterase; ↑[cAMP]. SE: ↑pulse, arrhythmias, nausea, seizures. The amount of IVI aminophylline may need altering according to the individual patient: always check the BNF. Monitor ECG. Aim for plasma concentration of 10-20mcg/mL (55-110μmol/L). Serious toxicity (↓BP arrhythmias, cardiac arrest) can occur at concentrations ≥25mcg/mL. Measure plasma K⁺: theophyllines may cause ↓K⁺. Don't load patients already on oral preparations. Stick with one brand (bioavailability varies).
