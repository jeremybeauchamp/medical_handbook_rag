## HIV: antiretroviral therapy (ART)

> Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for everyone with HIV, regardless of CD4 count.

### Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study, 2015

4685 participants (215 sites, 35 countries) with HIV, CD4 >500 cells/microlitre, no previous ART. Randomized to:
- immediate ART
- deferred ART until CD4 <350 cells/microlitre or AIDS-defining illness.

Study was terminated early when an independent interim analysis revealed benefit to immediate initiation of ART, and recommended that patients on the deferred group start ART. Immediate initiation of ART reduced the risk of AIDS, serious non-AIDS events, or death by 57% (CI 38-70%) at 3 years.

### Aims of ART
To reduce the HIV viral load to a level undetectable by standard laboratory techniques leading to immunological recovery, reduced clinical progression, and reduced mortality. These aims should be met with the least possible side-effects.

### Mechanism of action (See fig 9.13)
- CCR5 antagonists inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor.
- Nucleos(t)ide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, NNRTIs) inhibit reverse transcriptase and the conversion of viral RNA into DNA.
- Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit integrase and prevent HIV DNA integrating into the nucleus.
- Protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit protease, an enzyme involved in the maturation of virus particles.
- Pharmacokinetic enhancers/boosters increase the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs allowing lower doses eg cobicistat, ritonavir.

1. Counselling: HIV transmission and sexual health, benefits of therapy (not cure), adherence (life long), resistance, side-effects of treatment, necessary monitoring, disclosure to partner/family/friends, partner testing.

2. Screen for infections and malignancy (pp400-1). Includes TB, hepatitis B&C. Treat or offer prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole if CD4 <200 cells/microlitre. For latent TB see p395. Aim to start ART within 2 weeks of initiation of antimicrobial treatment for opportunistic or serious infection (seek expert advice if drug interactions or intracerebral disease).

3. Baseline tests: CD4, viral load, FBC, LFT, electrolytes, creatinine, pregnancy test, viral genotype for drug resistance.

4. Review usual medications for possible drug interactions. Advise the patient to check for drug interactions with any new medication.
