ECG showing changes in pulmonary hypertension

Fig 3.11   Changes seen in pulmonary hypertension (eg after a PE).

• Right axis deviation (QRS more negative than positive in lead I);
• Positive QRS complexes ('dominant R waves') in V1 and V2 suggesting right ventricular hypertrophy;
• ST depression and T-wave inversion in the right precordial leads (V1-3) suggesting right ventricular strain;
• Peaked P waves (P pulmonale) suggesting right atrial hypertrophy.

| Lead | ECG Tracing Description |
|------|--------------------------|
| I    | QRS complexes more negative than positive, indicating right axis deviation |
| II   | Normal sinus rhythm with some ST changes |
| III  | Prominent R waves |
| aVR  | Inverted P, QRS, and T waves as expected |
| aVL  | Small complexes |
| aVF  | Similar to lead III |
| V1   | Dominant R wave, suggesting right ventricular hypertrophy |
| V2   | Dominant R wave, suggesting right ventricular hypertrophy |
| V3   | Transition zone with R/S ratio near 1 |
| V4   | Predominant S wave |
| V5   | Predominant S wave |
| V6   | Predominant S wave |

The ECG shows characteristic changes of pulmonary hypertension, including right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and signs of right ventricular strain.
