# Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

An inflammatory liver disease of unknown cause[33] characterized by abnormal T-cell function and autoantibodies directed against hepatocyte surface antigens. Classification is by autoantibodies (see table 6.12). AIH predominantly affects young or middle-aged women (bimodal, ie 10-30yrs—or >40yrs old). Up to 40% present with acute hepatitis and signs of autoimmune disease, eg fever, malaise, urticarial rash, polyarthritis, pleurisy, pulmonary infiltration, or glomerulonephritis. The remainder present with gradual jaundice or are asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally with signs of chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common and disease tends to attenuate during pregnancy. 

**Complications** Those associated with cirrhosis (p276) and drug therapy.

**Tests** Serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP all usually ↑, hypergammaglobulinaemia (esp. IgG), +ve autoantibodies (see table 6.12). Anaemia, ↓WCC, and ↓platelets indicate hypersplenism. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Mononuclear infiltrate of portal and periportal areas and piecemeal necrosis ± fibrosis; cirrhosis ≈ worse prognosis. MRCP: (See p742.) Helps exclude PSC if ALP ↑ disproportionately.

**Diagnosis** Depends on excluding other diseases (no lab test is pathognomonic). Diagnostic criteria based on IgG levels, autoantibodies, and histology in the absence of viral disease are helpful. Sometimes diagnosis is a challenge—there is overlap with other chronic liver disease: eg PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis.

| Table 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I-II |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| I Seen in 80%. Typical patient: ♀ <40yrs. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve in 80%. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) +ve in 10%. IgG ↑ in 97%. Good response to immunosuppression in 80%. 25% have cirrhosis at presentation. |
| II Commoner in Europe than USA. More often seen in children, and more commonly progresses to cirrhosis and less treatable. Typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve. ASMA and ANA −ve. |

**Management** Immunosuppressant therapy: Prednisolone 30mg/d PO for 1 month; ↓ by 5mg a month to a maintenance dose of 5-10mg/d PO. Corticosteroids can sometimes be stopped after 2yrs but relapse occurs in 50-86%. Azathioprine (50-100mg/d PO) may be used as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission. Remission is achievable in 80% of patients within 3yrs. 10- and 20yr survival rates are >80%. SEs are a big problem (p376)—partly ameliorated by a switch to budesonide, eg in non-cirrhotic AIH.

Liver transplantation: (See p277.) Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if there is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is effective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%).

**Prognosis** Appears not to matter whether symptomatic or asymptomatic at presentation (10yr survival ~80% for both). The presence of cirrhosis at presentation reduces 10yr survival from 94% to 62%. Overlap syndromes: AIH-PBC (primary biliary cholangitis) overlap is worse than AIH-AIC (autoimmune cholangitis).

[33] Hepatotropic viruses (eg measles, herpes viruses) and some drugs appear to trigger AIH in genetically predisposed individuals exposed to a hepatotoxic milieu intérieur. Viral interferon can inactivate cytochrome P450 enzymes (↓ metabolism of ex- or endogenous hepatotoxins). Resulting modifications to proteins may generate autoantigens driving CD4 T-helper cell activation.
