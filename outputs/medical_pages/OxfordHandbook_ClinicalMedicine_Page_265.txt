## Causes of dysphagia

| Mechanical block | Motility disorders |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Malignant stricture (fig 6.13) | Achalasia (see p250) |
| - Pharyngeal cancer | Diffuse oesophageal spasm |
| - Oesophageal cancer | Systemic sclerosis (p552) |
| - Gastric cancer | Neurological bulbar palsy (p507) |
| Benign strictures | Pseudobulbar palsy (p507) |
| - Oesophageal web or ring (p250) | Wilson's or Parkinson's disease |
| - Peptic stricture | Syringobulbia (p516) |
| Extrinsic pressure | Bulbar poliomyelitis (p436) |
| - Lung cancer | Chagas' disease (p423) |
| - Mediastinal lymph nodes | Myasthenia gravis (p512) |
| - Retrosternal goitre | |
| - Aortic aneurysm | **Others** |
| - Left atrial enlargement | Oesophagitis (p254; reflux or Candida/HSV) |
| Pharyngeal pouch | Globus (='I've got a lump in my throat': try to dis- tinguish from true dysphagia) |

## Remembering your anti-emetics

One way of recalling anti-emetics involves using (simplified) pharmacology.

### Table 6.4 Pharmacology of common anti-emetics

| Receptor | Antagonist | Dose | Notes |
|----------|------------|------|-------|
| H1 | Cyclizine | 50mg/8h PO/IV/IM | GI causes |
|    | Cinnarizine | 30mg/8h PO | Vestibular disorders |
| D2 | Metoclopramide | 10mg/8h PO/IV/IM | GI causes; also prokinetic |
|    | Domperidone | 60mg/12h PR<br>20mg/6h PO | Also prokinetic |
|    | Prochlorperazine | 12.5mg IM;<br>5mg/8h PO | Vestibular/GI causes |
|    | Haloperidol | 1.5mg/12h PO | Chemical causes, eg opioids |
| 5HT3 | Ondansetron | 4-8mg/8h IV slowly | Doses can be higher for, eg emetogenic chemotherapy |
| Others | Hyoscine hydro-bromide | 200-600mcg SC/IM | Antimuscarinic :. also anti-spasmodic and antisecretory (don't prescribe with a prokinetic) |
|        | Dexamethasone | 6-10mg/d PO/SC | Unknown mode of action; an adjuvant |
|        | Midazolam | 2-4mg/d SC<br>(syringe driver) | Unknown action; anti-emetic effect outlasts sedative effectÂ³ |

> All antidopaminergics can cause dystonias and oculogyric crisis, especially in younger patients.

5 Non-propulsive contractions manifest as tertiary contractions or 'corkscrew oesophagus' (fig 16.34, p743) and suggest a motility disorder and may lead to acid clearance. Symptoms and radiology may not match. Nutcracker oesophagus denotes distal peristaltic contractions >180mmHg. It may cause pain, relieved by nitrates or sublingual nifedipine.
