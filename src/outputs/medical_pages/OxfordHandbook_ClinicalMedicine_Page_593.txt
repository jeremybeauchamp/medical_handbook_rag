# Swollen legs

Bilateral oedema implies systemic disease with ↑venous pressure (eg right heart failure) or ↓intravascular oncotic pressure (any cause of ↓albumin, so test the urine for protein). It is dependent (distributed by gravity), which is why legs are affected early, but severe oedema extends above the legs. In the bed-bound, fluid moves to the new dependent area, causing a sacral pad. The exception is the local increase in venous pressure occurring in IVC obstruction: the swelling neither extends above the legs nor redistributes. Causes: 
- Right heart failure (p134). 
- ↓Albumin (p686, eg renal or liver failure). 
- Venous insufficiency: acute, eg prolonged sitting, or chronic, with haemosiderin-pigmented, itchy, eczematous skin ± ulcers. 
- Vasodilators, eg nifedipine, amlodipine. 
- Pelvic mass (p57, p604). 
- Pregnancy—if BP + proteinuria, diagnose pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48): find an obstetrician urgently. In all the above, both legs need not be affected to the same extent.

Unilateral oedema Pain ± redness implies DVT or inflammation, eg cellulitis or insect bites (any blisters?). Bone or muscle may be to blame, eg tumours; necrotizing fasciitis (p660); trauma (check for sensation, pulses, and severe pain esp. on passive movement: a compartment syndrome with ischaemic necrosis needs prompt fasciotomy). Impaired mobility suggests trauma, arthritis, or a Baker's cyst (p694). Non-pitting oedema is oedema you cannot indent: see p35.

Nine questions to ask:
1. Is it both legs?
2. Is she pregnant?
3. Is she mobile?
4. Any trauma?
5. Any pitting (p35)?
6. Past diseases/on drugs?
7. Any pain?
8. Any skin changes?
9. Any oedema elsewhere?

Tests: Look for proteinuria (+hypoalbuminaemia ≈nephrotic syndrome). CCF?

Treatment of leg oedema: Treat the cause. Diuretics for all is not an answer. Elevating legs for dependent oedema (ankles higher than hips—do not just use footstools); raise the foot of the bed. Graduated support stockings may help (CI: ischaemia).

## Travel and DVT

Long-distance travel appears to be a risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data suggests this is not confined to air travel, increases with the duration of travel, and results in clinical thrombosis more often in travellers with pre-existing risk factors. Dehydration, immobilization, decreased oxygen tension, and prolonged sitting have all been suggested as contributory factors.

The risk of developing a DVT from a long-distance flight has been estimated at 1 in 10000 to 1 in 40000 for the general population.

- The incidence of DVT in high-risk groups has been shown to be 4–6% for flights >10h. Travellers with ≥1 risk factor should consider compression stockings. For high-risk individuals consider a single dose of prophylactic LMWH for flights >6h.
- There is ↑risk of PE associated with long-distance air travel.
- Compression stockings may ↓risk of DVT.
- There is no evidence to support the use of prophylactic aspirin.
- Risk reduction measures: leg exercises, increased water intake, and refraining from alcohol or caffeine during the journey.
