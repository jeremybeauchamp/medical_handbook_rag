The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with the following content:

| Lead | ECG Tracing |
|------|-------------|
| I    | Low amplitude waves with slight ST elevation |
| aVR  | Inverted P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves |
| V1   | Prominent ST elevation with T wave inversion |
| V4   | Marked ST elevation with upright T waves |
| II   | Normal P waves, QRS complexes with ST elevation |
| aVL  | Low amplitude waves with slight ST depression |
| V2   | Prominent ST elevation with upright T waves |
| V5   | Marked ST elevation with upright T waves |
| III  | Normal P waves, QRS complexes with ST elevation |
| aVF  | Normal P waves, QRS complexes with ST elevation |
| V3   | Prominent ST elevation with upright T waves |
| V6   | Marked ST elevation with upright T waves |

Fig 3.51 Pericarditis. Note the widespread 'saddle-shaped' ST elevationâ€”particularly clear in V5 and V6.
