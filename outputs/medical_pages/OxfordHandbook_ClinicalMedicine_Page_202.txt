# Respiratory failure

Respiratory failure occurs when gas exchange is inadequate, resulting in hypoxia. It is defined as a PaO2 <8kPa and subdivided into two types according to PaCO2 level.

## Type I respiratory failure
Defined as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with a normal or low PaCO2. It is caused primarily by ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoventilation, abnormal diffusion, right to left cardiac shunts. Examples of V/Q mismatch:

- Pneumonia.
- Pulmonary oedema.
- PE.
- Asthma.
- Emphysema.
- Pulmonary fibrosis.
- ARDS (p186).

## Type II respiratory failure
Defined as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.0kPa). This is caused by alveolar hypoventilation, with or without V/Q mismatch. Causes include:

- Pulmonary disease: Asthma, COPD, pneumonia, end-stage pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA, p194).
- Reduced respiratory drive: Sedative drugs, CNS tumour or trauma.
- Neuromuscular disease: Cervical cord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, poliomyelitis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- Thoracic wall disease: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis.

## Clinical features
Are those of the underlying cause together with symptoms and signs of hypoxia, with or without hypercapnia.

Hypoxia: Dyspnoea; restlessness; agitation; confusion; central cyanosis. If long-standing hypoxia: polycythaemia; pulmonary hypertension; cor pulmonale.

Hypercapnia: Headache; peripheral vasodilation; tachycardia; bounding pulse; tremor/flap; papilloedema; confusion; drowsiness; coma.

## Investigations
Are aimed at determining the underlying cause:

- Blood tests: FBC, U&E, CRP, ABG. See table 4.7.
- Radiology: CXR.
- Microbiology: sputum and blood cultures (if febrile).
- Spirometry (COPD, neuromuscular disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome).

## Management
Depends on the cause:

### Type I respiratory failure:
- Treat underlying cause.
- Give oxygen (24-60%) by facemask.
- Assisted ventilation if PaO2 <8kPa despite 60% O2.

### Type II respiratory failure:
The respiratory centre may be relatively insensitive to CO2 and respiration could be driven by hypoxia.

- Treat underlying cause.
- Controlled oxygen therapy: start at 24% O2. Oxygen therapy should be given with care. Nevertheless, don't leave the hypoxia untreated.
- Recheck ABG after 20min. If PaCO2 is steady or lower, increase O2 concentration to 28%. If PaCO2 has risen >1.5kPa and the patient is still hypoxic, consider assisted ventilation (eg NIPPV, p813, ie non-invasive positive pressure ventilation).
- If this fails, consider intubation and ventilation, if appropriate.

## When to consider ABG (arterial blood gas) measurement

- Any unexpected deterioration in an ill patient. (Technique: see p771.)
- Anyone with an acute exacerbation of a chronic chest condition.
- Anyone with impaired consciousness or impaired respiratory effort.
- Signs of CO2 retention, eg bounding pulse, drowsy, tremor (flapping), headache.
- Cyanosis, confusion, visual hallucinations (signs of PaO2; SaO2 is an alternative).
- To validate measurements from transcutaneous pulse oximetry (p162).
