# Cancer diagnosis

A variety of clinical signs and symptoms should alert you to the possible presence of malignancy. The following list is based on clinical features with a 3% positive predictive value for cancer. It is by no means exhaustive and does not negate the value of clinical judgement. Urgent = within 2 weeks.

## Lung
- Admit if: symptomatic superior vena caval obstruction (p528), stridor.
- Urgent referral if: >40yrs with unexplained haemoptysis, CXR suggestive of cancer.
- Urgent CXR if >40yrs and:
  - persistent/recurrent chest infection
  - finger clubbing
  - supraclavicular/cervical lymphadenopathy
  - thrombocytosis
  - two of: cough, fatigue, SOB, chest pain, weight loss, ↓appetite, smoker, asbestos.

## Upper GI
- Urgent endoscopy if: dysphagia, or >55yrs with weight loss and upper abdominal pain/reflux/dyspepsia.
- Urgent referral if: >40yrs plus jaundice, or upper abdominal mass.
- Urgent CT of the pancreas if >60yrs plus weight loss plus any of: diarrhoea, back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, new-onset diabetes.
- Non-urgent endoscopy if:
  - >55yrs and one of: treatment-resistant dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain plus low Hb, ↑plts, or N&V plus upper GI symptoms/weight loss
  - haematemesis.

## Lower GI
PR examination and FBC in all.
- Urgent referral if: positive faecal occult blood, >40yrs with abdominal pain plus weight loss, >50yrs with unexplained rectal bleeding, >60yrs with iron-deficient anaemia or change in bowel habit.
- Consider urgent referral if: rectal/abdominal mass, anal ulceration, <50yrs with rectal bleeding plus lower GI symptoms or weight loss or iron-deficiency anaemia.
- Faecal occult blood testing if: >50yrs plus abdominal pain or weight loss, <60yrs with change in bowel habit or iron-deficiency anaemia, >60yrs and anaemia.

## Gynaecological
- Urgent referral if: ascites, pelvic mass (fibroid excluded), >55yrs with post-menopausal bleeding.

## Breast
- Urgent referral if: >30yrs with unexplained breast lump, >50yrs with symptoms or change to one nipple.
- Consider urgent referral if: skin changes, >30yrs with axillary lump.

## Urology
- Urgent referral if:
  - irregular prostate on PR, abnormal age-specific PSA (see p530)
  - >40yrs with unexplained visible haematuria, >60yrs with unexplained non-visible haematuria plus dysuria or ↑WCC
  - non-painful enlargement or change in shape/texture of testicle.

## Central nervous system
- Urgent MRI in progressive, sub-acute loss of central neurological function.

Unexplained weight loss, ↓appetite, and DVT can be non-specific signs of cancer. Assess for any additional risk factors, symptoms, signs, and refer accordingly.
