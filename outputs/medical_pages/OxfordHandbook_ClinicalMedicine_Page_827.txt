# Management of acute COPD

## Nebulized bronchodilators:
Salbutamol 5mg/4h and ipratropium 500mcg/6h
Investigate: CXR, ABG

## Controlled oxygen therapy if S₂O₂ <88% or P₂O₂ <7 kPa:
Start at 24-28%, aim sats 88-92%
Adjust according to ABG, aim P₂O₂ >8.0kPa with a rise in P₂CO₂ <1.5kPa

## Steroids:
IV hydrocortisone 200mg and oral prednisolone
30mg OD (continue for 7-14d)

## Antibiotics:
Use if evidence of infection, eg amoxicillin 500mg/8h PO,
alternatively clarithromycin or doxycycline (p387)

## Physiotherapy to aid sputum expectoration

## If no response to nebulizers and steroids:
Consider IV aminophylline*

## If no response:
1. Consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation† (NIPPV) if
   respiratory rate >30 or pH <7.35, or P₂CO₂ rising despite best
   medical treatment. OR:
2. Consider a respiratory stimulant drug, eg doxapram 1.5-4mg/
   min IV in patients who are not suitable for mechanical ventila-
   tion. SE: agitation, confusion, tachycardia, nausea. It is a
   short-term measure, used only if NIV is not available

## Consider intubation and ventilation if pH <7.26 and P₂CO₂ is rising
despite non-invasive ventilation only where appropriate (see
'Consider the ceiling of care' in text)

*Load with 250mg over 20min, then infuse at a rate of ~500mcg/kg/h (300mcg/kg/h if elderly), where kg is
ideal body weight. Do not give a loading dose to patients on maintenance methylxanthines (theophyllines/
aminophylline; see p811). Check plasma levels if given for >24h. ECG monitoring is required.

†This may alone serve as a rescue therapy, be an intermittent step before ventilation, or be considered as a
'ceiling of therapy' for those deemed not suitable for mechanical ventilation.
