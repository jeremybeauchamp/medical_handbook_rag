## Grading hypertensive retinopathy

1. Tortuous arteries with thick shiny walls (silver or copper wiring, p560, fig 12.18).
2. AV nipping (narrowing where arteries cross veins, p560, fig 12.19).
3. Flame haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots.
4. Papilloedema, p560, fig 12.20.

## Measuring BP with a sphygmomanometer

- Use the correct size cuff. The cuff width should be >40% of the arm circumference. The bladder should be centred over the brachial artery, and the cuff applied snugly. Support the arm in a horizontal position at mid-sternal level.
- Inflate the cuff while palpating the brachial artery, until the pulse disappears. This provides an estimate of systolic pressure.
- Inflate the cuff until 30mmHg above systolic pressure, then place stethoscope over the brachial artery. Deflate the cuff at 2mmHg/s.
- Systolic pressure: appearance of sustained repetitive tapping sounds (Korotkoff I).
- Diastolic pressure: usually the disappearance of sounds (Korotkoff V). However, in some individuals (eg pregnant women) sounds are present until the zero point. In this case, the muffling of sounds, Korotkoff IV, should be used. State which is used for a given reading. For children, see OHCS p157.

Fig 3.40 Managing suspected hypertension.

Target pressure is <140/90mmHg (150/90 if aged >80), but in diabetes mellitus aim for <130/80mmHg, and <125/75 if proteinuria. To quantify CV risk, see www.bhsoc.org. NB: CV threshold of 20% ≈ 15% for CHD alone.
Examples of target (end-organ) damage: • LVH • PMH of MI or angina • PMH of stroke/TIA • Peripheral vascular disease • Renal failure.
