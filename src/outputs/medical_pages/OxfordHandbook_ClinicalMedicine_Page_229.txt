# Insulinoma

This often benign (90-95%) pancreatic islet cell tumour is sporadic or seen with MEN-1 (p223). It presents as fasting hypoglycaemia, with Whipple's triad:

1. Symptoms associated with fasting or exercise.
2. Recorded hypoglycaemia with symptoms.
3. Symptoms relieved with glucose.

**Screening test** Hypoglycaemia + ↑plasma insulin during a long fast.

**Suppressive tests** Give IV insulin and measure C-peptide. Normally exogenous insulin suppresses C-peptide production, but this does not occur in insulinoma.

**Imaging** CT/MRI ± endoscopic pancreatic US ± IACS (see BOX; all fallible, so don't waste too much time before proceeding to intra-operative visualization ± intra-operative ultrasound). 18F-L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine PET-CT can help guide laparoscopic surgery.

**Treatment** Excision.

**Nesidioblastosis** See BOX. If this doesn't work, options are: ↑diet, diazoxide, dextrose IVI, enteral feeding, everolimus.

## Pursuing a voyage to the islets of Langerhans to the bitter end

A 50-year-old had episodic early-morning sweats and tremors and was found to have hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (= Nesidioblastosis). Selective intra-arterial calcium infusions (IACS) showed a 2-fold increase in insulin secretion after infusion of the splenic and superior mesenteric arteries, so setting the stage for 'hunt the insulinoma'.

But cross-sectional imaging and endoscopic ultrasound were normal. At laparotomy, no lesion was found despite mobilization of the pancreas, or during intra-operative ultrasound. 'Time to sew up and go home?' 'No!' said the surgeon, 'I'm going to do a distal pancreatectomy'. Histology showed no discrete insulinoma, but diffuse islet cell hyperplasia (nesidioblastosis). How much pancreas to resect? Too little and nothing is gained: too much spells pancreatic endocrine disaster. Luckily the surgeon guessed right, and the patient was cured by the procedure.
