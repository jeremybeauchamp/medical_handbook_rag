## Status epilepticus

This means seizures lasting for >30min, or repeated seizures without intervening consciousness. Mortality and the risk of permanent brain damage increase with the length of attack. Aim to terminate seizures lasting more than a few minutes as soon as possible (<20min).

Status usually occurs in patients with known epilepsy. If it is the 1st presentation, the chance of a structural brain lesion is high (>50%). Diagnosis of tonic-clonic status is usually clear. Non-convulsive status (eg absence status or continuous partial seizures with preservation of consciousness) may be more difficult: look for subtle eye or lid movement. For other signs, see pp484, 490-3. An EEG can be very helpful. Could the patient be pregnant (any pelvic mass)? If so, eclampsia (OHCS p48) is the likely diagnosis, check the urine and BP: call a senior obstetrician—immediate delivery may be needed.

### Investigations
- Bedside glucose, the following tests can be done once ℞ has started: lab glucose, ABG, U&E, Ca²⁺, FBC, ECG.
- Consider anticonvulsant levels, toxicology screen, LP, culture blood and urine, EEG, CT, carbon monoxide level.
- Pulse oximetry, cardiac monitor.

### Management See fig 19.20. Basic life support—and these agents:¹⁴
1. **Lorazepam**: 0.1mg/kg (usually 4mg) as a slow bolus into a large vein. If no response after 10-20min give a second dose. Beware respiratory arrest during the last part of the injection. Have full resuscitation facilities to hand for all IV benzodiazepine use. The rectal route is an alternative for diazepam if IV access is difficult. Buccal midazolam is an easier to use oral alternative where no IV access (eg in a community setting); dose for those 10yrs old and older 10mg; if 1-5yrs 5mg, if 5-10yrs 7.5mg; squirt half the volume between the lower gum and the cheek on each side. While waiting for this to work, prepare other drugs. If fits continue ...

2. **Phenytoin infusion**: 15-18mg/kg IVI (roughly 1g if 60kg, and 1.5g if 80kg; max 2g), at a maximum rate of 50mg/min (don't put diazepam in same line: they don't mix). Beware BP and do not use if bradycardic or heart block. Requires BP and ECG monitoring. 100mg/6-8h is a maintenance dose (check levels). If fits continue ...

3. **Seek ICU help**: Paralysis and anaesthesia with eg propofol is required. Close monitoring, especially respiratory function, is vital. Consider whether this could be pseudoseizures (p490), particularly if there are odd features (pelvic thrusts; resisting attempts to open lids and your attempts to do passive movements; arms and legs flailing around).

4. **Dexamethasone**: 10mg IV if vasculitis/cerebral oedema (tumour) possible.

As soon as seizures are controlled, start oral drugs (p492). Ask what the cause was, eg hypoglycaemia, pregnancy, alcohol, drugs, CNS lesion or infection, hypertensive encephalopathy, inadequate anticonvulsant dose/compliance (p490).
