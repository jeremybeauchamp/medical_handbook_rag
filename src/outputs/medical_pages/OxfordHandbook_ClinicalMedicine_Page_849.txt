# Management plan for thyrotoxic storm

1. IV access, fluids if dehydrated. NG tube if vomiting

2. Take blood for: T3, T4, TSH, cultures (if infection suspected)

3. Sedate if necessary (eg chlorpromazine 50mg PO/IM). Monitor BP

4. If no contraindication, and cardiac output OK, give propranolol 60mg/4-6h PO; max IV dose: 1mg over 10min; may need repeating every few hours. In asthma/poor cardiac output, propranolol has caused cardiac arrest in thyroid storm, so ultra-short-acting β-blockers have a role, eg IV esmolol. Consider diltiazem if β-blockers contraindicated. **Get help**

5. High-dose digoxin may be needed to slow the heart, but ensure adequately β-blocked, give with cardiac monitoring

6. Antithyroid drugs: carbimazole 15-25mg/6h PO (or via NGT); after 4h give Lugol's solution (aqueous iodine oral solution) 0.3mL/8h PO well diluted in water for 7-10d to block thyroid

7. Hydrocortisone 100mg/6h IV or dexamethasone 2mg/6h PO to prevent peripheral conversion T4 to T3

8. Treat suspected infection, eg with co-amoxiclav 1.2g/8h IV

9. Adjust IV fluids as necessary; cool with tepid sponging ± paracetamol

10. Continuing treatment: After 5d reduce carbimazole to 15mg/8h PO. After 10d stop propranolol and iodine. Adjust carbimazole (p218)
