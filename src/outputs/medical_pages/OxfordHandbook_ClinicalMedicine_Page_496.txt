## Subdural haematoma

Consider this very treatable condition in all whose conscious level fluctuates, and also in those having an 'evolving stroke', especially if on anticoagulants. Bleeding is from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses (vulnerable to deceleration injury), resulting in accumulating haematoma between dura and arachnoid. This gradually raises ICP, shifting midline structures away from the side of the clot and, if untreated, eventual tentorial herniation and coning. Most subdurals are from trauma but the trauma is often forgotten as it was so minor or so long ago (up to 9 months). It can also occur without trauma (eg ↑ICP; dural metastases). The elderly are most susceptible, as brain atrophy makes bridging veins vulnerable. Other risk factors: falls (epileptics, alcoholics); anticoagulation.

**Symptoms** Fluctuating level of consciousness (seen in 35%) ± insidious physical or intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change, and unsteadiness.

**Signs** ↑ICP (p830), seizures. Localizing neurological symptoms (eg unequal pupils, hemiparesis) occur late, often >1 month after the injury.

**Differentials** Stroke, dementia, CNS masses (eg tumours, abscesses).

**Imaging** (fig 10.22) CT/MRI shows clot ± midline shift (but beware bilateral isodense clots). Look for crescent-shaped collection of blood over 1 hemisphere. The sickle-shape differentiates subdural blood from extradural haemorrhage.

**Management** Reverse clotting abnormalities urgently. Surgical management depends on the size of the clot, its chronicity, and the clinical picture: generally those >10mm or with midline shift >5mm need evacuating (via craniotomy or burr hole washout). Address the cause of the trauma (eg falls, abuse).

## Extradural (epidural) haematoma

Beware deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced no loss of consciousness or after initial drowsiness post injury seems to have resolved. This lucid interval pattern is typical of extradural bleeds.

**Cause** Suspect after any traumatic skull fracture. Often due to a fractured temporal or parietal bone causing laceration of the middle meningeal artery and vein, typically after trauma to a temple just lateral to the eye. Any tear in a dural venous sinus will also result in an extradural bleed. Blood accumulates between bone and dura.

**Clinical features** The lucid interval may last a few hours to a few days before a bleed declares itself by ↓GCS from rising ICP. Increasingly severe headache, vomiting, confusion, and seizures follow, ± hemiparesis with brisk reflexes and an up-going plantar. If bleeding continues, the ipsilateral pupil dilates, coma deepens, bilateral limb weakness develops, and breathing becomes deep and irregular (brainstem compression). Death follows a period of coma and is due to respiratory arrest. Bradycardia and ↑BP are late signs.

**Differentials** Epilepsy, carotid dissection, carbon monoxide poisoning.

**Tests** CT (fig 10.23) shows a haematoma (often biconvex/lens-shaped; the blood forms a more rounded shape compared with the sickle-shaped subdural haematoma as the tough dural attachments to the skull keep it more localized). Skull X-ray may be normal or show fracture lines crossing the course of the middle meningeal vessels. Lumbar puncture is contraindicated.

**Management** Stabilize and transfer urgently (with skilled medical and nursing escorts) to a neurosurgical unit for clot evacuation ± ligation of the bleeding vessel. Care of the airway in an unconscious patient and measures to ↓ICP often require intubation and ventilation (+ mannitol IVI, p831).

**Prognosis** Excellent if diagnosis and operation early. Poor if coma, pupil abnormalities, or decerebrate rigidity are present pre-op.
