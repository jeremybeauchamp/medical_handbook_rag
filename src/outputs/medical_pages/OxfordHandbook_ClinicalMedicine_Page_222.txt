# Treating diabetes mellitus

## General
Focus on education and lifestyle advice (eg exercise to ↑insulin sensitivity), healthy eating: p244—↓saturated fats, ↓sugar, ↑starch-carbohydrate, moderate protein. Foods made just for diabetics are not needed. One could regard bariatric surgery as a cure for DM in selected patients. Be prepared to negotiate HbA1c target and review every 3-6 months. Assess global vascular risk; start a high-intensity statin (p115), eg atorvastatin as tolerated, control BP (p211). Give foot-care (p212). (Pre-) pregnancy care should be in a multidisciplinary clinic (OHCS p23). Advise informing DVLA and not to drive if hypoglycaemic spells (p159; loss of hypoglycaemia awareness may lead to loss of licence; permanent if HGV).

## Type 1 DM
Insulin (see BOX 'Using insulin').

## Type 2 DM
See fig 5.5.

## Oral hypoglycaemic agents

**Metformin:** A biguanide. ↑ insulin sensitivity and helps weight. SE: nausea; diarrhoea (try modified-release version); abdominal pain; not hypoglycaemia. Avoid if eGFR ≤36mL/min (due to risk lactic acidosis).

**DPP4 inhibitors/gliptins:** (Eg sitagliptin.) Block the action of DPP-4, an enzyme which destroys the hormone incretin.

**Glitazone:** ↑ insulin sensitivity; SE: hypoglycaemia, fractures, fluid retention, ↑LFT (do LFT every 8wks for 1yr, stop if ALT up >3-fold). CI: past or present CCF; osteoporosis; monitor weight, and stop if ↑ or oedema.

**Sulfonylurea:** ↑ insulin secretion; eg gliclazide 40mg/d. SE: hypoglycaemia (monitor glucose); it ↑ weight.

**SGLTI:** Selective sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Blocks the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys and promotes excretion of excess glucose in the urine (eg empagliflozin, shown to reduce mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 DM, when compared to placebo).
