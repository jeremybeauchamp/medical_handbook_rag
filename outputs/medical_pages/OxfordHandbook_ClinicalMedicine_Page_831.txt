    A[Assess using ABC:<br>Treat hypoxia sats <88% with oxygen,<br>start at 24-28% if history COPD/hypercapnia]
    B[Treat hypotension/shock from infection: see p790<br>Assess for dehydration common if acutely unwell<br>and fever, consider IV fluid support]
    C[Investigations:<br>See p816]
    D[Antibiotics:<br>See p167]
    E[Analgesia for pleuritic chest pain, eg paracetamol 1g/6h or NSAID]
    F[No improvement?<br>If hypoxic despite oxygen, consider CPAP to recruit lung paren-<br>chyma and improve oxygenation. But if patient is hypercapnic,<br>they will require non-invasive or invasive ie intubation ventilation<br>Discuss with ICU early if patient has rising PaCO2 or remains<br>hypoxic despite best medical therapy]
