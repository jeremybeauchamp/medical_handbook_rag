# Bladder tumours

>90% are transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) in the UK. Adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are rare in the West (the latter may follow schistosomiasis). UK incidence ≈ 1:6000/yr. ♂:♀≈5:2. Histology is important for prognosis: Grade 1—differentiated; Grade 2—intermediate; Grade 3—poorly differentiated. 80% are confined to bladder mucosa, and only ~20% penetrate muscle (increasing mortality to 50% at 5yrs).

## Presentation
Painless haematuria; recurrent UTIs; voiding irritability.

## Associations
Smoking; aromatic amines (rubber industry); chronic cystitis; schistosomiasis (↑risk of squamous cell carcinoma); pelvic irradiation.

## Tests
- Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic.
- Urine: microscopy/cytology (cancers may cause sterile pyuria).
- CT urogram is both diagnostic and provides staging.
- Bimanual EUA helps assess spread.
- MRI or lymphangiography may show involved pelvic nodes.

## Staging
See table 13.19.

## Treating TCC of the bladder
- Tis/Ta/T1: (80% of all patients) Diathermy via transurethral cystoscopy/transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Consider a regimen of intravesical BCG (which stimulates a non-specific immune response) for multiple small tumours or high-grade tumours. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include mitomycin, epirubicin and gemcitabine. 5yr survival ≈ 95%.
- T2–3: Radical cystectomy is the 'gold standard'. Radiotherapy gives worse 5yr survival rates than surgery, but preserves the bladder. 'Salvage' cystectomy can be performed if radiotherapy fails, but yields worse results than primary surgery. Post-op chemotherapy (eg M-VAC: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) is toxic but effective. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC or GC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or radiotherapy alone. Methods to preserve the bladder with transurethral resection or partial cystectomy + systemic chemotherapy have been tried, but long-term results are disappointing. If the bladder neck is not involved, orthotopic reconstruction rather than forming a urostoma is an option (both using ~40cm of the patient's ileum), but adequate tumour clearance must not be compromised. ▶ The patient should have all these options explained by a urologist and an oncologist.
- T4: Usually palliative chemo/radiotherapy. Chronic catheterization and urinary diversions may help to relieve pain.

## Follow-up
History, examination, and regular cystoscopy: 
- High-risk tumours: Every 3 months for 2yrs, then every 6 months. 
- Low-risk tumours: First follow-up cystoscopy after 9 months, then yearly.

## Tumour spread
Local → to pelvic structures; lymphatic → to iliac and para-aortic nodes; haematogenous → to liver and lungs.

## Survival
This depends on age at surgery. For example, the 3yr survival after cystectomy for T2 and T3 tumours is 60% if 65-75yrs old, falling to 40% if 75-82yrs old (operative mortality is 4%). With unilateral pelvic node involvement, only 6% of patients survive 5yrs. The 3yr survival with bilateral or para-aortic node involvement is nil.

## Complications
Cystectomy can result in sexual and urinary malfunction. Massive bladder haemorrhage may complicate treatment or be a feature of disease treated palliatively. Determining the cause of bleeding is key. Consider alum solution bladder irrigation (if no renal failure) as 1st-line treatment for intractable haematuria in advanced malignancy: it is an inpatient procedure.
