## Osteoarthritis (OA)

Osteoarthritis is the most common joint condition worldwide, with a clinically significant impact on >10% of persons aged >60 years. It is usually primary (generalized), but may be secondary to joint disease or other conditions (eg haemochromatosis, obesity, occupational).

### Signs and symptoms
**Localized disease** (often knee or hip): Pain and crepitus on movement, with background ache at rest. Worse with prolonged activity. Joints may 'gel' (brief stiffness after rest, usually 10-15 minutes or so). Joints may feel unstable, with a perceived lack of power due to pain. **Generalized disease**: 'Nodal OA' (typically DIP, PIP, CMC joints, and knees in post-menopausal females). There may be joint tenderness, derangement and bony swelling (Heberden's at DIP and Bouchard's at PIP), reduced range of movement and mild synovitis. Assess effect of symptoms on occupation, family duties, hobbies, and lifestyle expectations.

### Tests
Plain radiographs show: Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subarticular sclerosis and Subchondral cysts (fig 12.4 p541). CRP may be slightly elevated.

### Management
**Core treatments**: Exercise to improve local muscle strength and general aerobic fitness (irrespective of age, severity, or comorbidity). Weight loss if overweight. **Analgesia**: Regular paracetamol ± topical NSAIDs. If ineffective use codeine or short-term oral NSAID (+PPI)—see BOX. Topical capsaicin (derived from chillies) may help. Intra-articular steroid injections temporarily relieve pain in severe symptoms. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections (viscosupplementation) are not NICE approved. Glucosamine and chondroitin products are not recommended, although patients may try them if they wish (can be bought over the counter). **Non-pharmacological**: Use a multidisciplinary approach, including physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Try heat or cold packs at the site of pain, walking aids, stretching/manipulation or TENS. **Surgery**: Joint replacement (hips, or knees) is the best way to deal with severe OA that has a substantial impact on quality of life.

## Septic arthritis

Consider septic arthritis in any acutely inflamed joint, as it can destroy a joint in under 24h and has a mortality rate up to 11%. Inflammation may be less overt if immunocompromised (eg from medication) or if there is underlying joint disease. The knee is affected in >50% cases.

### Risk factors
Pre-existing joint disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis); diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, chronic renal failure, recent joint surgery, prosthetic joints (where infection is particularly difficult to treat), IV drug abuse, age >80yrs.

### Investigations
Urgent joint aspiration for synovial fluid microscopy and culture is the key investigation (p541), as plain radiographs and CRP may be normal. The main differential diagnoses are the crystal arthropathies (p548). Blood cultures are essential (prior to antibiotics).

**Ask yourself** 'How did the organism get there?' Is there immunosuppression, or another focus of infection, eg from indwelling IV lines, infected skin, or pneumonia (present in up to 50% of those with pneumococcal arthritis)?

### Treatment
If in doubt start empirical IV antibiotics (after aspiration) until sensitivities are known. Common causative organisms are Staph. aureus, streptococci, Neisseria gonococcus, and Gram -ve bacilli. Follow local guidelines for antibiotic choice and contact microbiology for advice for all complex cases/immunosuppressed patients (eg HIV). Consider flucloxacillin 2g QDS IV (clindamycin if penicillin allergic); Vancomycin IV plus 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin, eg cefuroxime if MRSA risk; 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin if Gram -ve organisms suspected. For suspected gonococcus or meningococcus, consider ceftriaxone. Antibiotics are required for a prolonged period, conventionally ~2 weeks IV, then if patient improving 2-4 weeks PO. Consider orthopaedic review for arthrocentesis, washout, and debridement; always urgently refer patients with prosthetic joint involvement.
