# Taking arterial blood gas (ABG) samples

Having an artery sampled is more unpleasant for the patient than venepuncture: explain that it is going to feel different and is for a different purpose (p162 for indications and analysis). The usual site is the radial artery at the wrist.

> Check with the patient that they do not have an arterio-venous fistula for haemodialysis. Never, ever sample from a fistula.

## Procedure:
- Get kit ready; include: portable sharps bin; pre-heparinized syringe; needle (blue size (23G) is good, although many syringes now come pre-made with needle); gloves; 2% chlorhexidine/70% alcohol swab; gauze; tape.
- Feel thoroughly for the best site. Look at both sides.
- Wipe with cleaning swab. Let the area dry. Get yourself comfortable.
- If the patient is drowsy or unconscious, ask an assistant to hold the hand and arm with the wrist slightly extended (fig 18.12).
- Before sampling, expel any excess heparin in the syringe. Infiltration over the artery with a small amount of 1% lidocaine (p573) through a 25G (orange) needle makes the procedure painless.
- Hold the syringe like a pen, with the needle bevel up. Let the patient know you are about to take the sample. Feel for the pulse with your other hand and enter at 45Â°, aiming beneath the finger you are feeling with.
- In most syringes, the plunger will move up on its own in a pulsatile manner if you are in the artery; rarely, entry into a vein next to the artery will give a similar result. Colour of the blood is little guide to its source.
- Allow the syringe to fill with 1-2mL, then remove the needle and apply firm pressure for 5 minutes (10 if anticoagulated).
- Expel any air from the syringe as this will alter the oxygenation of the blood. Cap and label the sample, check the patient's temperature and FiO2 (0.21 if on air). Take the sample to the nearest analysis machine or send it by express delivery to the lab (which may be by your own feet, get someone else to apply pressure) as it should be analysed within 15 minutes of sampling.
- Syringes and analysis machines differ, so get familiar with the local nuances.

The other site that is amenable to ABG sampling is the femoral artery (fig 18.13). Surprisingly this may be less uncomfortable as it is a relatively less sensitive area and because, when supine, the patient cannot see the needle and thus may feel less apprehensive. The brachial artery can also be used, but be aware that the median nerve sits closely on its medial side and it is an end-artery. Normal values: p753.

| Fig 18.12 | The ideal position for the wrist, slightly hyperextended, resting on an unopened litre bag of fluid or a bandage is ideal. In an unconscious patient or for arterial line insertion, taping the thumb to the bed can hold the wrist in the perfect position if you do not have an assistant. |
