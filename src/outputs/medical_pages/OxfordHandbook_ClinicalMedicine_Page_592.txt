# Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

DVTs occur in 25-50% of surgical patients, and many non-surgical patients. All hospital inpatients should be assessed for DVT/PE risk and offered prophylaxis if appropriate. 65% of below-knee DVTs are asymptomatic; these rarely embolize to the lung.

**Risk factors** Age, pregnancy, synthetic oestrogen, trauma, surgery (especially pelvic/orthopaedic), past DVT, cancer, obesity, immobility, thrombophilia (p374).

**Signs** •Calf warmth/tenderness/swelling/erythema. •Mild fever. •Pitting oedema.

**DD** Cellulitis; ruptured Baker's cyst. Both may coexist with a DVT.

**Tests** Calculate Wells score (see table 13.5) before ordering D-dimer. D-dimer is sensitive but not specific for DVT (also ↑ in infection, pregnancy, malignancy, and post-op).

**Wells score:** ≤1 point = DVT unlikely: Perform D-dimer. If negative, DVT excluded. If positive, proceed to USS (if USS negative, DVT excluded; if positive, treat as DVT).

≥2 points = DVT likely: Do D-dimer and USS. If both negative, DVT excluded. If USS positive, treat as DVT. If D-dimer positive and USS negative, repeat USS in 1 week.

Do thrombophilia tests (p374) before commencing anticoagulant therapy if there are no predisposing factors, in recurrent DVT, or if DVT in unusual site. Look for underlying malignancy: Urine dip; FBC, LFT, Ca2+; CXR ± CT abdomen/pelvis (and mammography in ♀) if >40yrs.

**Prevention** •Stop the oral contraceptive pill 4wks pre-op. •Mobilize early. •LMWH eg enoxaparin 20mg/24h SC, ↑ to 40mg for high-risk patients (p375) (caution if eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73m2). •Graduated compression stockings ('thromboembolic deterrent (TED) stockings'; CI: ischaemia) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices ↓ risk of DVT by ~70% in surgical patients. •Fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor) ↓ risk of DVT over LMWH in eg major orthopaedic surgery without ↑ risk of bleeding.

**Treatment** LMWH (eg enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/24h SC) or fondaparinux. LMWH is superior to unfractionated heparin (used in renal failure or if risk of bleeding; dose guided by APTT, p350). Cancer patients should receive LMWH for 6 months (then review). In others, start warfarin simultaneously with LMWH (warfarin is prothrombotic for the first 48h). Stop heparin when INR is 2-3; treat for 3 months in most (longer in some cases—see p351). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs p190), eg dabigatran, apixaban, rivoraxaban, are newer alternatives licensed for the treatment of DVT with benefits relating to simpler dosing and monitoring and ↓ bleeding risk. Inferior vena caval filters may be used in active bleeding, or when anticoagulants fail, to minimize risk of PE. Post-phlebitic change (pain, swelling, and skin changes) can be seen in 10-30%—graduated compression stockings may help.

## Pretest clinical probability scoring for DVT: the Wells score

In patients with symptoms in both legs, the more symptomatic leg is used.

| Clinical features | Score |
|-------------------|-------|
| Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) | 1 point |
| Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of leg | 1 point |
| Recently bedridden for >3d or majory surgery in last 12wks | 1 point |
| Local tenderness along distribution of deep venous system | 1 point |
| Entire leg swollen | 1 point |
| Calf swelling >3cm compared with asymptomatic leg (measured 10cm below tibial tuberosity) | 1 point |
| Pitting oedema (greater in the symptomatic leg) | 1 point |
| Collateral superficial veins (non-varicose) | 1 point |
| Previously documented DVT | 1 point |
| Alternative diagnosis at least as likely as DVT | -2 points |
