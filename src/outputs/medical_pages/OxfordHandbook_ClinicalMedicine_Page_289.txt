## Prescribing in liver failure

Avoid drugs that constipate (risk of encephalopathy), oral hypoglycaemics, and saline-containing IVIs. Warfarin effects are enhanced. Hepatotoxic drugs include paracetamol, methotrexate, isoniazid, azathioprine, phenothiazines, oestrogen, 6-mercaptopurine, salicylates, tetracycline, mitomycin.

## Hepatic encephalopathy: letting loose some false neurotransmitters

As the liver fails, nitrogenous waste (as ammonia) builds up in the circulation and passes to the brain, where astrocytes clear it (by processes involving the conversion of glutamate to glutamine). This excess glutamine causes an osmotic imbalance and a shift of fluid into these cells—hence cerebral oedema. Grading:

I    Altered mood/behaviour; sleep disturbance (eg reversed sleep pattern); dyspraxia ('Please copy this 5-pointed star'); poor arithmetic. No liver flap.
II   Increasing drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech ± liver flap, inappropriate behaviour/personality change (ask the family—don't be too tactful).
III  Incoherent; restless; liver flap; stupor.
IV   Coma.

What else could be clouding consciousness? Hypoglycaemia; sepsis; trauma; postictal.

## What is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)?

Cirrhosis + ascites + renal failure ≈ HRS—if other causes of renal impairment have been excluded. Abnormal haemodynamics causes splanchnic and systemic vasodilation, but renal vasoconstriction. Bacterial translocation, cytokines, and mesenteric angiogenesis cause splanchnic vasodilation, and altered renal auto-regulation is involved in the renal vasoconstriction.

Types of HRS: HRS 1 is a rapidly progressive deterioration in circulatory and renal function (median survival <2wks), often triggered by other deteriorating pathologies. Terlipressin resists hypovolaemia. Haemodialysis may be needed. HRS 2 is a more steady deterioration (survival ~6 months). Transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic stent shunting may be required (TIPS, p257).

Other factors in cirrhosis may contribute to poor renal function (p277).

Transplants: Liver transplant may be required. After >8–12wks of pre-transplant dialysis, some may be considered for combined liver–kidney transplantation.

## King's College Hospital criteria in acute liver failure

| Paracetamol-induced liver failure | Non-paracetamol liver failure |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| • Arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion. | • PT >100s. |
| Or all of the following: | Or 3 out of 5 of the following: |
| • Prothrombin time (PT) >100s | 1 Drug-induced liver failure |
| • Creatinine >300μmol/L | 2 Age <10 or >40yrs old |
| • Grade III or IV encephalopathy. | 3 >1wk from 1st jaundice to encephalopathy |
| | 4 PT >50s |
| | 5 Bilirubin ≥300μmol/L. |

Fulfilling these criteria predicts poor outcome in acute liver failure and should prompt consideration for transplantation (p277).
