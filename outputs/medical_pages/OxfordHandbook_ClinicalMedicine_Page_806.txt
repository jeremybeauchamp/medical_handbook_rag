792 Sepsis

Sepsis is a major killer. There are >150 000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year resulting in >44 000 deaths, and much morbidity.

**Sepsis** Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

**Septic shock** Sepsis in combination with:
• EITHER lactate >2mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation
• OR the patient is requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65mmHg.

## Sepsis recognition

Many sepsis-related deaths could be prevented with earlier treatment. Often, the key failure in sepsis management is not recognizing sepsis in time. Early warning scores (p892, fig A1) help identify inpatients who are becoming septic.

Have a low threshold for assessing for sepsis if:
• the patient has communication difficulties: limited English; limited verbal communication; cognitive impairment
• the patient is immunosuppressed, on chemotherapy, or an IV drug user
• the patient recently had surgery or is pregnant/recently gave birth
• the patient has indwelling lines/other foreign material.

## Assessing risk in sepsis

Table 19.3 Risk criteria in sepsis

| Moderate- to high-risk criteria | High-risk criteria |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Reports of altered mental state or acute deterioration in functional status | Objective evidence of altered mental state |
| Respiratory rate (RR) 21-24 | RR>24; new requirement for FiO2 >40% to keep sats >92% (>88% in COPD) |
| Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 91-100mmHg | SBP <90 or >40mmHg less than baseline |
| Heart rate 91-130bpm or new arrhythmia | Heart rate >130bpm |
| Urine output: nil for 12-18h; 0.5-1.0mL/kg/h if catheterized | Urine output: nil for 18h; <0.5mL/kg/h if catheterized |
| Local signs of infection, incl. redness, swelling, or discharge around wound | Mottled, ashen, or cyanotic skin. Non-blanching rash (p822) |
| Rigors, or temperature <36°C | |
| Impaired immunity (illness or drugs) | |
| Recent surgery/trauma/invasive procedure | |

When there is a suspicion of sepsis, the criteria in table 19.3 are used to assess the patient's risk of death or serious illness from sepsis as follows:

**High risk:** At least one high-risk criterion OR at least two moderate- to high-risk criteria with AKI or LACTATE >2.

**Moderate to high risk:** At least one moderate- to high-risk criterion.

**Low risk:** No moderate- or high-risk criteria.

## Acute management in sepsis
Early recognition and treatment is key. See fig 19.3.2

**Antibiotics:** These should be broad spectrum and start within 1h. Consider covering for non-bacterial microbes, eg give aciclovir if HSV encephalitis is suspected.

**Fluids:** Give within 1h if high risk with SBP <90, AKI, or lactate >2 (consider if <2).
• Give 500mL boluses of crystalloids with 130-154mmol/L sodium (eg 0.9% saline) over 15mins. Caution in heart failure.
• If no improvement after two boluses, speak with a senior.

**Oxygen:** Give oxygen as required for target saturations. These will be 94-98% (or 88-92% if the patient is at risk of CO2 retention, eg in severe COPD).

**Critical care review:** Speak with critical care early if intensive care support (eg inotropes, ventilation, haemofiltration, intensive monitoring) may be required.

**Surgical involvement:** Eg emergency wound debridement.

**Manage acute complications:** Shock (p790), AKI (p298), DIC (p352), ARDS (p186), arrhythmias (may spontaneously resolve when sepsis improves).
