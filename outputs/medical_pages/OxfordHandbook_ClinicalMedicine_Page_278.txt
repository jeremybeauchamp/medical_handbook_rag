# Crohn's disease

A chronic inflammatory disease characterized by transmural granulomatous inflammation affecting any part of the gut from mouth to anus (esp. terminal ileum in ~70%). Unlike UC, there is unaffected bowel between areas of active disease (skip lesions). 

**Cause** As with UC an inappropriate immune response against the (?abnormal) gut flora in a genetically susceptible individual.¹⁹ **Prevalence** 100-200/100 000. **Incidence** 10-20/100 000/yr; typically presents ~20-40yrs. **Associations** Smoking risk x3-4; NSAIDS may exacerbate disease.

**Symptoms** Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss/failure to thrive. Systemic symptoms: fatigue, fever, malaise, anorexia.

**Signs** Bowel ulceration (fig 6.22); abdominal tenderness/mass; perianal abscess/fistulae/skin tags; anal strictures. Beyond the gut: (fig 6.21) Clubbing, skin, joint, & eye problems.

**Complications** Small bowel obstruction; toxic dilatation (colonic diameter >6cm, toxic dilatation is rarer than in UC); abscess formation (abdominal, pelvic, or perianal); fistulae (present in ~10%), eg entero-enteric, colovesical (bladder), colovaginal, perianal, enterocutaneous; perforation; colon cancer; PSC (p282), malnutrition.

**Tests** 
- *Blood:* FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT, INR, ferritin, TIBC, B₁₂, folate. 
- *Stool:* MC&S and CDT (p258) to exclude eg C. difficile, Campylobacter, E. coli; faecal calprotectin is a simple, non-invasive test for GI inflammation with high sensitivity. 
- *Colonoscopy + biopsy:* Even if mucosa looks normal. 
- *Small bowel:* To detect isolated proximal disease by eg capsule endoscopy (p248, use dummy patency capsule 1st that disintegrates if it gets stuck); MRI increasingly used to assess pelvic disease and fistulae, small bowel disease activity and strictures; US in skilled hands can provide small bowel imaging.

**Treatment** (See BOX.¹) Find out how your patient deals with what may be a brutal disease (no intimacy...no sex...no hope...'I live with this alone and will die alone'). With a collaborative approach, courage, attention to detail, and a dose of humour, this can change. Help quit smoking. ▶Optimize nutrition. Assess severity: T°, pulse, ESR, WCC, CRP, + albumin may merit admission for IV steroids.

*Mild-moderate:* Symptomatic but systemically well. Prednisolone 40mg/d PO for 1wk, then taper by 5mg every wk for next 7wks. An alternative dietary approach based upon 'elemental' or 'polymeric' diets is effective in children but less used for adults. Plan maintenance therapy (see BOX).

*Severe:* Admit for IV hydration/electrolyte replacement; IV steroids, eg hydrocortisone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h; thromboembolism prophylaxis (p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection.
- Monitor T°, pulse, BP, and record stool frequency/character on a stool chart.
- Physical examination daily. Daily FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, and plain AXR.
- Consider need for blood transfusion (if Hb <80g/L) and nutritional support.
- If improving switch to oral prednisolone (40mg/d). If not, biologics have a role.
- Consider abdominal sepsis complicating Crohn's disease especially if abdominal pain (ultrasound, CT, & MRI are often required to assess this). Seek surgical advice.

*Perianal disease:* Occurs in about 50%. MRI and examination under anaesthetic (EUA) are an important part of assessment. Treatment includes oral antibiotics, immunosuppressant therapy ± anti-TNFα, and local surgery ± seton insertion.

¹⁹ Much of the genetic risk is shared with UC—small differences in genetics combined with environmental modifiers may explain the very different phenotypes.
