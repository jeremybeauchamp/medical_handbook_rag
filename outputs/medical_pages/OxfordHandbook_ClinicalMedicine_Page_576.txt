# Skin manifestations of systemic diseases

## Erythema nodosum (fig 12.21)
Painful, blue-red, raised lesions on shins (± thighs/arms). Causes: sarcoidosis, drugs (sulfonamides, contraceptive pill, dapsone), streptococcal infection. Less common: IBD, BCG vaccination, leptospirosis, Mycobacterium (TB, leprosy), Yersinia, or various viruses and fungi. Cause unknown in 30-50%.

## Erythema multiforme (See OHCS p588.) (fig 12.22)
'Target' lesions: symmetrical ± central blister, on palms/soles, limbs, and elsewhere. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (p710): a rare, severe variant with fever and mucosal involvement (mouth, genital, and eye ulcers), associated with a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (NSAIDs, sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, allopurinol), or infections (herpes, Mycoplasma, orf). Also seen in collagen disorders. 50% of cases are idiopathic. Get expert help in severe disease.

## Erythema migrans (fig 12.23)
Presents as a small papule at the site of a tick bite which develops into a spreading large erythematous ring, with central fading. It lasts from 48h to 3 months and there may be multiple lesions in disseminated disease. Cause: the rash is pathognomonic of Lyme disease and occurs in ~80% of cases (p422).

## Erythema marginatum
Pink coalescent rings on trunk which come and go. It is seen in rheumatic fever (or rarely other causes, eg drugs). See fig 3.42, p143.

## Pyoderma gangrenosum (fig 12.24)
Recurring nodulo-pustular ulcers, ~10cm wide, with tender red/blue overhanging necrotic edge, purulent surface, and healing with cribriform scars on leg, abdomen, or face. Associations: IBD, autoimmune hepatitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), myeloma, neoplasia. ♂>♀. Treatment: get help. Oral steroids ± ciclosporin should be 1st-line therapy.64

## Vitiligo (fig 12.25)
Vitellus is Latin for spotted calf: typically white patches ± hyperpigmented borders. Sunlight makes them itch. Associations: autoimmune disorders; premature ovarian failure. Treat by camouflage cosmetics and sunscreens (± steroid creams ± dermabrasion). UK Vitiligo Society: 0800 018 2631.

# Specific diseases and their skin manifestations

## Crohn's
Perianal/vulval/oral ulcers; erythema nodosum; pyoderma gangrenosum.

## Dermatomyositis
Gottron's papules (rough red papules on the knuckles/extensor surfaces); shawl sign; heliotrope rash on eyelids (fig 12.26). It may be associated with lung, bowel, ovarian, or pancreatic malignancy (p552).

## Diabetes mellitus
Ulcers, necrobiosis lipoidica (shiny yellowish area on shin ± telangiectasia; fig 12.27), granuloma annulare (OHCS p586), acanthosis nigricans (pigmented, rough thickening of axillary, neck, or groin skin with warty lesions; fig 12.28).

## Coeliac disease
Dermatitis herpetiformis: Itchy blisters, in groups on knees, elbows, and scalp. The itch (which can drive patients to suicide) responds to dapsone 25-200mg/24h PO within 48h—and this may be used as a diagnostic test. The maintenance dose may be as little as 50mg/wk. A gluten-free diet should be adhered to, but in 30% dapsone will need to be continued. SE (dose-related): haemolysis (CI: anaemia, G6PD-deficiency), hepatitis, agranulocytosis (monitor FBC and LFTs). There is an ↑ risk of small bowel lymphoma with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis—so surveillance is needed.

## Hyperthyroidism
Pretibial myxoedema: Red oedematous swellings above lateral malleoli, progressing to thickened oedema of legs and feet, thyroid acropachy—clubbing + subperiosteal new bone in phalanges. Other endocrinopathies: p203.

## Liver disease
Palmar erythema; spider naevi; gynaecomastia; decrease in pubic hair; jaundice; bruising; scratch marks.

## Malabsorption
Dry pigmented skin, easy bruising, hair loss, leuconychia.

## Neoplasia
Acanthosis nigricans: (See 'Diabetes mellitus' and fig 12.28.) Associated with gastric cancer. Dermatomyositis: see earlier in topic. Thrombophlebitis migrans: Successive crops of tender nodules affecting blood vessels throughout the body, associated with pancreatic cancer (especially body and tail). Acquired ichthyosis: Dry scaly skin associated with lymphoma. Skin metastases: Especially melanoma, and colonic, lung, breast, laryngeal/oral, or ovarian malignancy.
