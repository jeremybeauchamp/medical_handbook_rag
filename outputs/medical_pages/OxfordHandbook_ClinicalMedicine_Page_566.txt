## Autoimmune connective tissue diseases

Included under this heading are SLE (p554), systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome (p710), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (myositis—see following topic), mixed connective tissue disease, relapsing polychondritis, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease and overlap syndromes. They overlap with each other, affect many organ systems, and often require immunosuppressive therapies (p376). Consider as a differential in unwell patients with multi-organ involvement, especially if no infection.

### Systemic sclerosis
Features scleroderma (skin fibrosis), internal organ fibrosis, and microvascular abnormalities. Severe cases have a 40-50% mortality at 5 years. 90% are ANA positive and 30-40% have anticentromere antibodies (see BOX). Skin disease is limited or diffuse. Limited involves the face, hands, and feet (formally CREST syndrome). It is associated with anticentromere antibodies in 70-80%. Pulmonary hypertension is often present subclinically, and can become rapidly life-threatening, so should be looked for (℞: sildenafil, bosentan). Diffuse can involve the whole body. Antitopoisomerase-1 (SCL-70) antibodies in 40% and anti-RNA polymerase in 20%. Prognosis is often poor. Control BP meticulously. Perform annual echocardiogram and spirometry. Both limited and diffuse have the potential for organ fibrosis: lung, cardiac, GI, and renal (p314) but this occurs later in limited sub-set.

#### Management:
Currently no cure. Immunosuppressive regimens, including IV cyclophosphamide, are used for organ involvement or progressive skin disease. Trials of antifibrotic tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing. Monitor BP and renal function. Regular ACE-i or A2RBs ↑ risk of renal crisis (p314). Raynaud's phenomenon: (see p708).

### Mixed connective tissue disease
Combines features of systemic sclerosis, SLE, and polymyositis and the presence of high titres of anti-U1-RNP antibodies.

### Relapsing polychondritis
Rare condition with recurrent episodes of cartilage inflammation and destruction. Affects pinna (floppy ears), nasal septum, larynx (stridor), tracheobronchial tree (infections), and joints. Associations: Aortic valve disease, polyarthritis, and vasculitis. 30% have underlying rheumatic or autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is clinical. ℞: Steroids, DMARDs or CPAP/tracheostomy for airway involvement.

## Polymyositis and dermatomyositis

Rare conditions characterized by insidious onset of progressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and autoimmune-mediated striated muscle inflammation (myositis), associated with myalgia ± arthralgia. Muscle weakness may also cause dysphagia, dysphonia (ie poor phonation, not dysphasia), or respiratory weakness. The myositis (esp. in dermatomyositis) may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, commonly from lung, pancreatic, ovarian, or bowel malignancy. Screen for cancers.

### Dermatomyositis
Myositis plus skin signs:
- Macular rash (shawl sign is +ve if over back and shoulders).
- Lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids often with oedema (fig 12.26, p563).
- Nailfold erythema (dilated capillary loops).
- Gottron's papules: roughened red papules over the knuckles, also seen on elbows and knees (pathognomonic if CK + muscle weakness). Malignancy in 30% cases.

### Extra-muscular signs
In both conditions include fever, arthralgia, Raynaud's, interstitial lung fibrosis and myocardial involvement (myocarditis, arrhythmias).

### Tests
Muscle enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, CK, & aldolase) ↑ in plasma; EMG shows characteristic fibrillation potentials; muscle biopsy confirms diagnosis (and excludes mimicking conditions). MRI shows muscle oedema in acute myositis. Autoantibody associations: (see BOX) anti-Mi2, anti-Jo1—associated with acute onset and interstitial lung fibrosis that should be treated aggressively.

### Differential diagnoses
Carcinomatous myopathy, inclusion-body myositis, muscular dystrophy, PMR, endocrine/metabolic myopathy (eg steroids), rhabdomyolysis, infection (eg HIV), drugs (penicillamine, colchicine, statins, or chloroquine).

### Management
Start prednisolone. Immunosuppressives (p376) and cytotoxics are used early in resistant cases. Hydroxychloroquine/topical tacrolimus for skin disease.
