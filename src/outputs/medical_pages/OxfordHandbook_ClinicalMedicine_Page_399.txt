# Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis

See fig 9.4. The bacterial cell wall is unique in nature and therefore acts as a selective target for antibiotics. Antibiotics which act on the cell wall include:
- β-lactam antibiotics
- others: glycopeptides, polymyxins.

## β-lactams: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam

Contain a β-lactam ring which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. Resistance occurs when the bacteria (eg staphylococci) produce a β-lactamase enzyme.

### Penicillins:

See table 9.3. Include natural penicillins (penicillin G and V) and synthetic penicillins which are chemically modified to extend their spectrum of activity, eg amoxicillin, piperacillin.

In an attempt to overcome β-lactamase resistance, penicillins have been combined with β-lactamase inhibitors to create β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations eg co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin+clavulanic acid), Tazocin® (piperacillin+tazobactam).

Staphylococcal resistance is conventionally defined by stability to meticillin, an acid-labile and IV-only equivalent of flucloxacillin (see MRSA p388).

### Cephalosporins:

See table 9.4. Contain a β-lactam ring attached to a six-membered nuclear structure (five in penicillin), which allows synthetic modification at two sites (one in penicillin). This means that cephalosporins are the largest groups of available antibiotics. Classification into 'generations' is not standardized: as a rough rule, the higher the generation, the wider the spectrum.

### Carbapenems:

See table 9.5. Broadest spectrum of all β-lactam antibiotics. Seek expert microbiology advice before use.

### Monobactam:

Aztreonam is only active against Gram-negative species including Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas. Given IV/IM. Inhaled preparation for chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas (cystic fibrosis). Dose adjust for renal function. SEs: N&V, GI bleed, rash, LFTs, ↑plts, paraesthesia, seizures, bronchospasm.

## Non-β-lactam cell wall inhibitors

See fig 9.4 and table 9.6. Includes glycopeptides, eg vancomycin, teicoplanin, and polymyxins, eg colistin.

# Inhibitors of protein synthesis

See fig 9.4 and table 9.7. Includes:
- aminoglycosides
- macrolides
- tetracyclines and derivatives of tetracycline
- others: clindamycin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid.

# Inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis

See fig 9.4 and table 9.8. Includes:
- folate synthesis inhibitors: trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole
- fluoroquinolones
- others: metronidazole, rifampicin.

Nitrofurantoin is unique. Metabolites interfere with cell growth via ribosomes, DNA, RNA, and cell wall. Multiple sites of attack means ↓resistance. Concentrates in the urine (but not if ↓GFR), used in uncomplicated UTI. SEs: haemolysis, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity.
