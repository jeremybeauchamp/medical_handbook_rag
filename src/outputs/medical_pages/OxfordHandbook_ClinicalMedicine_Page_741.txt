Fig 16.7 Knowing where lines and tubes should be placed is an essential skill. An ET tube (orange) should sit 3-7cm above the carina; this one is slightly high. The tip of the CVC (red, here a right internal jugular line) should lie in the SVC, as seen here, or just in the right atrium. The tip of the NG tube (green) must be seen below the diaphragm to ensure it is placed in the oesophagus, not the trachea. Do not confuse external leads (blue) with internal lines.

X-ray image of chest with colored lines indicating tube placements

| Tube/Line | Color | Correct Placement |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| ET tube | Orange | 3-7cm above the carina |
| CVC (Central Venous Catheter) | Red | In the SVC or just in the right atrium |
| NG tube (Nasogastric tube) | Green | Below the diaphragm in the oesophagus |
| External leads | Blue | Across the chest (not to be confused with internal lines) |

Note: The images show chest X-rays taken in the ICU setting, demonstrating the placement of various medical tubes and lines. The second image uses color coding to highlight the different tubes and their ideal positions within the body.
