# The 8-hour water deprivation test

Tests the ability of kidneys to concentrate urine for diagnosis of DI (dilute urine in spite of dehydration), and then to localize the cause (table 5.5). Do not do the test before establishing that urine volume is >3L/d (output less than this with normal plasma Na+ and osmolality excludes significant disturbance of water balance).

- Stop test if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 (DI is excluded).
- Free fluids until 07.30. Light breakfast at 06.30, no tea, no coffee, no smoking.

## Stage 1 Fluid deprivation (0-8h): for diagnosis of DI. Start at 08.00.

- Empty bladder, then no drinks and only dry food.
- Weigh hourly. If >3% weight lost during test, order urgent serum osmolality. If >300mOsmol/kg, proceed to Stage 2. If <300, continue test.
- Collect urine every 2h; measure its volume and osmolality.
- Venous sample for osmolality every 4h.
- Stop test after 8h (16.00) if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg (ie normal).

## Stage 2 Differentiate cranial from nephrogenic DI.

- Proceed if urine still diluteâ€”ie urine osmolality <600mOsmol/kg.
- Give desmopressin 2mcg IM. Water can be drunk now.
- Measure urine osmolality hourly for the next 4h.

### Table 5.5 Interpreting the water deprivation test

| Diagnosis | Urine osmolality |
|-----------|------------------|
| Normal | Urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 U:P ratio >2 (normal concentrating ability) |
| Primary polydipsia | Urine concentrates, but less than normal, eg >400-600mOsmol/kg |
| Cranial DI | Urine osmolality increases to >600mOsmol/kg after desmopressin (if equivocal an extended water deprivation test may be tried (no drinking from 18:00 the night before)) |
| Nephrogenic DI | No increase in urine osmolality after desmopressin |

## Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)

In SIADH, ADH continues to be secreted in spite of low plasma osmolality or large plasma volume. Diagnosis requires concentrated urine (Na+ >20mmol/L and osmolality >100mOsmol/kg) in the presence of hyponatraemia and low plasma osmolality. Causes are numerous. See p673.
