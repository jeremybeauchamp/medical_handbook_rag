# Transient ischaemic attack (TIA)

This is an ischaemic (usually embolic) neurological event with symptoms lasting <24h (often much shorter). Without intervention, more than 1 in 12 patients will go on to have a stroke within a week, so prompt management is imperative.

## Signs
Specific to the arterial territory involved (p450). Amaurosis fugax occurs when the retinal artery is occluded, causing unilateral progressive vision loss 'like a curtain descending'. Global events (eg syncope, dizziness) are not typical of TIAs. Attacks may be single or many; multiple highly stereotyped attacks ('crescendo' TIAs) suggest a critical intracranial stenosis (commonly the superior division of the MCA).

## Causes
(See p470.)
- Atherothromboembolism from the carotid is the chief cause: listen for bruits (though not a sensitive test).
- Cardioembolism: mural thrombus post-MI or in AF, valve disease, prosthetic valve (p473).
- Hyperviscosity: eg polycythaemia, sickle-cell anaemia, myeloma.
- Vasculitis is a rare, non-embolic cause of TIA symptoms (eg cranial arteritis, PAN, SLE, syphilis, etc.).

## Differentials
Hypoglycaemia, migraine aura (p458), focal epilepsy (symptoms spread over seconds and often include twitching and jerking), hyperventilation, retinal bleeds. Rare mimics of TIA: Malignant hypertension, MS (paroxysmal dysarthria), intracranial tumours, peripheral neuropathy, phaeochromocytoma, somatization.

## Tests
FBC, ESR, U&Es, glucose, lipids, CXR, ECG, carotid Doppler ± angiography, CT or diffusion-weighted MRI, echocardiogram.

## Treatment
- Control cardiovascular risk factors: Optimize: BP (cautiously lower; aim for <140/85mmHg, p140); hyperlipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); help to stop smoking (p93).
- Antiplatelet drugs: As with stroke, give aspirin 300mg OD for 2wks, then switch to clopidogrel 75mg OD. If this is contraindicated or not tolerated, give aspirin 75mg OD combined with slow-release dipyridamole.
- Anticoagulation indications: Cardiac source of emboli (see p473).
- Carotid endarterectomy: Perform within 2wks of first presentation if 70-99% stenosis⁸ and operative risk is acceptable (higher risk in: ♀, >75y, ↑systolic BP, contralateral artery occluded; ipsilateral carotid syphon/external carotid stenosed). Do not stop aspirin preoperatively. Surgery is preferred to endovascular carotid artery angioplasty with stenting in those fit enough to tolerate due to higher peri-procedure stroke and mortality rates with stenting.

## Driving
Prohibited for at least 1 month, see p158.

## Prognosis
Long-term risks of stroke or cardiovascular events following TIAs are dependent on underlying vascular risk factors: calculate using the ABCD² score (see BOX and table 10.6).

⁸ Interventions for 50-69% stenoses can be justifiable; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50-69% range as compared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group) criteria.
