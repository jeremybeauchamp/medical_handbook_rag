# Asking questions

## Open questions
'How are you?', 'How does it feel?' The direction a patient chooses offers valuable information. 'Tell me about the vomit.' 'It was dark.' 'How dark?' 'Dark bits in it.' 'Like...?' 'Like bits of soil in it.' This information is gold, although it is not cast in the form of coffee grounds.

## Patient-centred questions
Patients may have their own ideas about what is causing their symptoms, how they impact, and what should be done. This is ever truer as patients frequently consult Dr Google before their GP. Unless their ideas, concerns, and expectations are elucidated, your patient may never be fully satisfied with you, or able to be fully involved in their own care.

## Considering the whole
Humans are not self-sufficient units; we are complex relational beings, constantly reacting to events, environments, and each other. To understand your patient's concerns you must understand their context: home-life, work, dreams, fears. Information from family and friends can be very helpful for identifying triggering and exacerbating factors, and elucidating the true underlying cause. A headache caused by anxiety is best treated not with analgesics, but by helping the patient access support.

## Silence and echoes
Often the most valuable details are the most difficult to verbalize. Help your patients express such thoughts by giving them time: if you interrogate a robin, he will fly away; treelike silence may bring him to your hand.

Whilst powerful, silence should not be oppressive—try echoing the last words said to encourage your patient to continue vocalizing a particular thought.

## Try to avoid

### Closed questions:
These permit no opportunity to deny assumptions. 'Have you had hip pain since your fall?' 'Yes, doctor.' Investigations are requested even though the same hip pain was also present for many years before the fall!

### Questions suggesting the answer:
'Was the vomit black—like coffee grounds?' 'Yes, like coffee grounds, doctor.' The doctor's expectations and hurry to get the evidence into a pre-decided format have so tarnished the story as to make it useless.

# Shared decision-making: no decision about me, without me

Shared decision-making aims to place patients' needs, wishes, and preferences at the centre of clinical decision-making.

- Support patients to articulate their understanding of their condition.
- Inform patients about their condition, treatment options, benefits, and risk.
- Make decisions based on mutual understanding.

Consider asking not, 'What is the matter?' but, 'What matters to you?'.

Consider also your tendency towards libertarian paternalism or 'nudge'. This is when information is given in such a way as to encourage individuals to make a particular choice that is felt to be in their best interests, and to correct apparent 'reasoning failure' in the patient. This is done by framing the information in either a positive or negative light depending on your view and how you might wish to sway your audience. Consider the following statements made about a new drug which offers 96% survival compared to 94% with an older drug:

- More people survive if they take this drug.
- This new drug reduces mortality by a third.
- This new drug benefits only 2% of patients.
- There may be unknown side-effects to the new drug.
