# The patient with CKD: a clinical approach

## History

- Does the patient really have CKD? Does the eGFR reflect the true GFR (p669)? Is the eGFR corrected for ethnicity/drugs (eg trimethoprim alters creatinine concentration but not GFR)? Evidence of chronicity, ie >3 months—is there a previous creatinine on record?
- Possible cause: Ask about previous UTI, lower urinary tract symptoms, PMH of BP, DM, IHD, systemic disorder, renal colic. Check drug history including when medications started. Family history including renal disease and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Systems review: look out for more than is immediately obvious, consider rare causes, ask about eyes, skin, joints, ask about symptoms suggestive of systemic disorder ('When did you last feel well?') and malignancy.
- Current state: Patients may have symptomatic CKD if GFR <30. Includes symptoms of fluid overload (SOB, peripheral oedema), anorexia, nausea, vomiting, restless legs, fatigue, weakness, pruritus, bone pain, amenorrhoea, impotence.

## Examination

- Periphery: Peripheral oedema. Signs of peripheral vascular disease or neuropathy. A vasculitic rash. Gouty tophi. Joint disease. Arteriovenous fistula (thrill, bruit, recently needling?). Signs of immunosuppression: bruising from steroids, skin malignancy. Uraemic flap/encephalopathy if GFR <15.
- Face: Anaemia, xanthelasma, yellow tinge (uraemia), jaundice (hepatorenal), gum hypertrophy (ciclosporin), Cushingoid (steroids), periorbital oedema (nephrotic syndrome), taut skin/telangiectasia (scleroderma), facial lipodystrophy (glomerulonephritis).
- Neck: JVP for fluid state, tunnelled line (if removed, look for small scar over internal jugular, and a larger scar in 'breast pocket' area), scar from parathyroidectomy, lymphadenopathy.
- Cardiovascular: BP, sternotomy, cardiomegaly, stigmata of endocarditis. If right-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not reflect fluid state.
- Respiratory: Pulmonary oedema or effusion.
- Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below umbilicus and to side of midline), signs of previous transplant (scar, palpable graft), ballotable polycystic kidneys ± palpable liver.

## Investigation

- Blood: U&E (compare with previous), Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia), glucose (DM), ↓Ca²⁺, ↑PO₄³⁻, ↑PTH (renal osteodystrophy). Directed investigation of intrinsic renal disease: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, paraprotein, complement, cryoglobulin, anti-GBM, hepatitis serology, anti-PLA2R (membranous nephropathy). Note: ESR is not helpful as ↑ in CKD and proteinuric states.
- Urine: Dipstick, MC&S, ACR or PCR (p294), Bence Jones.
- Imaging: USS for size, symmetry, anatomy, corticomedullary differentiation, and to exclude obstruction. In CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in infiltrative disorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM. If asymmetrical consider renovascular disease. Scarring may be seen on USS but isotope scans are more sensitive.
- Histology: Consider renal biopsy (p310) in progressive disease, nephrotic syndrome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treatment if GFR stable and PCR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need biopsy unless atypical, ie nephrotic, haematuria, other systemic symptoms.

## Monitoring renal function in CKD

GFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk. If high risk, monitor every 6 months (fig 7.5, orange), if very high risk, monitor at least every 3-4 months (fig 7.5, red). Small fluctuations are common but a drop in eGFR stage with ↓eGFR ≥25% is significant. Rapid progression is ↓eGFR >5/yr.

Risk factors for decline: BP, DM, metabolic disturbance, volume depletion, infection, NSAIDs, smoking. All CKD has risk of superimposed AKI and needs monitoring and prompt treatment during intercurrent illness.
