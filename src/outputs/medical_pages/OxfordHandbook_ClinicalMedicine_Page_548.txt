## Palliative care: other symptoms

Non-pain symptoms include:

### Nausea and vomiting
**Causes:** Chemotherapy, constipation, hypercalcaemia, oral candidiasis, GI obstruction, drugs, severe pain, infection, renal failure.

**Management:** Treat reversible causes, eg laxatives for constipation, analgesia for pain, hypercalcaemia (see p528), fluconazole for oral candidiasis. Anti-emetic choice should be based on the likely mechanism of nausea. Consider the site of anti-emetic action, especially when using a combination of drugs. Oral absorption may be poor so consider alternative routes (SC/IV/PR). Options include the following:

- Cyclizine 50mg/8h: antihistamine, anticholinergic, central action so good for intracranial disorders.
- Metoclopramide 10-20mg/8h: blocks central chemoreceptor trigger zone, peripheral prokinetic effects so good in gastroparesis, monitor for extra-pyramidal side-effects.
- Domperidone 10-20mg/8h PO: peripheral antidopaminergic so no dystonic effects.
- Haloperidol 1.5mg PO initially 1-2 times daily: dopamine antagonist, effective in drug- or metabolically induced nausea, use lower doses IV/SC as twice as potent.
- Ondansetron 4-8mg/8h: serotonin antagonist, good for chemo/radiotherapy-related nausea, may cause constipation.
- Levomepromazine 6.25mg, initially 1-2 times daily: broad spectrum, but can sedate, may be very effective if fear/anxiety are contributing to symptoms.

Antisecretory drugs, such as hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide may be required for patients with vomiting and bowel obstruction: seek expert advice.

### Constipation
**Causes:** Very common side-effect of opioids. Better to prevent than treat so prescribe laxatives for all patients starting opioids. Also hypercalcaemia (see p528), dehydration, drugs, or intra-abdominal disease.

**Treatment:** Treat reversible causes. Good fluid intake. Ensure privacy and access to toilet. Medication options include the following:
- Stimulant (eg senna 2-4 tablets or bisacodyl 5-10mg) at night ± a softener (eg sodium docusate 100mg BD).
- Osmotic laxative (eg macrogol).
- Rectal treatments: bisacodyl/glycerol suppositories, phosphate enema.

### Breathlessness
**Causes:** Look for reversible causes including infection, effusion, anaemia, arrhythmia, thromboembolism. If stridor or signs of superior vena cava syndrome, treat urgently (see p528).

**Treatment:** Treat reversible causes as appropriate. Consider thoracocentesis ± pleurodesis for a pleural effusion. Recurrent pleural effusions may warrant a radiologically placed permanent drain (see p527). If the patient remains distressed, consider a trial of low-dose opioids. These reduce respiratory drive and the sensation of breathlessness. If opioid-naive, start with 2.5mg of an immediate-release morphine every 4h. If already taking an opioid, use the appropriate breakthrough dose (see p533). Benzodiazepines may help if associated anxiety, eg lorazepam 500mcg SL every 4-6h.

### Oral problems
**Causes:** Poor oral hygiene, radiation, drugs (anticholinergics, chemotherapy, diuretics), infection (candidiasis, herpes simplex).

**Treatment:** Oral candidiasis: topical miconazole, oral fluconazole 50mg OD but check for interactions (eg warfarin). Nystatin is often ineffective and may exacerbate nausea. Herpes simplex: oral gan/aciclovir. Good mouth care maintains comfort and the ability to communicate. Maintain fluid intake with frequent, small drinks. Simple measures are often effective: sugar-free chewing gum, normal saline mouthwashes, soft toothbrush. Products containing alcohol may sting. Salivary stimulants (rather than substitutes) can be helpful for dry mouth, eg pilocarpine eye drops 4%, 3 drops in the floor of mouth QDS. Severe mucositis may need admission and systemic opioids.
