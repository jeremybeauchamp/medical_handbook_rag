## Zika virus

Arbovirus (Flavivirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquito. First identified in Zika forest, Uganda, 1947. Human cases rare until outbreak in Pacific Islands (2007-2013), and Brazil (2015). Estimated 1.5 million cases in Brazil by 2016. Zika detected in sperm and blood products so transmission not limited to vector. Up-to-date geographic and clinical data available at: www.ecdc.europa.eu Presentation: Subclinical in ~80%. Mild illness in ~20%: fever, conjunctivitis, myalgia, rash. Severe acute illness and Guillian-Barré are rare. Zika and birth defects: Geographical and temporal relationship between infection and microcephaly. Zika detected in amniotic fluid is evidence of placental transfer. Specific fetal syndrome: microcephaly, intracranial calcification, eye pathology, redundant scalp skin. Small, uncontrolled studies show fetal abnormalities in up to 30% of pregnant women infected with Zika.¹³ Absolute and relative risks unknown (2016). Diagnosis: PCR of viral DNA in blood/body fluid. Treatment: Vector control, avoid non-essential travel in pregnancy, condoms to prevent sexual transmission. Vaccine trials ongoing (2016).

## Lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis)

>40 million affected and disfigured. >1 billion at risk (80% in sub-Saharan Africa). Filarial parasites (nematodes) transmitted via mosquitoes which bite infected hosts and ingest microfilaria. These mature in the mosquito with infective larvae transferring to new hosts during feeding. Adult worms form nests in lymphatic vessels causing damage and lymphoedema. Transmission prevented by an annual dose of two drugs—5.63 billion treatments delivered by WHO since 2000.¹² Types of filarial worm:

- Wuchereria bancrofti (fig 9.29) ~90% of disease.
- Brugia malaya ~10%.
- Brugia timori possible cause of disease.

Presentation: Asymptomatic infection ± subclinical lymphatic damage. Acute episodes of local inflammation: pain, fever. Chronic damage: lymphoedema (fig 9.30), hydrocele, chylocele, scrotal/penile swelling. CKD: proteinuria, haematuria. Immune hyperreactivity → tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (cough, wheeze, fibrosis, ↑eosinophil counts, ↑IgE).

Diagnosis: Microfilariae in blood smear (fig 9.29), antifilarial IgG, visualization of worms on USS/tissue sample. Treatment: Lymphoedema care. Prevention in high-risk populations: albendazole plus either diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermectin. DEC is contraindicated in onchocerciasis (p439), care with circulating Loa Loa (p439) due to risk of encephalopathy and renal failure. Household salt can be fortified with DEC.

## The global advance of vector-borne disease?

Since 1990, five species of Aedes mosquito have become established in Europe. The adaptation of mosquitoes to a temperate environment, combined with future climate forecasts has led to models¹⁴ that predict the UK will be suitable for:

- Plasmodium falciparum transmission by 2030-2080
- Plasmodium vivax transmission by 2030
- Chikungunya transmission in London by 2041
- Dengue transmission after 2100.

Of course, modelling is not simple. Socioeconomic development, urbanization, land-use change, migration, and globalization all come into play. Surveillance of mosquitoes at sea-ports, airports, and used-tyre companies remains uninteresting to date. But consider a time when a visit to South-East England offers an opportunity to explore the historical gems of our wonderful capital, and simultaneously becomes a pertinent question in your diagnostic sieve....
