# Lymphadenopathy

Causes of lymphadenopathy are either reactive or infiltrative:

## Reactive:

### Infective:
- Bacterial: eg pyogenic, TB, brucella, syphilis.
- Viral: EBV, HIV, CMV, infectious hepatitis.
- Others: toxoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis.

### Non-infective: 
sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, berylliosis, connective tissue disease (eg rheumatoid, SLE), dermatological (eczema, psoriasis), drugs (eg phenytoin).

## Infiltrative:

### Benign histiocytosis—OHCS p644, lipoidoses.

### Malignant:
- Haematological: lymphoma or leukaemia: ALL, CLL, AML (p356).
- Metastatic carcinoma: from breast, lung, bowel, prostate, kidney, or head and neck cancers.

# Oedema
(See p579.)

## Pitting oedema: 
Fluid can either be squeezed out of the veins (increased hydrostatic pressure, eg DVT, right heart failure) or diffuse out because of reduced oncotic pressure (low plasma proteins, eg cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) leading to an osmotic gradient with the tissues (fig 2.9, p39, p579). The cause of oedema is still not completely understood.

## Periorbital oedema: 
Oedema around the face has a very different differential; the eyelid skin is very thin so periorbital oedema is usually the first sign—think of allergies (contact dermatitis, eg from eye make-up, stings), angioedema (can be hereditary), infection (orbital cellulitis can be life-threatening, refer to hospital immediately if concerned, other infections include EBV and sinusitis); if there is proptosis (p219) think Graves' disease, connective tissue diseases (eg dermatomyositis, SLE, sarcoid, amyloid); and many others. Assess for systemic disease before putting it down to allergies.

## Non-pitting oedema: 
Ie non-indentable, is lymphoedema due to poor lymphatic drainage. Can be due to radiotherapy, malignant infiltration, infection, filariasis, or rarely primary lymphoedema (Milroy's syndrome p706).

# Weight loss

Weight loss can be both a symptom (ie reported by the patient) and a sign (identified by physician). A feature of chronic disease, depression, malnutrition, malignancy, chronic infections (eg TB, HIV/enteropathic AIDS), diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism (typically in the presence of increased appetite). Severe generalized muscle wasting is also seen as part of a number of degenerative neurological diseases and in cardiac failure (cardiac cachexia), although in the latter, right heart failure may not make weight loss a major complaint. Do not forget anorexia nervosa (OHCS p382) as an underlying cause of weight loss.

Rule out treatable causes, eg diabetes is easy to diagnose—TB can be very hard. For example, the CXR may look like cancer so don't forget to send bronchoscopy samples for ZN stain and TB culture. Unintentional weight loss should always ring alarm bells, so assess patients carefully.

# Cachexia

General muscle wasting from famine, or eating (dementia; stroke; MND, p506; anorexia nervosa), malabsorption (enteropathic AIDS/slim disease/Cryptosporidium; Whipple's) or catabolism (neoplasia; CCF; TB; chronic kidney disease; leptin).
