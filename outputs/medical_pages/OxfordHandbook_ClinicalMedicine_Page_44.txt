## Systemic enquiry

Just as skilled acrobats are happy to work without safety nets, so experienced clinicians may operate without the functional enquiry. But to do this you must be experienced enough to understand all the nuances of the presenting complaint.

### General questions
May be the most significant, eg in TB, endocrine problems, or cancer:
- Weight loss.
- Night sweats.
- Any lumps.
- Fatigue/malaise/lethargy.
- Sleeping pattern.¹
- Appetite.
- Fevers.
- Itch or rash.
- Recent trauma.

### Cardiorespiratory symptoms
- Chest pain (p94).
- Exertional dyspnoea (=breathlessness): quantify exercise tolerance and how it has changed, eg stairs climbed, or distance walked, before onset of breathlessness.
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND). Orthopnoea, ie breathlessness on lying flat (a symptom of left ventricular failure): quantify in terms of number of pillows the patient must sleep on to prevent dyspnoea.
- Oedema: ankles, legs, lower back (dependent areas).
- Palpitations (awareness of heartbeats): can they tap out the rhythm?
- Cough: sputum, haemoptysis (coughing up blood).
- Wheeze.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms
- Abdominal pain (constant or colicky, sharp or dull; site; radiation; duration; onset; severity; relationship to eating and bowel action; alleviating or exacerbating, or associated features).
- Other questions—think of symptoms throughout the GI tract, from mouth to anus:
  - Swallowing (p250).
  - Indigestion (p252).
  - Nausea/vomiting; blood? (p250).
  - Bowel habit (p258 & p260).
  - Stool: colour, consistency, blood, mucus; difficulty flushing away (p266); tenesmus or urgency.

Tenesmus is the feeling of incomplete evacuation of the bowels (eg due to a tumour or irritable bowel syndrome). Haematemesis is vomiting blood. Melaena is altered (black) blood passed PR (p256), with a characteristic offensive smell and tar like appearance.

### Genitourinary symptoms
- Incontinence (stress or urge, p648).
- Dysuria (painful micturition).
- Urinary abnormalities: colour? Haematuria (streaks or pink urine?) Frothy?
- Nocturia (needing to micturate at night).
- Frequency (frequent micturition) or polyuria (the frequent passing of large volumes of urine).
- Hesitancy (difficulty starting micturition).
- Terminal dribbling.
- Vaginal discharge (colour, odour); pain on intercourse (dyspareunia) (p412).
- Menses: frequency, regularity, heavy or light, duration, painful? First day of last menstrual period (LMP). Number of pregnancies and births. Menarche. Menopause. Any chance of pregnancy now?

¹ Too sleepy? Think of myxoedema or narcolepsy. Early waking? Think of depression. Being woken by pain is always a serious sign. For the significance of the other questions listed here, see Chapter 3.
