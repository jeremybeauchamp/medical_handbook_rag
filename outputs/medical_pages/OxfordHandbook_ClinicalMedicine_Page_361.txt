Special tests may be available (factor assays: consult a haematologist).

## Towards a better assay for clotting function

Bleeding time, a barbaric and unreliable test (the clue is in the name), is no longer used. Amongst the range of techniques to replicate the clotting process in vitro is thromboelastography (TEG). TEG permits rapid and more precise assays of clotting function under massive transfusion situations (eg major surgery, especially trauma). In particular, advances in this field have been driven by recent military usage.

## Is this pre-op patient at risk of excessive bleeding?

Take a bleeding history! The more structured this is the better. Enquire about factors which may indicate increased bleeding risk, such as:
• past history of excessive, prolonged, or unexplained bleeding
• comorbidities such as lupus or liver disease
• on agents known to affect haemostasis.

In such cases, or if bleeding would be disastrous, further tests may be indicated after discussion with a haematologist.
