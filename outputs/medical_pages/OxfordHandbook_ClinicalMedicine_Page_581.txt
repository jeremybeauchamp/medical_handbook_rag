# Pre-operative history, examination, and tests

It is the anaesthetist's responsibility to assess suitability for anaesthesia. The ward doctor assists with a good history and examination, should anticipate necessary tests, and can also reassure and inform the patient. The surgical team should consent the patient.

The World Health Organization 'Surgical Safety Checklist' should be completed for every patient undergoing a surgical procedure, ensuring pre-operative preparation, intra-operative monitoring, and post-operative review.

## History
Assess past history of: MI¹, diabetes, asthma, hypertension, rheumatic fever, epilepsy, jaundice. Existing illnesses, drugs, and allergies? Be alert to chronic lung disease, BP, arrhythmias, and murmurs. Assess any specific risks, eg is the patient pregnant? Is the neck/jaw immobile and teeth stable (intubation risk)? Has there been previous anaesthesia? Were there any complications (eg nausea, DVT)?

## Examination
Assess cardiorespiratory system, exercise tolerance. Is the neck unstable (eg arthritis complicating intubation)? Is DVT/PE prophylaxis needed (p578)? For 'unilateral' surgery, mark the correct arm/leg/kidney (surgeon).

## Tests
Be guided by the history and examination and local/NICE protocols.

- U&E, FBC, and finger-prick blood glucose in most patients. If Hb <100g/L tell anaesthetist. Investigate/treat as appropriate. U&E are particularly important if the patient is starved, diabetic, on diuretics, a burns patient, has hepatic or renal disease, has an ileus, or is parenterally fed.

- Crossmatch: Blood type is identified and units are allocated to the patient. Group and save (G&S): Blood type is identified and held, pending crossmatch (if required). Contact your lab to discuss requirements—this decreases wastage and allows increased efficiency of blood stocks.

- Specific blood tests: LFT in jaundice, malignancy, or alcohol abuse. Amylase in acute abdominal pain. Blood glucose if diabetic (p588). Drug levels as appropriate (eg digoxin, lithium). Clotting studies in liver or renal disease, DIC (p352), massive blood loss, or if on valproate, warfarin, or heparin. HIV, HBsAg in high-risk patients, after counselling. Sickle test in those from Africa, West Indies, or Mediterranean—and if origins are in malarial areas (including most of India). Thyroid function tests in those with thyroid disease.

- CXR if known cardiorespiratory disease, pathology, or symptoms or >65yrs old. Remember to check the film prior to surgery.

- ECG if >55yrs old or poor exercise tolerance, or history of myocardial ischaemia, hypertension, rheumatic fever, or other heart disease.

- Echocardiogram may be performed if there is a suspicion of poor LV function.

- Pulmonary function tests in known pulmonary disease/obesity.

- Lateral cervical spine X-ray (flexion and extension views) if history of rheumatoid arthritis/ankylosing spondylitis/Down's syndrome, to warn of difficult intubations.

- MRSA screen: Screen and decolonize nasal carriers according to local policy (eg nasal mupirocin ointment). Colonization is not a contraindication to surgery. Place patients last on the list to minimize transmission to others and cover with appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis, eg vancomycin or teicoplanin. Consider and document major blood-borne virus risk (HIV/HBV/HCV) according to local policies.

## American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Class I | Normally healthy patient. |
| Class II | Mild systemic disease. |
| Class III | Severe systemic disease that limits activity but is not incapacitating. |
| Class IV | Incapacitating systemic disease which poses a constant threat to life. |
| Class V | Moribund: not expected to survive 24h even with operation. |

You will see a space for an ASA number on most anaesthetic charts. It is a health index at the time of surgery. The suffix E is used in emergencies, eg ASA 2E.

¹ If within the last 6 months, the perioperative risk of re-infarction (up to 40%) makes most elective surgery too risky. ECHO, and stress testing (+ exercise ECG or MUGA scan, p741) should be done.
