# Metabolic bone diseases: osteoporosis

Osteoporosis implies reduced bone mass. It may be 1° (age-related) or 2° to another condition or drugs. If trabecular bone is affected, crush fractures of vertebrae are common (hence the 'littleness' of little old ladies and their dowager's hump); if cortical bone is affected, long bone fractures are more likely, eg femoral neck: the big cause of death and orthopaedic expense (80% hip fractures in the UK occur in women >50yrs).

**Prevalence** (In those >50yrs): ♂ 6%, ♀ 18%. Women lose trabeculae with age, but in men, although there is reduced bone formation, numbers of trabeculae are stable and their lifetime risk of fracture is less.

**Risk factors** Age-independent risk factors for 1° osteoporosis: parental history, alcohol >4 units daily, rheumatoid arthritis, BMI <19, prolonged immobility, and untreated menopause. See BOX 'Osteoporosis risk factors' for other risk factors, including for 2° osteoporosis.

**Investigations** X-ray (low sensitivity/specificity, often with hindsight after a fracture). Bone densitometry (DEXA—see BOX 'DEXA bone densitometry'; table 14.5). Bloods: Ca²⁺, PO₄³⁻, and ALP normal. Consider specific investigations for 2° causes if suggestive history. Biopsy is unreliable and unnecessary with non-invasive techniques available.

**Management** Loss of bone mineral density may not be entirely irreversible. Age, number of risk factors, and bone mineral density (DEXA scan; see BOX 'DEXA bone densitometry') guide the pharmacological approach (eg FRAX, which is a WHO risk assessment tool for estimating 10-yr risk of osteoporotic fracture in untreated patients; see www.shef.ac.uk/frax),¹³,¹⁴ although DEXA is not necessary if age >75yrs. Lifestyle measures should apply to all (including those at risk but not yet osteoporotic).

*Lifestyle measures:*
- Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption.
- Weight-bearing exercise may increase bone mineral density.¹⁵
- Balance exercises such as tai chi reduce risk of falls.
- Calcium and vitamin D-rich diet (use supplements if diet is insufficient—see 'Pharmacological measures' later in this topic).
- Home-based fall-prevention programme, with visual assessment and a home visit.
  NB: hip-protectors are unreliable for preventing fractures.¹⁶

*Pharmacological measures:*
- **Bisphosphonates**: alendronic acid is 1st line (10mg/d or 70mg/wk; not if eGFR <35). Use also for prevention in long-term steroid use. If intolerant, try etidronate or risedronate. Tell patient to swallow pills with plenty of water while remaining upright for >30min and wait 30min before eating or other drugs. (SE: photosensitivity; GI upset; oesophageal ulcers—stop if dysphagia or abdo pain; rarely, jaw osteonecrosis).
- **Calcium and vitamin D**: rarely used alone for prophylaxis, as questionable efficacy and some evidence of a small ↑CV risk. Offer if evidence of deficiency, eg calcium 1g/d + vit D 800U/d. Target serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level ≥75nmol/L.
- **Strontium ranelate**: due to an increased risk of cardiac problems it should only be used in those with severe intolerance of other agents and without cardiovascular disease.
- **Hormone replacement therapy** (HRT) can prevent (not treat) osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Relative risk of breast cancer is 1.4 if used >10yrs; ↑CV risk.
- **Raloxifene** is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts similarly to HRT, but with ↓ breast cancer risk.
- **Teriparatide** (recombinant PTH) is useful in those who suffer further fractures despite treatment with other agents. There is a potential ↑ risk of renal malignancy.
- **Calcitonin** may reduce pain after a vertebral fracture.
- **Testosterone** may help in hypogonadal men by promoting trabecular connectivity.
- **Denosumab**, a monoclonal Ab to RANK ligand, given SC twice yearly ↓ reabsorption.
