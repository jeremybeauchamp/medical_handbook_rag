Fig 4.15 Supine chest radiograph showing air-space shadowing in a perihilar distribution spreading into the peripheries. This appearance can also be seen with infection and cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, but clues from the history, the heart size, and lack of pleural effusions can suggest ARDS over the latter. Remember though that this is a supine projection—the patient is lying flat with the X-ray beam AP—causing the cardiac shadow to be artificially enlarged and pleural effusions to level out on the posterior chest wall so they will not obscure the costophrenic angles unless very large.
