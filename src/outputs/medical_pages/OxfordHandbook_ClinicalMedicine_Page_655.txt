# Obstructive uropathy

In chronic urinary retention, an episode of acute retention may go unnoticed for days and, because of their background symptoms, may only present when overflow incontinence becomes a nuisance—pain is not necessarily a feature.

After diagnosing acute on chronic retention and placing a catheter, the bladder residual can be as much as 1.5L of urine. Don't be surprised to be called by the biochemistry lab to be told that the serum creatinine is 1000μmol/L! The good news is that renal function usually returns to baseline after a few days (there may be mild background impairment).

Ask for an urgent renal US (fig 13.49) and consider the following in the acute plan to ensure a safe course:

• **Hyperkalaemia** See p301.
• **Metabolic acidosis** On ABG there is likely to be a respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis. Concerns should prompt discussion with a renal specialist (a good idea anyway), in case haemodialysis is required (p306).
• **Post-obstructive diuresis** In the acute phase after relief of the obstruction, the kidneys produce a lot of urine—as much as a litre in the first hour. It is vital to provide resuscitation fluids and then match input with output. Fluid depletion rather than overload is the danger here.
• **Sodium- and bicarbonate-losing nephropathy** As the kidney undergoes diuresis, Na+ and bicarbonate are lost in the urine in large quantities. Replace 'in for out' (as mentioned above) with isotonic 1.26% sodium bicarbonate solution—this should be available from ITU. Some advocate using 0.9% saline, though the chloride load may exacerbate acidosis. Withhold any nephrotoxic drugs.
• **Infection** Treat infection, bearing in mind that the WCC and CRP may be part of the stress response. Send a sample of urine for MC&S.
