## Contraindications and cautions to PD5 inhibitors

### Contraindications
- Concurrent use of nitrates.
- BP high or systolic <90mmHg/arrhythmia.
- Degenerative retinal disorders, eg retinitis pigmentosa.
- Unstable angina/stroke <6 months ago.
- Myocardial infarction <90 days ago.

### Cautions
- Angina (especially if during intercourse).
- Bleeding; peptic ulcer (sildenafil).
- Marked hepatic or renal impairment.
- Peyronie's disease or cavernosal fibrosis.
- Risk of priapism (sickle-cell anaemia, myeloma, leukaemia).
- Concurrent complex antihypertensive regimens.
- Dyspnoea on minimal effort (sexual activity may be unsupportable).

Use in coronary artery disease has been a question, but is probably OK.

### Interactions
Nitrates (contraindication); cytochrome p450 (CYP3A) inducers: macrolides, protease inhibitors, theophyllines, azole antifungals, rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, grapefruit juice (↑bioavailability). Caution if α-blocker use; avoid vardenafil with type 1A (eg quinidine; procainamide) and type 3 anti-arrhythmics (sotalol; amiodarone)—as well as nitrates as above-mentioned.

## Male hypogonadism

Hypogonadism is failure of testes to produce testosterone, sperm, or both. Features: small testes, ↓libido, erectile dysfunction, loss of pubic hair, ↓muscle bulk, ↑fat, gynaecomastia, osteoporosis, ↓mood. If prepubertal: ↓virilization; incomplete puberty; eunuchoid body; reduced secondary sex characteristics. Causes include:

### Primary hypogonadism 
Is due to testicular failure, eg from 
- local trauma, torsion, chemotherapy/irradiation 
- post-orchitis, eg mumps, HIV, brucellosis, leprosy
- renal failure, liver cirrhosis, or alcohol excess (toxic to Leydig cells) 
- chromosomal abnormalities, eg Klinefelter's syndrome (47XXY)—delayed sexual development, small testes, and gynaecomastia. Anorchia is rare.

### Secondary hypogonadism 
↓Gonadotropins (LH & FSH), eg from 
- hypopituitarism
- prolactinoma 
- Kallman's syndrome—isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency, often with anosmia and colour blindness 
- systemic illness (eg COPD; HIV; DM) 
- Laurence–Moon–Biedl and Prader–Willi syndromes (OHCS p648 & p652) 
- Age.

℞: (p232) If total testosterone ≤8nmol/L, on 2 mornings (or <15 if ↑LH too) and ↓muscle bulk, testosterone may help, eg 1% dermal gel (Testogel®). Heart, bladder, and sexual function may perk up in age-related hypogonadism. Beware medicalizing ageing!
