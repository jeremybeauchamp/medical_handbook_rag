| Expiratory flow curve starting with PEF, then FEF50, FEF25 | Expiratory flow curve with reduced peak and flattened shape | Expiratory flow curve with flattened top |
| Inspiratory flow curve with PIF and FIF50 | Inspiratory flow curve similar to normal | Inspiratory flow curve with reduced peak |
| X-axis: 75%, 50%, 25% | X-axis: 75%, 50%, 25% | X-axis: 75%, 50%, 25% Volume |

PEF=peak expiratory flow; FEF50=forced expiratory flow at 50% TLC;
FEF25=forced expiratory flow at 25% TLC; PIF=peak inspiratory flow;
FIF50=forced inspiratory flow at 50% TLC.
