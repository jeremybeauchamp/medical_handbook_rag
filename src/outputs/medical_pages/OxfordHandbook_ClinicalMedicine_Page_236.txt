# Parathyroid hormone and hyperparathyroidism

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is normally secreted in response to low ionized Ca²⁺ levels, by four parathyroid glands situated posterior to the thyroid (p601). The glands are controlled by -ve feedback via Ca²⁺ levels. PTH acts by: 
- ↑osteoclast activity releasing Ca²⁺ and PO₄³⁻ from bones 
- ↑Ca²⁺ and ↓PO₄³⁻ reabsorption in the kidney 
- ↑active 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D₃ production is ↑. 
Overall effect is ↑Ca²⁺ and ↓PO₄³⁻.

## Primary hyperparathyroidism 
**Causes:** ~80% solitary adenoma, ~20% hyperplasia of all glands, <0.5% parathyroid cancer. 
**Presentation:** Often 'asymptomatic' (→not in retrospect!), with ↑Ca²⁺ on routine tests. Signs relate to: 
1. ↑Ca²⁺ (p676): weak, tired, depressed, thirsty, dehydrated-but-polyuric; also renal stones, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and ulcers (duodenal:gastric≈7:1). 
2. Bone resorption effects of PTH can cause pain, fractures, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. 
3. ↑BP: so check Ca²⁺ in everyone with hypertension. 
**Association:** MEN-1 (BOX 'Multiple endocrine neoplasia'). 
**Tests:** ↑Ca²⁺ & ↑PTH or inappropriately normal (other causes of this: thiazides, lithium, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, tertiary hyperparathyroidism). Also ↓PO₄³⁻ (unless in renal failure), ↑ALP from bone activity, 24h urinary ↑Ca²⁺. 
**Imaging:** osteitis fibrosa cystica (due to severe resorption; rare) may show up as subperiosteal erosions, cysts, or brown tumours of phalanges ± acro-osteolysis (fig 5.17) ± 'pepper-pot' skull. DEXA (p683; for osteoporosis, p682). 
**Rx:** If mild: advise ↑fluid intake to prevent stones; avoid thiazides + high Ca²⁺ & vit D intake; see 6-monthly. Excision of the adenoma or of all four hyperplastic glands prevents fractures and peptic ulcers. 
**Indications:** ↑high serum or urinary Ca²⁺, bone disease, osteoporosis, renal calculi, ↓renal function, age ≤50yrs. 
**Complications:** Hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve damage (∴ hoarse), symptomatic ↓Ca²⁺ (hungry bones syndrome; check Ca²⁺ daily for ≥14d post-op). Pre-op US and MIBI scan may localize an adenoma; intra-operative PTH sampling is used to confirm removal. 
**Recurrence:** ~8% over 10yrs. Cinacalcet (a 'calcimimetic') ↑sensitivity of parathyroid cells to Ca²⁺ (∴ ↓PTH secretion); monitor Ca²⁺ within 1 week of dose changes; SE: myalgia; ↓testosterone.

## Secondary hyperparathyroidism 
↓Ca²⁺, ↑PTH (appropriately). 
**Causes:** ↓vit D intake, chronic renal failure. 
**Rx:** Correct causes. Phosphate binders; vit D; cinacalcet if PTH ≥85pmol/L and parathyroidectomy tricky.

## Tertiary hyperparathyroidism 
↑Ca²⁺, ↑PTH (inappropriately). Occurs after prolonged secondary hyperparathyroidism, causing glands to act autonomously having undergone hyperplastic or adenomatous change. This causes ↑Ca²⁺ from ↑secretion of PTH unlimited by feedback control. Seen in chronic renal failure.

## Malignant hyperparathyroidism 
Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) is produced by some squamous cell lung cancers, breast and renal cell carcinomas. This mimics PTH resulting in ↑Ca²⁺ (PTH is ↓, as PTHrP is not detected in the assay).

# Hypoparathyroidism

## Primary hypoparathyroidism 
PTH secretion is ↓ due to gland failure. 
**Tests:** ↓Ca²⁺, ↑PO₄³⁻or →, →ALP. 
**Signs:** Those of hypocalcaemia, p678 ± autoimmune comorbidities (BOX 'Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes'). 
**Causes:** Autoimmune; congenital (Di George syn., OHCS p642). 
**Rx:** Ca²⁺ supplements + calcitriol (or synthetic PTH /12h SC: it prevents hypercalciuria).

## Secondary hypoparathyroidism 
Radiation, surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy), hypomagnesaemia (magnesium is required for PTH secretion).

## Pseudohypoparathyroidism 
Failure of target cell response to PTH. 
**Signs:** Short metacarpals (esp. 4th and 5th, fig 5.18), round face, short stature, calcified basal ganglia (fig 5.19), ↓IQ. 
**Tests:** ↓Ca²⁺, ↑PTH, → or ↑ALP. 
**Rx:** As for 1° hypoparathyroidism.

## Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism 
The morphological features of pseudohypoparathyroidism, but with normal biochemistry. The cause for both is genetic.
