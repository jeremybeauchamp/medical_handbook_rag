# Skin disease

Dermatoses occur in 8-23% of travellers and are the 3rd most common health problem in travellers after diarrhoea and fever. The differential of skin problems in travellers in outlined in fig 9.54.

| Infectious (more common) | Non-infectious (less common) |
| Cosmopolitan infection (~75%) | Tropical disease (~25%) | • Arthropod bite<br>• Allergic reaction<br>• Sunburn<br>• Injury<br>• Animal bite |
| • Scabies<br>• Bacterial infection<br>• Superficial fungal<br>• Swimmer's itch (p434)<br>• Herpes simplex<br>• Herpes zoster | • Cutaneous larva migrans<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(p433, fig 9.42)<br>• Cutaneous leishmaniasis<br>• Myiasis<br>• Tungiasis<br>• Rickettsial infection<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(p422)<br>• Dengue (p420)<br>• Filariasis (p421)<br>• Leprosy<br>• Yaws |

## Scabies

Caused by microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Found worldwide, ~300 million cases/yr. Female mites burrow into the epidermis and deposit eggs. Symptoms due to an allergic reaction to the parasite. Transmission via direct and prolonged skin-to-skin contact. Epidemics linked to poverty, overcrowding, and poor water supply. Presentation: Severe (nocturnal) pruritus, papular/scaly rash, burrows may be visible (fig 9.55). Itch can lead to secondary bacterial infection. Diagnosis: Clinical. Skin scraping for mite/eggs/faeces. Treatment: Topical permethrin 5% or malathion 0.5%. Ivermectin given for filariasis (p421) may effectively treat concurrent scabies.

## Cutaneous leishmaniasis

Most common form of leishmaniasis. Estimated 0.7-1.3 million new cases/yr: Americas, Mediterranean basin, north Africa, Middle East, central Asia. Presentation: Lesions develop at the bite site, beginning as an itchy papule; crusts fall off to leave a painless ulcer with a well-defined, raised border and a crusted base = 'Chiclero's ulcer' (fig 9.56). Diagnosis: Skin biopsy + PCR. Treatment: Most heal in ~2-15 months with scarring (disfiguring if extensive). 'New World' disease (South America) needs treating due to risk of mucocutaneous disease: pentavalent antimony, eg meglumine antimoniate, sodium stibogluconate. (See p423.)
