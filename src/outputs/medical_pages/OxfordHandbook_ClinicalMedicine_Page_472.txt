# Migraine

15% of us suffer from migraines, (♀:♂ ≈3:1); the economic costs extend to £billions/yr.

## Symptoms
Classically: 
- Visual or other aura (see below) lasting 15-30min followed within 1h by unilateral, throbbing headache. Or:
- Isolated aura with no headache;
- Episodic severe headaches without aura, often premenstrual, usually unilateral, with nausea, vomiting ± photophobia/phonophobia ('common migraine'). 

There may be allodynia—all stimuli produce pain: 'I can't brush my hair, wear earrings or glasses, or shave, it's so painful.' 

Prodrome: Precedes headache by hours/days: yawning, cravings, mood/sleep change. 

Aura: 
- Visual: chaotic distorting, 'melting' and jumbling of lines, dots, or zigzags, scotomata or hemianopia; 
- Somatosensory: paraesthesiae spreading from fingers to face; 
- Motor: dysarthria and ataxia (basilar migraine), ophthalmoplegia, or hemiparesis; 
- Speech: (8% of auras) dysphasia or paraphasia.

## Partial triggers 
Seen in 50%: CHOCOLATE or: chocolate, hangovers, orgasms, cheese/caffeine, oral contraceptives, lie-ins, alcohol, travel, or exercise.

## Associations 
Obesity, family history.

## Diagnosis 
Clinical, based on the history. Diagnostic criteria if no aura: ≥5 headaches lasting 4-72h + nausea/vomiting (or photo/phonophobia) + any 2 of: 
- Unilateral
- Pulsating 
- Impairs (or worsened by) routine activity.

## Differentials 
Cluster or tension headache, cervical spondylosis, ↑BP, intracranial pathology, sinusitis/otitis media, dental caries. TIAs may mimic migraine aura.

## Management 
- Avoid identified triggers and ensure analgesic rebound headache is not complicating matters (p456). 
- Prophylactic treatment: Can achieve ~50%↓ in attack frequency in most patients; consider after risks and benefits discussion.
  1st line: Propranolol 40-120mg/12h or topiramate 25-50mg/12h (teratogenic, can interfere with Pill efficacy). Amitriptyline 10-75mg nocte can be used, though this is off-licence. 
- Patients may be on previously-recommended prophylactic agents (eg valproate, pizotifen, pregabalin or ACE-i): if achieving good control then continue as required. 
- 12-weekly botulinum toxin type A injections are a last resort in chronic migraine. 
- Treatment during an attack: NICE recommends an oral triptan (or nasal in 12-17y) combined with either an NSAID or paracetamol. Monotherapy with any of the above (or aspirin 900mg) can also be considered. Anti-emetics may help even in the absence of nausea and vomiting. 
- Triptans are CI if IHD, coronary spasm, uncontrolled ↑BP, recent lithium, SSRIs, or ergot use. Rare SE: arrhythmias or angina ± MI, even if no pre-existing risk. 
- Non-pharmacological therapies: Warm or cold packs to the head, or rebreathing into paper bag (↑PCO2) may help abort attacks. Butterbur extracts or riboflavin supplementation may have a role. NICE recommend 10 sessions of acupuncture over 5-8 weeks if both topiramate and propranolol are unsuitable or ineffective. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation may help.

## Considerations in females 
Incidence of migraine (especially with aura) + ischaemic stroke is increased by use of a combined OCP. Use progesterone-only or non-hormonal contraception in migraine + aura, though a low dose combined OCP can be used in those without aura. 

Further risk: 
- Smoking 
- Age >35yrs 
- ↑BP 
- Obesity (body mass index >30) 
- Diabetes mellitus 
- Hyperlipidaemia 
- Family history of arteriopathy <45yrs. 

Warn patients to stop OCP at once if they develop aura or worsening migraine; see OHCS p301. 

Perimenstrual migraine: If uncontrolled with standard treatment and the onset of headache is predictable then consider frovatriptan 2.5mg BD or zolmitriptan 2.5mg BD/TDS on the days migraine is expected. 

Pregnancy: Migraine often improves; if not, get help—worsening headaches in pregnancy are associated with a greater risk of pre-eclampsia and cardiovascular complications. Offer paracetamol 1st line. Triptans and NSAIDs can be used but discuss risks and benefits with patients first. Don't use aspirin if breastfeeding. Anti-emetic: cyclizine or promethazine. Prophylaxis: seek specialist advice.
