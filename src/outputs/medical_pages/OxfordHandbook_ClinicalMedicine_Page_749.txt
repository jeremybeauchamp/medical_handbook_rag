Fig 16.18 T2-weighted sagittal MRI of the cervical spine. There is impingement of the spinal cord at the C4/5 and C5/6 levels caused by degenerative disease. C2 (axis) is identifiable from the odontoid peg, which is embryologically derived from the body of C1 (atlas).

Fig 16.19 Axial T1-weighted MRI of the brain post-IV gadolinium. In the right temporo-parietal region there is a small area of high signal enhancement with a more central area of low signal, surrounded by a region of low signal (presumably vasogenic cerebral oedema) in comparison to the normal brain tissue. This is all causing mass effect with effacement of the sulci and adjacent right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. There is very subtle midline shift.

Fig 16.20 Axial T2-weighted MRI of the same patient at the same level as Fig 16.19. The high signal in the temporo-parietal region is the oedema causing mass effect. The diagnosis was of a solitary metastasis. In this T2-weighted image the oedema and the cerebrospinal fluid are of high signal due to their water content.
