# The differential white cell count

## Neutrophils (figs 8.19, 8.20) 2-7.5 × 10⁹/L (40-75% of white blood cells: but absolute values are more meaningful than percentages).

### Increased in (ie neutrophilia):
- Bacterial infections.
- Inflammation, eg myocardial infarction, polyarteritis nodosa.
- Myeloproliferative disorders.
- Drugs (steroids).
- Disseminated malignancy.
- Stress, eg trauma, surgery, burns, haemorrhage, seizure.

### Decreased in (ie neutropenia—see p352):
- Viral infections.
- Drugs: post-chemotherapy, cytotoxic agents, carbimazole, sulfonamides.
- Severe sepsis.
- Neutrophil antibodies (SLE, haemolytic anaemia)—↑destruction.
- Hypersplenism (p373), eg Felty's syndrome (p698).
- Bone marrow failure—↓production (p364).

### Other neutrophil responses to infection: 
These include: • vacuoles in the cytoplasm (the most specific sign of bacterial infection); • Döhle bodies: inconspicuous grey-blue areas of cytoplasm (residual ribosomes). Up to 17% of neutrophils from females show a drumstick-shaped Barr body (arrow, fig 8.20d). It is the inactivated X chromosome.

## Lymphocytes (fig 8.21) 1.5-4.5 × 10⁹/L (20-45%).

### Increased in (ie lymphocytosis):
- Acute viral infections.
- Chronic infections, eg TB, brucellosis, hepatitis, syphilis.
- Leukaemias and lymphomas, especially chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

Large numbers of abnormal ('atypical') lymphocytes are characteristically seen with EBV infection: these are T cells reacting against EBV-infected B cells. They have a large amount of clearish cytoplasm with a blue rim that flows around neighbouring RBCs. Other causes of 'atypical' lymphocytes: see p405.

### Decreased in (ie lymphopenia):
- Steroid therapy; SLE; uraemia; Legionnaire's disease; HIV infection; marrow infiltration; post chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

T-lymphocyte subset reference values: CD4 count: 537-1571/mm³ (low in HIV infection). CD8 count: 235-753/mm³; CD4/CD8 ratio: 1.2-3.8.

## Eosinophils (fig 8.22) 0.04-0.4 × 10⁹/L (1-6%).

### Increased in (ie eosinophilia):
- Drug reactions, eg with erythema multiforme, p562.
- Allergies: asthma, atopy.
- Parasitic infections (especially invasive helminths).
- Skin disease: especially pemphigus, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis.

Also seen in malignant disease (including lymphomas and eosinophilic leukaemia), PAN, adrenal insufficiency, irradiation, Löffler's syndrome (p704), Churg-Strauss syndrome (p696) and during the convalescent phase of any infection.

The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) occurs when eosinophila >1.5 × 10⁹/L is sustained for >6 weeks leading to end-organ damage (endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy, skin lesions, thromboembolic disease, lung disease, neuropathy, and hepatosplenomegaly). The cause is often unknown, though if FIP1L1-PDFRA genotype, diagnose myeloproliferative HES or eosinophilic leukaemia. ℞: PO steroids ± mepolizumab (anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody). Imatinib is 1st choice for myoproliferative HES.

## Monocytes (fig 8.23) 0.2-0.8 × 10⁹/L (2-10%). 
### Increased in (ie monocytosis): 
The aftermath of chemo- or radiotherapy, chronic infections (eg malaria, TB, brucellosis, protozoa), malignant disease (including M4 and M5 acute myeloid leukaemia (p356), and Hodgkin's disease), myelodysplasia.

## Basophils (fig 8.24) 0-0.1 × 10⁹/L (0-1%). 
### Increased in (ie basophilia): 
Myeloproliferative disease, viral infections, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions (eg urticaria, hypothyroidism), and inflammatory disorders (eg UC, rheumatoid arthritis).
