ECG showing acute postero-lateral MI

RHYTHM STRIP: II
25 mm/sec: 1 cm/mV

Fig 3.24 Acute postero-lateral MI. The posterior infarct is evidenced by the reciprocal changes seen in V1-3: dominant R waves ('upside-down' pathological Q waves) and ST depression ('upside-down' ST elevation). If extra chest leads were added (V7-9), we would see the classic ST elevation pattern, see p 98. The ST elevation in V6 suggests lateral infarction. A blockage in the circumflex coronary artery could explain both the posterior and lateral changes.
