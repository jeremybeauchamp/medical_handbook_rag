# Nuclear medicine

The majority of medical imaging is concerned with passing external waves (eg radiation) through the patient to a detector, and measuring scatter, slowing, or other alterations by various tissues. Nuclear medicine is the opposite; it measures emitted radiation from an internal source, introduced into the patient via injection, inhalation, or ingestion. It can be diagnostic (eg PET scanning) or therapeutic (eg radioiodine (I131) ablation in thyrotoxicosis).

Because molecules labelled with radioisotopes are introduced into the patient, there is exposure to ionizing radiation, though doses are usually less than those from CT (see table 16.1, p719). The selection of molecule for labelling depends on the tissue of interest, as it should be something that will be readily taken up by that tissue, eg bisphosphonates for bone, glucose for fast-turnover tissue. Examples include:

## Ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan
Uses inhaled technetium (Tc) or, less commonly, xenon-133 (133Xe) plus injected 99mTc macro-aggregates, which lodge in lung capillaries. Normal perfusion excludes PE but ventilation component requires a normal CXR for comparison (figs 16.25, 16.26). Due to the large number of 'indeterminate' scans VQ is considered inferior to CTPA for the investigation of PE except in pregnancy (see p192).

## Bone scintigraphy
99mTc-labelled bisphosphonates are readily taken up by bone, and concentrate in areas of pathology, eg tumours, fractures. It is much more sensitive in identifying metastases than X-ray, where lesions may not appear until >50% of bone matrix has been destroyed (fig 16.27).

## Thyroid disease
TcO4 is used for differentiating Graves', toxic multinodular goitre, and subacute thyroiditis (fig 13.22, p601) as well as identifying ectopic tissue, functioning nodules, and residual/recurrent thyroid tissue after surgery. ~15% of cold (non-functioning) nodules are malignant. Hot nodules are often toxic adenomas.

## Phaeochromocytoma
Iodine-123 (123I) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is taken up by sympathetic tissues, and indicates functioning, ectopic, and metastatic adrenal medullary (+other neural crest) tumours. 131I-MIBG is also used for treatment.

## Hyperparathyroidism
99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) scans can detect parathyroid adenomas.

## Haemorrhage
Red cells are removed from the patient and labelled with 99mTc, then reinjected to allow identification of a bleeding point. Used in both acute (after endoscopy and CT) and chronic GI bleeding, red cell scans are more sensitive than CT angiography and useful in intermittent bleeding, although localization can be challenging.
