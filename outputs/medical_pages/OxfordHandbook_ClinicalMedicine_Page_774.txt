# Placing IV cannulae

Much of what we do is not evidence based; however, in more recent years, particularly in intensive care units, the rise of hospital-acquired infections and multidrug-resistant organisms has prompted a review of standard practice and a series of evidence-based interventions put together as a 'care bundle' to reduce hospital-acquired infections. The technique for placing a cannula is best shown at the bedside by an expert, but following these simple rules will significantly reduce the risk of infection from the cannula.

## Preparation is key, remember the following before you start

1. **Equipment**: Set up a tray with cleaning swabs, gauze, cannulae (swallow your pride and take at least three of different sizes, see table 18.1), dressings, 0.9% saline, 10mL syringe, needle-free adaptor (eg octopus with bionector), blood tubes if required, portable sharps bin → needlestick injuries do happen.

2. **Patient**: Have them lying down, explain procedure, obtain verbal consent, place tourniquet around arm, rest the arm below the heart to aid venous filling.

3. **Site**: Look for the best vein—it should be palpable; some of the best veins are not easily visible, some of the most visible collapse on insertion. Tapping gently helps.
   - Never cannulate: AV fistulae arms, limbs with lymphoedema.
   - Avoid: Sites crossing a joint (if possible), the cephalic vein in a renal patient.

4. **Consider**: EMLA® cream, cold spray, or 1% lidocaine for children or those with needle phobia. EMLA® takes 45min to work, but can save you hassle later.

## Insertion care bundle

1. Aseptic technique.
2. Hand hygiene.
3. Apron + non-sterile gloves.
4. Skin preparation—2% chorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol (allow to dry for 30 seconds). Do not repalpate vein after cleaning unless wearing sterile gloves.
5. Dressing—sterile and transparent so that insertion site can be observed.

## After insertion

1. Take blood with syringe or adaptor.
2. Remove tourniquet.
3. Attach needle-free device (if appropriate) and flush with 10mL 0.9% saline.
4. Apply dressing.
5. Let nursing staff know that cannula is in place and ready for use.
6. Document insertion according to local policy.
7. Write up appropriate fluids or parenteral medication.

When seeing your patient on the daily ward round (and to avoid being called to review or replace cannulae at 6pm) do a RAID assessment: consider if the drip is:

- **R**equired—can the patient manage with oral medication/fluids?
- **A**ppropriate—should you consider a PICC, central line, long-term line, etc?
- **I**nfected—any signs of inflammation or infection? Remove if yes. Peripheral cannulae should be replaced every 72–96 hours.
- **D**ressed properly—many drips are replaced early because they have 'fallen out', or are kinked from poor dressings.

Tissued or infected cannulae need replacing, either with another peripheral cannula, or with a longer-term access device, such as a PICC line.

## If you fail after three attempts

Shocked patients need fluid quickly: if you are having trouble putting in a drip, call your senior. The following advice assumes that the drip is not immediately life-saving. If it is, see BOX.

- Ask for help—from colleagues or seniors—do not be ashamed, everyone has to learn and even senior doctors have bad days; a fresh pair of eyes can be all it takes. As a house officer, one of us was asked to place a drip when a very shame-faced consultant had 'had a go' to prove he still could, and found out that he couldn't!

- Help yourself—try putting the hand in warm water, using a small amount of GTN paste over the vein, or using ultrasound if available to help you identify the vein.

- If there is no one else to help, take a break and come back in half an hour. Veins come and go, and coming back with fresh eyes can make all the difference.
