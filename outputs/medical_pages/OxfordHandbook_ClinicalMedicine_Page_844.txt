## Raised intracranial pressure (ICP)

The volume inside the cranium is fixed, so any increase in the contents can lead to raised ICP. This can be mass effect, oedema, or obstruction to fluid outflow. Normal ICP in adults is <15mmHg.

### Causes
- Primary or metastatic tumours.
- Head injury.
- Haemorrhage (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular).
- Infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess.
- Hydrocephalus.
- Cerebral oedema.
- Status epilepticus.

### Signs and symptoms
- Headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting.
- Altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma.
- History of trauma.
- HR and BP (Cushing's response); Cheyne-Stokes respiration.
- Pupil changes (constriction at first, later dilation—do not mask these signs by using agents such as tropicamide to dilate the pupil to aid fundoscopy).
- Visual acuity; peripheral visual field loss.
- Papilloedema is an unreliable sign, but venous pulsation at the disc may be absent (absent in ~50% of normal people, but loss of it is a useful sign).

### Investigations
- U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture.
- Consider toxicology screen.
- CXR—any source of infection that might indicate abscess?
- CT head.
- Then consider LP if safe. Measure the opening pressure!

### Management
See fig 19.22. The goal is to ↓ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent neurosurgery is required for the definitive treatment of ↑ICP from focal causes (eg haematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or bolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in fig 19.22.

### Herniation syndromes

**Uncal herniation** is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsilateral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against the midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a dilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a fixed pupil localizes a lesion poorly but is 'ipsilateralizing'). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis (pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) in the midbrain.

**Cerebellar tonsil herniation** is caused by ↑pressure in the posterior fossa forcing the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and upgoing plantar reflexes occur first, then loss of consciousness, irregular breathing, and apnoea. This syndrome may proceed very rapidly given the small size of, and poor compliance in, the posterior fossa.

**Subfalcian (cingulate) herniation** is caused by a frontal mass. The cingulate gyrus (medial frontal lobe) is forced under the rigid falx cerebri. It may be silent unless the anterior cerebral artery is compressed and causes a stroke—eg contralateral leg weakness ± abulia (lack of decision-making).
