# Acute coronary syndrome—without ST-elevation

First stabilize with medical therapy; early risk stratification will identify those in need of further treatment and prompt angiography (involve cardiologists).4

## Assessment
**Brief history:** (See p36.) Previous angina, relief with rest/nitrates, history of cardiovascular disease, risk factors for IHD.

**Examination:** (See p38.) Pulse, BP, JVP, cardiac murmurs, signs of heart failure, peripheral pulses, scars from previous cardiac surgery.

**Investigations** ECG: ST depression; flat or inverted T-waves; or normal; FBC, U&E, troponin, glucose, random cholesterol; CXR.

## Management
See fig 19.6 for acute management, but p796 if ST elevation. The aim of therapy is to control pain then initiate anti-ischaemic and antiplatelet therapy.

**Oral antiplatelet therapy:** Aspirin 300mg PO, followed by 75mg OD. For those with confirmed ACS give a second antiplatelet agent, eg clopidogrel (300mg PO then 75mg OD PO). Ticagrelor (180mg then 90mg/12h PO) is a prefered alternative, particularly in higher risk groups5 (eg • ≥60yrs age •previous stroke, TIA, MI, or CABG •known coronary artery stenosis ≥50% in ≥2 vessels or carotid stenosis ≥50% •DM •peripheral arterial disease •chronic kidney disease). Prasugrel (60mg then 10mg/d PO) is an alternative to clopidogrel for those undergoing PCI. In practice, if the history is typical but ECG changes are non-diagnostic and troponin results are awaited, treatment with eg clopridogrel is often given on clinical suspicion; if troponin testing then confirms ACS, it is still appropriate to give either ticagrelor or prasugrel to those patients in whom it is indicated, even if clopidogrel has already been given.

**Anticoagulation:** Ideally fondaparinux (factor Xa inhibitor) 2.5mg OD; if not available, use low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, eg enoxaparin 1mg/kg/12h) or unfractionated heparin (aim APTT 50-70s) until discharge.

**β-blockers:** In higher-risk patients with no contraindications (consider diltiazem as alternative). Do not use β-blockers with verapamil—can precipitate asystole.

**Nitrates (PO or IV):** For recurrent chest pain.

**ACE-i:** Should be given to all patients unless there are CI (monitor renal function).

**Lipid management:** Start early, eg atorvastatin 80mg OD (see p120).

## Prognosis
Overall risk of death ~1-2%, but ~15% for refractory angina despite medical therapy. Risk stratification can help predict those most at risk and allow intervention to be targeted at those individuals: calculate using GRACE score.2 The following are associated with an increased risk:
- History of unstable angina.
- ST depression or widespread T-wave inversion.
- Raised troponin (except patients with ST elevation MI).
- Age >70 years.
- General comorbidity, previous MI, poor LV function or DM.

High-risk patients should be considered for inpatient coronary angiography. Symptomatic lesions may be addressed by coronary stenting or CABG (see p123).

## Further measures
- Wean off glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion when stabilized on oral drugs.
- Continue fondaparinux (or LMWH or heparin) until discharge.
- Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia. Check serial ECGs, and troponin >12h after pain.
- Address modifiable risk factors: smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes.
- Gentle mobilization.
- Ensure patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, β-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin.

If symptoms recur, refer to cardiologist for urgent angiography & PCI or CABG.

2 GRACE = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Risk is scored based on age, heart rate, BP, renal function, Killip class of heart failure, and other events, eg raised troponin. Very complicated to calculate so recommendation by European Society of Cardiology is to use an online calculator, eg http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/.
