### Fig 16.2   Lower lobe collapse (right lung). The right heart border is obscured. Volume loss in the right lower zone results in a hyper-expanded right upper lobe that is more radiolucent than the left upper lobe.

| Fig 16.2 | X-ray image of the chest showing lower lobe collapse in the right lung. The right heart border is not visible. The right upper lobe appears more radiolucent (darker) compared to the left upper lobe due to hyper-expansion caused by volume loss in the right lower zone. |
| Fig 16.3 | Chest X-ray demonstrating 'Bat's wing' appearance, which is characteristic of peri-hilar pulmonary oedema. This finding is indicative of heart failure and fluid overload. The image shows increased opacity in the central portions of both lungs, spreading outwards in a pattern resembling bat wings. |
