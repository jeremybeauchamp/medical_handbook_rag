Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis demonstrated the benefits of handwashing in the 1840s: he observed that maternal mortality was nearly three times as high on a doctor-run maternity ward compared to a midwife-run ward. The explanation remained elusive until Semmelweis' friend Jakob Kolletschka died after receiving an accidental scalpel cut from a student during a post-mortem demonstration. Semmelweis recognized in Kolletschka's death many of the features of the dying mothers. The explanation: the maternity ward doctors' day started with post-mortem examinations, from which they would procede to perform vaginal examinations on the living without washing their hands. Noticing this, Semmelweis introduced the practice of washing hands with chloride of lime and cut death rates to that of the midwives' patients. Despite the evidence he amassed, Semmelweis's theory was rejected by his contemporaries, a rejection which undoubtedly contributed to his psychiatric distress, eventual commitment to an asylum, and ultimate death from the blows of his guards. It would take another 20 years and countless deaths before Lister published his landmark work on the use of carbolic acid in surgery.

Take a minute to wash your hands thoroughly before undertaking any procedure. This prerequisite will not only reduce infection risk for your patients, but give you a moment for mindfulness: focus on the hot water running over your hands, breathe deeply, and for a while forget about your list of jobs. Perhaps spare Dr Kolletschka a thought. You may find that the subsequent procedure goes more smoothly than anticipated.

## Training and the business of medicine

As medical training has evolved in an environment where patient safety is paramount, the old adage of 'see one, do one, teach one' is no longer relevant. 'Just having a go' when you aren't confident can have devastating consequences for the patient, and also for you and your future. This creates tensions for training, but these are not insurmountable. Seek out opportunities to learn practical procedures, ideally in a controlled, elective setting, so that your first attempt isn't a life-or-death emergency attempt—time spent in theatres or ICU will pay dividends in this regard. Many seniors will be happy to make time to teach if you contact them in advance—let them know you are interested and leave your bleep. Even in an emergency setting, it is still wiser to seek help rather than attempting an urgent procedure for the first time.
