## Digoxin
Blocks the Na+/K+ pump. It is used to slow the pulse in fast AF (p130; aim for ≤100). As it is a weak +ve inotrope, its role in heart failure in sinus rhythm may be best reserved if symptomatic despite optimal ACE-i therapy;10 here there is little benefit vis-à-vis mortality (but admissions for worsening CCF are ↓ by ~25%).11 Elderly people are at risk of toxicity: use lower doses. Measure plasma levels >6h post-dose (p756). Typical dose: 500mcg stat PO, repeated after 12h, then 125mcg (if elderly) to 250mcg/d PO OD (62.5mcg/d is almost never enough). IV dose: 0.75–1mg in 0.9% NaCl over 2h. ↑Toxicity risk if: ↓K+, ↓Mg2+, or ↑Ca2+. t½ ≈ 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy in cardioversion (start at 5J). ►If on amiodarone, halve the dose of digoxin. SEs: Any arrhythmia (supraventricular tachycardia with AV block is suggestive), nausea, ↓appetite, yellow vision, confusion, gynaecomastia. If toxicity is suspected, do an ECG (fig 3.19), digoxin levels, and check K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. If toxicity is confirmed, stop digoxin, correct electrolyte imbalances, treat arrhythmias, and consider IV DigiFab® (p842). CIs: HCM; WPW syndrome (p133).

| V5 | Fig 3.19 This ECG shows the classic 'reverse tick' of digoxin toxicity: downsloping ST wave with rapid upstroke back to isoelectric line. The bradycardia is also suggestive of digoxin toxicity. |

## Sodium channel blockers
Class I anti-arrhythmics. Procainamide (1a) and lidocaine (1b) can be used to terminate VT. NB QT interval may be prolonged. Flecainide (1c) is useful for AF cardioversion in patients without contraindications, and for arrhythmia prophylaxis in patients with WPW or troublesome paroxysmal AF. CIs: Heart failure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block.

## Amiodarone
A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action potential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventricular and ventricular tachycardias, including during cardiac arrest. Broad range of side effects incl. thyroid disease, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis and peripheral neuropathy. Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months.

## Ivabradine
Blocks the pacemaker 'funny current', slowing pulse rate without significantly dropping blood pressure. Used in angina, heart failure, and (off-licence) in autonomic tachycardia syndromes. CIs: Acute MI, bradycardia, long QT syndrome, shock. Many drug interactions, including with calcium antagonists.

## Statins
Statins (eg simvastatin, p690) inhibit the enzyme HMG-COA reductase, which causes de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor expression by hepatocytes leading to ↓circulating LDL cholesterol. More effective if given at night, but optimum dose and target plasma cholesterol are unknown. SEs: Muscle aches, abdominal discomfort, ↑transaminases (eg ALT), ↑CK, myositis, rarely rhabdomyolysis (more common if used with fibrates). Statins are generally well tolerated. There are currently ~3 million people taking statins in England, which saves ~10 000 lives a year. See also hyperlipidaemia, pp690–1, fig 14.13.

## Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node

Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AVN) include digoxin, verapamil, and adenosine. Uses include cardioverting AVNRT and diagnosing atrial tachycardias.

Drugs that slow AVN conduction should be avoided in patients with aberrant pathways (eg WPW) as blocking the AVN can increase conduction via the alternative pathways. AVN blockers are contraindicated in patients with or at risk of VT, eg those with long QT syndrome.
