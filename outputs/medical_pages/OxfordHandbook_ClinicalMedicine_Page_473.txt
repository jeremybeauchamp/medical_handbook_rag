# What is going on in migraine?

Despite the high prevalence of migraines, the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. The previously favoured theory of dilatation of cerebral and meningeal arteries has been largely disproven, so what is the cause?

- MRI during attacks shows episodic cerebral oedema, dilatation of intracerebral vessels, and ↓water diffusion not respecting vascular territories, so the primary event may be neurological.
- PET suggests migraine is a subcortical disorder affecting the modulation of sensory processing
- Magneto-encephalographic (MEG) studies have shown resting (interictal) hyperexcitability at least in the visual cortex, suggesting a failure of inhibitory circuits.
- Hormones play a role: the incidence of migraine in both pre-pubertal and post-menopausal women is equal to men, yet increases to 3:1 during reproductive years, with 50% of females reporting synchrony of migraines with the menstrual cycle.
- Elevated levels of 5-HT metabolites in the urine of patients during migraine attacks was first reported in 1972, and while its exact significance is controversial, the efficacy of triptans (5HT1B/1D agonists) support its role in migraine.
- Triptans also inhibit release of substance P and pro-inflammatory neuropeptides, blocking transmission from the trigeminal nerve and implicating trigeminal nerve dysfunction.

## The bigger picture

Vincent Van Gogh suffered from 'sick headaches', widely believed to have been migraines. Could his swirling, cascading starry night (fig 10.10) be a visual aura?

Just as with the fragile mental health of Van Gogh, migraine often co-exists with other chronic conditions—and the combined negative impact on physical and mental health is immense. Don't treat each disease in isolation. Rather, attempt to restore a good relationship with the self—and the recovery of the purpose of life through dialogue. This is the hardest but the most rewarding task, and may save some ears.

The image shows a painting of a night sky with swirling stars and a crescent moon. The sky is dark blue with yellow stars and swirling patterns. In the foreground, there's a dark silhouette of what appears to be a town with a prominent spire or tower.
