- **The normal (Gaussian) distribution curve.** This bell-shaped graph (fig 17.2) is the theoretical basis of reference intervals, and explains 'lab error'—why some tests repeated at close intervals may reveal slightly different values. Hb for example, has a lab error of ~5g/L. This emphasizes the importance of the clinical picture in decision-making, rather than treating the numbers alone: don't subject anaemic patients to blood transfusions unless they have a clinical need. See p324.

- **Range** is the lowest and highest value of all observations in the set being studied.

- **Arithmetic mean** is the sum of all observations ÷ by the number of observations.

- **Median** is the middle value (eg 9 data points are higher and 9 are lower). If their distribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean.

- **Standard deviation (SD)** is the square root of the variance (the average of the square of the distance of each data point from the mean). When the distribution of the observations is Normal, 95% of observations are located in the interval 'mean ± 1.96 SD'. This is the basis of the reference interval.

- **Standard error of the mean** gives an estimate of the reliability of the mean of a sample representing the mean of the population from which the sample was taken, and is the SD of the sample ÷ by the square root of the number of observations in the sample. Thus the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error of the mean—the basis of ensuring that clinical trial evidence is based upon enough observations to be confident that differences seen between groups do not occur by chance alone.
