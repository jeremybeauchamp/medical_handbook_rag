# Motor neuron disease (MND)

MND is a cluster of neurodegenerative diseases affecting 6/100 000 (♂:♀≈3:2), characterized by selective loss of neurons in motor cortex, cranial nerve nuclei, and anterior horn cells. Upper and lower motor neurons can be affected but there is no sensory loss or sphincter disturbance, thus distinguishing MND from MS and polyneuropathies. MND never affects eye movements, distinguishing it from myasthenia (p512). There are four clinical patterns:

1. **ALS/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.** (Archetypal MND; up to 80%.) Loss of motor neurons in motor cortex and the anterior horn of the cord, so combined UMN + LMN signs (p446). Worse prognosis if: bulbar onset, ↑age; ↓FVC.

2. **Progressive bulbar palsy.** (10-20%.) Only affects cranial nerves IX-XII. See BOX 'Bulbar and corticobulbar ('pseudobulbar') palsy'.

3. **Progressive muscular atrophy.** (<10%.) Anterior horn cell lesion, so LMN signs only. Affects distal muscle groups before proximal. Better prognosis than ALS.

4. **Primary lateral sclerosis.** (Rare.) Loss of Betz cells in motor cortex: mainly UMN signs, marked spastic leg weakness and pseudobulbar palsy. No cognitive decline.

## Presentation
Think of MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stumbling spastic gait, foot-drop ± proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don't turn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is hard), or aspiration pneumonia. Look for UMN signs: spasticity, brisk reflexes, ↑plantars; and LMN signs: wasting, fasciculation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh. Is speech or swallowing affected (bulbar signs)? Fasciculation is not enough to diagnose an LMN lesion: look for weakness too. Frontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25% (see BOX 'Dignity and Dignitas').

## Diagnostic criteria
(See BOX 'Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS'). There is no diagnostic test. Brain/cord MRI helps exclude structural causes, LP helps exclude inflammatory ones, and neurophysiology can detect subclinical denervation and help exclude mimicking motor neuropathies.¹⁴

## Prognosis
Poor, <3yrs post onset in half of patients.

## Management
Adopt a multidisciplinary approach: neurologist, palliative nurse, hospice, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services—all orchestrated by the GP. Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release and NMDA receptor antagonist, is the only medication shown to improve survival. Multiple other drugs that have shown promise in animal models have failed to prove benefit in clinical trials, including neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic agents, antioxidants, and immunomodulatory drugs. For supportive/symptomatic treatment:

- **Excess saliva:** Advise on positioning, oral care, and suctioning. Try an antimuscarinic (eg propantheline) or glycopyrronium bromide (can be given SC). Botulinum toxin A may help.
- **Dysphagia:** Blend food. Gastrostomy is an option—discuss early on.
- **Spasticity:** Exercise, orthotics. See MS for drugs (p496).
- **Communication difficulty:** Provide 'augmentative and alternative' communication equipment.
- **End-of-life care:** ►Involve palliative care team from diagnosis (p532). Consider opioids to relieve breathlessness and discuss non-invasive ventilation (see BOX 'Dignity and Dignitas').

¹⁴ If no UMN signs and distal arm muscles are affected in the distribution of individual nerves, suspect multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (diagnose on nerve conduction studies; Rx: IV Ig). Gynaecomastia, atrophic testes ± infertility suggests Kennedy syndrome (bulbospinal muscular atrophy).
