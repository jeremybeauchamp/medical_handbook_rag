# Transfusion reactions

All UK blood products are now leucocyte-depleted (white cells <5×106/L) so as to reduce the incidence of complications such as alloimmunization to HLA class I antigens and febrile transfusion reactions.

## Table 8.4 Management of transfusion reactions

| Reaction | Management |
|----------|------------|
| Acute haemolytic reaction<br>(eg ABO incompatibility) Agitation, T°<br>(rapid onset), ↓BP, flushing, abdominal/<br>chest pain, oozing venepuncture sites, DIC. | STOP transfusion. Check identity and<br>name on unit; tell haematologist; send<br>unit + FBC, U&E, clotting, cultures, & urine<br>(haemoglobinuria) to lab. Keep IV line<br>open with 0.9% saline. Treat DIC (p352). |
| Anaphylaxis<br>Bronchospasm, cyanosis, ↓BP, soft tissue<br>swelling. | STOP the transfusion. Maintain airway<br>and give oxygen. Contact anaesthetist.<br>➽See p794. |
| Bacterial contamination<br>T° (rapid onset), ↓BP, and rigors. | STOP the transfusion. Check identity<br>against name on unit; tell haematologist<br>and send unit + FBC, U&E, clotting, cultures<br>& urine to lab. Start broad-spectrum<br>antibiotics. |
| TRALI (See p348) Dyspnoea, cough; CXR<br>'white out'. | STOP the transfusion. Give 100% O2.<br>➽Treat as ARDS, p186. Donor should be<br>removed from donor panel. |
| Non-haemolytic febrile transfusion<br>reaction<br>Shivering and fever usually ½–1h after<br>starting transfusion. | SLOW or STOP the transfusion. Give an<br>antipyretic, eg paracetamol 1g. Monitor<br>closely. If recurrent, use WBC filter. |
| Allergic reactions<br>Urticaria and itch. | SLOW or STOP the transfusion; chlorphen-<br>amine 10mg slow IV/IM. Monitor closely. |
| Fluid overload<br>Dyspnoea, hypoxia, tachycardia, ↑JVP and<br>basal crepitations. | SLOW or STOP the transfusion. Give oxygen<br>and a diuretic, eg furosemide 40mg IV<br>initially. Consider CVP line. |

## Blood transfusion and Jehovah's Witnesses

Adult human beings (with mental 'capacity' see p568) have an absolute right to refuse any medical treatment, even if to do so seems illogical or could result in their death. To treat patients despite such a refusal would amount to battery under common law, or could even amount to a degrading act or torture, against which the European Convention on Human Rights gives absolute, inalienable protection.

The biblical verse 'no soul of you shall eat blood' (Leviticus 17:12) is one of several that have been interpreted by some religious groups to extend to acceptance of blood products in a medical context. Jehovah's Witnesses, for example, may refuse potentially vital blood transfusions on such grounds. These views must be respected, but complex issues arise if the patient is a child, or an adult who may not be able to give or withhold consent in an informed way. In an immediately life-threatening situation where further delay may cause harm, treatment such as blood products may be given in the child's best interest, but the team should always involve senior paediatricians and hospital ethicists where practical. If the requirement is less immediate, then the clinicians should seek further legal advice, which might involve approaching the Courts.
