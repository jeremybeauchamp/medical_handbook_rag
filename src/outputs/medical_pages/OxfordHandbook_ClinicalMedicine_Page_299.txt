## Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)

The commonest liver disorder in Western industrialized countries (prevalence≈20%), NAFLD represents fat in hepatocytes (steatosis) visualized, eg on ultrasound that cannot be attributed to other causes (most commonly alcohol so consider NAFLD if drink <18U/wk, <9U). If inflammation is also present (LFT, typically ALT) = non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Rule out other causes of liver disease (p284) and check for associated metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension). Progression to cirrhosis may occur—biopsy or elastography may be needed (p248).

### Risk factors for progression
Older age; obesity; DM; NASH.

### Treatment
Control risk factors, including obesity (bariatic surgery helps). Address cardiovascular risk (commonest cause of death, see p93). Avoid alcohol consumption. No drug is of proven benefit, though vitamin E may improve histology in fibrosis (eg 400IU/d—higher doses associated with excess mortality).

### Follow-up
Monitor for complications (NASH, cirrhosis, DM). If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly.

## Wilson's disease/hepatolenticular degeneration

Wilson's disease is a rare (3/100 000) inherited disorder of copper excretion with excess deposition in liver and CNS (eg basal ganglia). It is treatable, so screen all with cirrhosis.

### Genetics
An autosomal recessive disorder of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B.

### Physiology
Total body copper content is ~125mg. Intake ≈ 3mg/day (absorbed in proximal small intestine). In the liver, copper is incorporated into caeruloplasmin. In Wilson's disease, copper incorporation into caeruloplasmin in hepatocytes and excretion into bile are impaired. Copper accumulates in liver, and later in other organs.

### Signs
Children present with liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, fulminant liver failure); young adults often start with CNS signs: tremor; dysarthria, dysphagia; dyskinesias; dystonias; dementia; Parkinsonism; ataxia/clumsiness.

**Mood:** Depression/mania; labile emotions; ↑libido; personality change. Ignoring these may cause years of needless misery: often the doctor who is good at combining the analytical and integrative aspects will be the first to make the diagnosis.

**Cognition:** ↓Memory; slow to solve problems; ↓IQ; delusions; mutism.

**Kayser–Fleischer (KF) rings:** Copper in iris (see 6 in following list); they are not invariable.

**Also:** Haemolysis; blue lunulae (nails); arthritis; hypermobile joints; grey skin.

### Tests
Equivocal copper studies need expert interpretation.

1. **Urine:** 24h copper excretion is high, eg >100mcg/24h (normal <40mcg).
2. **LFT:** non-specific (but ALT >1500 is not part of the picture).
3. **Serum copper:** typically <11μmol/L.
4. **↓Serum caeruloplasmin:** <200mg/L (<140mg/L is pathognomonic)—beware incidental low values in protein-deficiency states (eg nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption).
5. **Molecular genetic testing** can confirm the diagnosis.
6. **Slit lamp exam:** KF rings: in iris/Descemet's membrane (fig 5.42 OHCS p452).
7. **Liver biopsy:** ↑Hepatic copper (copper >250mcg/g dry weight); hepatitis; cirrhosis.
8. **MRI:** degeneration in basal ganglia, fronto-temporal, cerebellar, and brainstem.

### Management
**Diet:** Avoid foods with high copper content (eg liver, chocolate, nuts, mushrooms, legumes, and shellfish). Check water sources (eg wells, pipes) for copper.

**Drugs:** Lifelong penicillamine (500mg/6–8h PO for 1yr, maintenance 0.75–1g/d). SEs: nausea, rash, ↓WCC, ↓Hb, ↓platelets, haematuria, nephrosis, lupus. Monitor FBC and urinary copper and protein excretion.

**Liver transplantation:** (See p277.) If severe liver disease.

**Screen siblings:** Asymptomatic homozygotes need treating.

### Prognosis
Pre-cirrhotic liver disease is reversible; CNS damage less so. There are no clear clinical prognostic indicators. Fatal events: liver failure, bleeding, infection.
