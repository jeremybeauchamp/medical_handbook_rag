# The 'safe triangle' for insertion of a chest drain

Fig 18.7

The safe 'triangle' is not really a triangle, as the axilla cuts off the point of the triangle. Draw a line along the lateral border of pectoralis major, a line along the anterior border of latissimus dorsi, and a line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple. The apex of the triangle is the axilla. Often chest drains are inserted directly under ultrasound guidance, or with a pre-marked spot; however, in an emergency or for aspiration, the landmarks of the safe triangle are important to know.

## Complications
- Thoracic or abdominal organ injury.
- Lymphatic damage → chylothorax.
- Damage to long thoracic nerve of Bell → wing scapula.
- Rarely, arrhythmia.

## Watch out for:
- Retrograde flow back into the chest.
- Persistent bubbling—there may be a continual leak from the lung.
- Blockage of the tube from clots or kinking—no swinging or bubbling.
- Malposition—check position with CXR.

# Relieving a tension pneumothorax

## Symptoms
Acute respiratory distress, chest pain, respiratory arrest.

## Signs
Hypotension; distended neck veins; asymmetrical lung expansion; trachea and apex deviated away from side of reduced air entry and hyperresonance to percussion. There is no time for a CXR (but see fig 16.43, p749).

## Aim
To release air from the pleural space. In a tension pneumothorax, air is drawn into the intrapleural space with each breath, but cannot escape due to a valve-like effect of the tiny flap in the parietal pleura. The increasing pressure progressively embarrasses the heart and the other lung.

**100% oxygen.**

## Procedure
- Insert a large-bore IV cannula (eg Venflon®) usually through the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line or the 'safe triangle' for chest drain insertion (see BOX 'The "safe triangle" for insertion'). Remove the stylet, allowing the trapped air to escape, usually with an audible hiss. This converts the tension pneumothorax to an open pneumothorax. Tape securely.
- Don't recover the cannula as tensioning will recur.
- Proceed to formal chest drain insertion (see p766).

# Aspiration of a pneumothorax

Identify the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line (or 4-6th intercostal space in the midaxillary line) and infiltrate with 1% lidocaine down to the pleura overlying the pneumothorax.

- Insert a 16G cannula into the pleural space. Remove the needle and connect the cannula to a 3-way tap and a 50mL syringe. Aspirate up to 2.5L of air (50mL×50). Stop if resistance is felt, or if the patient coughs excessively.
- Request a CXR to confirm resolution of the pneumothorax. If successful, consider discharging the patient and repeating the CXR after 24h to exclude recurrence, and again after 7-10d. Advise to avoid air travel for 6 weeks after a normal CXR. Diving should be permanently avoided.
- If aspiration is unsuccessful (in a significant, symptomatic pneumothorax), insert an intercostal drain (see p766).
