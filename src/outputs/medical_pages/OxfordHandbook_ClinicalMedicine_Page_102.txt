## Psychiatric assessment

Introduce yourself, ask a few factual questions (precise name, age, job, and who is at home). These may help your patient to relax, but be careful that you do not touch on a nerve, eg if job recently lost, marriage recently ended so living alone.

### Presenting problem
Ask for the main problems that have led to this consultation. Sit back and listen. Don't worry whether the information is in a convenient form or not—this is an opportunity for the patient to come out with worries, ideas, and preoccupations unsullied by your expectations. After >3-5min it is often good to aim to have a list of all the problems (each sketched only briefly). Read them back to the patient and ask if there are any more. Then ask about:

### History of presenting problem
For each problem obtain details, both current state and history of onset, precipitating factors, and effects on life.

### Check of major psychiatric symptoms
Check those that have not yet been covered: depression—low mood, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), thoughts of worthlessness/hopelessness, sleep disturbance with early morning waking, loss of weight and appetite. Ask specifically about suicidal thoughts and plans: 'Have you ever been so low that you thought of harming yourself?', 'What thoughts have you had?' Check for hypomanic and manic features which can be missed in a patient presenting as depressed. Hallucinations ('Have you ever heard voices or seen things when there hasn't been anyone or anything there?') and delusions ('Have you ever had any thoughts or beliefs that have struck you afterwards as bizarre?'); anxiety and avoidance behaviour (eg avoiding shopping because of anxiety or phobias); obsessional thoughts and compulsive behaviour, eating disorders, alcohol (see p281 for alcohol screening tests) and other drugs.

### Present circumstances
Housing, finance, work, relationships, friends.

### Family history
Ask about health, personality, and occupation of parents and siblings, and the family's medical and psychiatric history.

### Background history
Try to understand the context of the presenting problem.
- Biography: Relationships with family and peers as a child; school and work record; sexual relationships and current relationships; and family. Previous ways of dealing with stress and whether there have been problems and symptoms similar to the presenting ones.
- Premorbid personality: Mood, character, hobbies, attitudes, and beliefs.

### Past medical and psychiatric history
Establish any past or present co-morbidities.

### Mental state examination
This is the state now, at the time of interview.

Appearance: Clothing, glasses, headwear? Unkempt/normal/meticulous?

Observable behaviour: Eg excessive slowness, signs of anxiety, gesture, gaze or avoiding gaze, tears, laughter, pauses (while listening to voices?), attitude (eg withdrawn).

Mode of speech: Include the rate, eg retarded or gabbling (pressure of speech), rhythm, and tone of speech.

Mood: Note thoughts about harming self or others. Gauge your own responses to the patient. The laughter and grand ideas of manic patients are contagious, as to a lesser extent is the expression of thoughts from a depressed person.

Thoughts: Content: eg about himself, his own body, about other people, and the future, any suicidal ideation? Note abnormal beliefs (delusions), eg that thoughts are overheard, and abnormal ideas (eg persecutory, grandiose). Form: flight of ideas? Knight's move thinking? (See BOX 'Psychiatric symptoms'.)

Unusual experiences or hallucinations: Note modality, eg visual, auditory.

Cognition: Orientated in time, place, and person? Short-term memory: give a name and address and test recall after 5min. Draw the face of a clock (requires good frontal and parietal function). Long-term memory: current affairs recall. Name of current political leaders (p64). This tests many other CNS functions, not just memory.

Concentration: Months of the year backwards.

Insight: Does the patient think they are unwell? Do they think you can help?
