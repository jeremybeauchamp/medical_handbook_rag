Fig 6.2 Leucoplakia on the underside of the tongue. It is important to refer leucoplakia because it is premalignant.

Fig 6.3 An aphthous ulcer inside the cheek. The name is tautological: aphtha in Greek means ulceration.

Fig 6.4 White fur on an erythematous tongue caused by oral candidiasis. Oropharyngeal candidiasis in an apparently fit patient may suggest underlying HIV infection.
