# 670 Acid-base balance

Arterial blood pH is closely regulated in health to 7.40 ± 0.05 by various mechanisms including bicarbonate, other plasma buffers such as deoxygenated haemoglobin, and the kidney. Acid-base disorders needlessly confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied, then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. The key principle is that primary changes in HCO3- are *metabolic* and in CO2 *respiratory*. See fig 14.2.

## A simple method

1. Look at the pH, is there an acidosis or alkalosis?
   • pH <7.35 is an acidosis; pH >7.45 is an alkalosis.
2. Is the CO2 abnormal? (Normal range 4.7-6.0kPa.)
   If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?
   • CO2 is an acidic gas—is CO2 raised with an acidosis, lowered with an alkalosis?
     If so, it is in keeping with the pH and thus caused by a respiratory problem. If
     there is no change, or an opposite one, then the change is compensatory.
3. Is the HCO3- abnormal? (Normal concentration 22-28mmol/L.)
   If so, is the change in keeping with the pH?
   • HCO3- is alkaline—is HCO3- raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis?
     If so, the problem is a metabolic one.
4. Is the PaO2 abnormal? Interpret in the context of the FiO2.

### An example
Your patient's blood gas shows: pH 7.05, CO2 2.0kPa, HCO3- 8.0mmol/L.
There is an acidosis. The CO2 is low, and thus it is a compensatory change. The HCO3-
is low and is thus the primary change, ie a metabolic acidosis.

## The anion gap
Estimates unmeasured plasma anions ('fixed' or organic acids such as phosphate, ketones, and lactate—hard to measure directly). It is calculated as the difference between plasma cations (Na+ and K+) and anions (Cl- and HCO3-). Normal range: 10-18mmol/L. It is helpful in determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis.

## Metabolic acidosis ↓pH, ↓HCO3-

### Causes of metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap:
Due to increased production, or reduced excretion, of fixed/organic acids. HCO3- falls and unmeasured anions associated with the acids accumulate.
• Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia).
• Urate (renal failure).
• Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol).
• Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol).

### Causes of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap:
Due to loss of bicarbonate or ingestion of H+ ions (Cl- is retained).
• Renal tubular acidosis.
• Diarrhoea.
• Drugs (acetazolamide).
• Addison's disease.
• Pancreatic fistula.
• Ammonium chloride ingestion.

## Metabolic alkalosis ↑pH, ↑HCO3-
• Vomiting.
• K+ depletion (diuretics).
• Burns.
• Ingestion of base.

## Respiratory acidosis ↓pH, ↑CO2
• Type 2 respiratory failure due to any lung, neuromuscular, or physical cause (p188).
• Most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Look at the PaO2.
  It will probably be low. Is oxygen therapy required? Use controlled O2 (Venturi
  connector) if COPD is the underlying cause, as too much oxygen may make matters
  worse (p189).

**Beware exhaustion in asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema, which can present with this picture when close to respiratory arrest. A normal or high PaCO2 is worrying. These patients require urgent ITU review for ventilatory support.**
