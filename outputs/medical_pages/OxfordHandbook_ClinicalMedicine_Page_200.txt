## Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

ARDS, or acute lung injury, may be caused by direct lung injury or occur secondary to severe systemic illness. Lung damage and release of inflammatory mediators cause increased capillary permeability and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, often accompanied by multiorgan failure.

**Causes**
- Pulmonary: Pneumonia; gastric aspiration; inhalation; injury; vasculitis (p556); contusion. 
- Other: Shock; septicaemia; haemorrhage; multiple transfusions; DIC (p352); pancreatitis; acute liver failure; trauma; head injury; malaria; fat embolism; burns; obstetric events (eclampsia; amniotic fluid embolus); drugs/toxins (aspirin, heroin, paraquat).

**Clinical features** Cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; peripheral vasodilation; bilateral fine inspiratory crackles. 

**Investigations** FBC, U&E, LFT, amylase, clotting, CRP, blood cultures, ABG. CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonary artery catheter to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).

**Diagnostic criteria** One consensus requires these four to exist:
1. Acute onset.
2. CXR: bilateral infiltrates (fig 4.15). 
3. PCWP <19mmHg or a lack of clinical congestive heart failure. 
4. Refractory hypoxaemia with PaO2: FiO2 <200 for ARDS. 

Others include total thoracic compliance <30mL/cmH2O.

**Management** Admit to ITU; give supportive therapy; treat the underlying cause.

- **Respiratory support**: In early ARDS, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with 40-60% oxygen may be adequate to maintain oxygenation. But most patients need mechanical ventilation. Indications for ventilation: PaO2: <8.3kPa despite 60% O2; PaCO2: >6kPa. The large tidal volumes (10-15mL/kg) produced by conventional ventilation plus reduced lung compliance in ARDS may lead to high peak airway pressures ± pneumothorax. A low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either low or moderate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improves outcome.

- **Circulatory support**: Invasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and Swan-Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and cardiac output. A conservative fluid management approach improves outcome. Maintain cardiac output and O2 delivery with inotropes (eg dobutamine 2.5-10mcg/kg/min IVI), vasodilators, and blood transfusion. Consider treating pulmonary hypertension with low-dose (20-120 parts per million) nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodilator. Haemofiltration may be needed in renal failure and to achieve a negative fluid balance.

- **Sepsis**: Identify organism(s) and treat. If septic, but no organisms cultured, use empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (p167). Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics.

- **Other**: Nutritional support: enteral is best: p584 & p586, with high-fat, antioxidant formulations. Steroids protect those at risk of fat embolization and with pneumocystosis and may improve outcome in subacute ARDS. Their role in established ARDS is controversial.

**Prognosis** Overall mortality is 50-75%. Prognosis varies with age of patient, cause (pneumonia 86%, trauma 38%), and number of organs involved (three organs involved for >1wk is 'invariably' fatal).
