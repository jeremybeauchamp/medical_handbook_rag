Screen the following for abnormalities in thyroid function

- Patients with atrial fibrillation.
- Patients with hyperlipidaemia (4-14% have hypothyroidism).
- Diabetes mellitus—on annual review.
- Women with type 1 DM during 1st trimester and post delivery (3-fold rise in incidence of postpartum thyroid dysfunction).
- Patients on amiodarone or lithium (6 monthly).
- Patients with Down's or Turner's syndrome, or Addison's disease (yearly).

Table 5.2 Interpreting TFTs

| Hormone profile | Diagnosis |
|-----------------|-----------|
| ↑TSH, ↓T4 | Hypothyroidism |
| ↑TSH, normal T4 | Treated hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism (p221) |
| ↓TSH, ↑T4 | TSH-secreting tumour or thyroid hormone resistance |
| ↓TSH, ↑T4 and ↑T3 | Slow conversion of T4 to T3 (deiodinase deficiency; euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia*) or thyroid hormone antibody artefact |
| ↓TSH, ↑T4 or ↑T3 | Hyperthyroidism |
| ↓TSH, normal T4 and T3 | Subclinical hyperthyroidism |
| ↓TSH, ↓T4 | Central hypothyroidism (hypothalamic or pituitary disorder) |
| ↓TSH, ↓T4 and ↓T3 | Sick euthyroidism or pituitary disease |
| Normal TSH, abnormal T4 | Consider changes in thyroid-binding globulin, assay interference, amiodarone, or pituitary TSH tumour |

*In 'consumptive hypothyroidism' deiodinase activity is ↑↑; suspect if thyroxine doses have to be ↑↑.

Fig 5.13 The images are from an isotope scan, with and without markers placed over the sternal notch. We can see on the left that the nodule is metabolically inactive ('cold'). The hot nodule (right pair) is a very avid nodule causing background thyroid suppression.
