# 608 Acute appendicitis

## Incidence
Most common surgical emergency (lifetime incidence = 6%). Can occur at any age, though highest incidence is between 10-20yrs.⁸ It is rare before age 2 because the appendix is cone shaped with a larger lumen.

## Pathogenesis
Gut organisms invade the appendix wall after lumen obstruction by lymphoid hyperplasia, faecolith, or filarial worms. This leads to oedema, ischaemic necrosis, and perforation.

## Presentation
Classically periumbilical pain that moves to the RIF. Associated signs may include tachycardia, fever, peritonism with guarding and rebound or percussion tenderness in RIF. Pain on right during PR examination suggests an inflamed, low-lying pelvic appendix. Anorexia is an important feature; vomiting is rarely prominent—pain normally precedes vomiting in the surgical abdomen. Constipation is usual, though diarrhoea may occur. Additional signs: Rovsing's sign (pain > in RIF than LIF when the LIF is pressed). Psoas sign (pain on extending hip if retrocaecal appendix). Cope sign (pain on flexion and internal rotation of right hip if appendix in close relation to obturator internus).

## Investigations
Blood tests may reveal neutrophil leucocytosis and elevated CRP. US may help, but the appendix is not always visualized. CT has high diagnostic accuracy and is useful if diagnosis is unclear: it reduces -ve appendicectomy rate.

## Variations in the clinical picture
- Inflammation in a retrocecal/retroperitoneal appendix (2.5%) may cause flank or RUQ pain; its only sign may be tenderness on the right on PR.
- The child with vague abdominal pain who will not eat their favourite food.
- The shocked, confused octogenarian who is not in pain.
- Appendicitis occurs in ~1/1000 pregnancies. Mortality is higher, especially from 20wks' gestation. Perforation is more common, and increases fetal mortality. Pain is often less well localized (may be RUQ) and signs of peritonism less obvious.

## Hints
- If a child is anxious, use their hand to press their tummy.
- Check for recent viral illnesses and lymphadenopathy—mesenteric adenitis?
- Don't start palpating in the RIF (makes it difficult to elicit pain elsewhere).
- Expect diagnosis to be wrong half the time. If diagnosis is uncertain, re-examine often. A normal appendix is removed in up to 20% of patients.

## Treatment
Prompt appendicectomy (fig 13.27). Antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h, 1 to 3 doses IV starting 1h pre-op, reduces wound infections. Give a longer course if perforated. Laparoscopy: Has diagnostic and therapeutic advantages (if surgeon experienced), especially in women and the obese. It is not recommended in cases of suspected gangrenous perforation as the rate of abscess formation may be higher.

## Complications
- Perforation is commoner if a faecolith is present and in young children, as the diagnosis is more often delayed.
- Appendix mass may result when an inflamed appendix becomes covered with omentum. US/CT may help with diagnosis. Some advocate early surgery. Alternatively, initial conservative management—NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some perform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (laparotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th decade.
- Appendix abscess May result if an appendix mass fails to resolve but enlarges and the patient gets more unwell. Treatment usually involves drainage (surgical or percutaneous under US/CT-guidance). Antibiotics alone may bring resolution.

⁸ There is a second peak between 60-70yrs; older adults may present later with atypical symptoms.
