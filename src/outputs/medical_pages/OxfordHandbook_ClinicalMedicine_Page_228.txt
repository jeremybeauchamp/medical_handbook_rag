# Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia Commonest endocrine emergency—see p834. Prompt diagnosis and treatment essential—brain damage & death can occur if severe or prolonged.

**Definition** Plasma glucose ≤3mmol/L. Threshold for symptoms varies. See BOX.

**Symptoms** 
- Autonomic: Sweating, anxiety, hunger, tremor, palpitations, dizziness.
- Neuroglycopenic: Confusion, drowsiness, visual trouble, seizures, coma. Rarely focal symptoms, eg transient hemiplegia. Mutism, personality change, restlessness, and incoherence may lead to misdiagnosis of alcohol intoxication or even psychosis.

**Fasting hypoglycaemia Causes:** The chief cause is insulin or sulfonylurea treatment in a diabetic, eg ↑activity, missed meal, accidental or non-accidental overdose (check for ciculating oral hypoglycaemics). In non-diabetics you must EXPLAIN mechanism:
- Exogenous drugs, eg insulin, oral hypoglycaemics (p208)? access through diabetic in the family? Body-builders may misuse insulin to help stamina. Also: alcohol, eg a binge with no food; aspirin poisoning; ACE-i; β-blockers; pentamidine; quinine sulfate; aminoglutethamide; insulin-like growth factor.¹⁴
- Pituitary insufficiency.
- Liver failure, plus some rare inherited enzyme defects.
- Addison's disease.
- Islet cell tumours (insulinoma) and immune hypoglycaemia (eg anti-insulin receptor antibodies in Hodgkin's disease).
- Non-pancreatic neoplasms, eg fibrosarcomas and haemangiopericytomas.

**When to investigate:**
- Whipple answered this (Whipple's triad): symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia + ↓plasma glucose + resolution of symptoms or signs post glucose rise.
- Document BM during attack and lab glucose if in hospital (monitors often not reliable at low readings).
- Take a drug history and exclude liver failure.
- 72h fasting may be needed (monitor closely). Bloods: glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and plasma ketones if symptomatic. If endogenous hyperinsulinism suspected, do insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, β-hydroxybutyrate.

**Interpreting results:**
- Hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (HH): Causes: insulinoma, sulfonylureas, insulin injection (no detectable C-peptide—only released with endogenous insulin); non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome, mutation in the insulin-receptor gene. Congenital HH follows mutations in genes involved in insulin secretion (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, CGK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, ABCC8, & KCNJ11).¹⁵
- ↓Insulin low or undetectable, no excess ketones. Causes: non-pancreatic neoplasm; anti-insulin receptor antibodies.
- ↓Insulin, ↑ketones. Causes: alcohol, pituitary insufficiency, Addison's disease.

**Post-prandial hypoglycaemia** May occur after gastric/bariatric surgery ('dumping', p623), and in type 2 DM. Investigation: Prolonged OGTT (5h, p206).

**Treatment** See p834. If episodes are often, advise many small high-starch meals. If post-prandial ↑glucose, give slowly absorbed carbohydrate (high fibre). In diabetics, rationalize insulin therapy (p209).

## The definition of hypoglycaemia is context-dependent

The brain stops working if plasma glucose levels get too low, so we are nervous of levels ≤3mmol/L. But some are asymptomatic at this level. So what is definitely abnormal? The answer may be 4mmol/L, allowing for inaccuracies in fingerprick BMs (NB: whole blood glucose is 10-15% < plasma glucose.) Think: 'In this ill patient when can I be sure that a low glucose is not contributing to their illness?'

If <4mmol/L, you may be wise to treat (p834)—just in case. Consider, is the patient on hypoglycaemics, have they binged on alcohol 24hrs pre test? Skipped meals? Is there an underlying illness, eg insulinoma? Unlikely, but possible. Keep an open mind; let the GP know. Counsel patient and relative about warning signs of hypoglycaemia. Be more inclined to investigate if the effects of even mild hypoglycaemia might be disastrous (eg in pilots) or if there are unexplained symptoms.
