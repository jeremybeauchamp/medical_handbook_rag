## 6 Front of chest

- Apex beat.
- Expansion: Ask patient to 'breathe all the way out', place hands as in fig 2.19, 'now a deep breath in', and note distance of thumbs to midline, is expansion equal? Repeat with hands laid on upper chest.
- Tactile vocal fremitus: Palpate the chest wall with your fingertips and ask the patient to repeat '99', each time they feel your hand, comparing right to left. This is rarely used.
- Percussion: Percuss over different respiratory segments, comparing right and left (see fig 2.21, p53).
- Auscultation: Ask patient to 'take steady breaths in and out through your mouth' and listen with diaphragm from apices to bases, comparing right and left (see table 2.8, p52).
- Vocal resonance: Repeat auscultation, asking patient to repeat '99' each time they feel the stethoscope. If marked resonance heard, repeat with asking patient to whisper '99'; if clearly heard this is termed 'whispering pectoriloquy' and is a sensitive sign for consolidation. Outside of exams, the choice of vocal resonance or tactile vocal fremitus is a personal preference. Many clinicians prefer vocal resonance as it provides more information than tactile vocal fremitus.

## 8 To complete the examination

- Palpate for sacral and ankle oedema (fig 2.20)
- Check peripheral pulses, observation chart for temperature and O2 sats
- Examine the sputum pot and check PEFR

### Top tips

- Whispering pectoriloquy is a classic and specific sign of consolidation.
- If you don't adequately expose the chest you may miss small scars, eg from video thoracoscopy.
- If you see Horner's syndrome, check for wasting of the small muscles of the hand: see p702 and p708.
