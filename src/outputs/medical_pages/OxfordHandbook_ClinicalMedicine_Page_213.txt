AP chest radiograph showing air-space shadowing in the left upper zone

Fig 4.19 AP chest radiograph showing air-space shadowing in the left upper zone. Although this appearance often represents infection, it is non-specific. Differential diagnosis for this distribution of shadowing include lymphoma, alveolar cell carcinoma (both to be considered if not resolving in appearance on follow-up imaging), and haemorrhage.
