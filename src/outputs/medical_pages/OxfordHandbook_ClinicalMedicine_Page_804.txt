# 790 Shock

Circulatory failure resulting in inadequate organ perfusion. Often defined by BP—systolic <90mmHg—or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65mmHg—with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion, eg mottled skin, urine output (UO) of <0.5mL/kg/h, serum lactate >2mmol/L. Signs: ↓GCS/agitation, pallor, cool peripheries, tachycardia, slow capillary refill, tachypnoea, oliguria.

MAP = cardiac output (CO) × systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
CO = stroke volume × heart rate.
∴ shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both.

## Inadequate cardiac output
- **Hypovolaemia:**
  - Bleeding: trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, GI bleed.
  - Fluid loss: vomiting, burns, 'third-space' losses, eg pancreatitis, heat exhaustion.
- **Pump failure:**
  - Cardiogenic shock, eg ACS, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, acute valve failure.
  - Secondary causes, eg PE, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade.

## Peripheral circulatory failure (loss of SVR)
- **Sepsis:** (p792) Infection with any organism can cause acute vasodilation from inflammatory cytokines. Gram -ves can produce endotoxin, causing sudden and severe shock but without signs of infection (fever, ↑WCC). Classically patients with sepsis are warm & vasodilated, but may be cold & shut down. Other diseases, eg pancreatitis, can give a similar picture associated with the inflammatory cascade.
- **Anaphylaxis:** p794.
- **Neurogenic:** Eg spinal cord injury, epidural or spinal anaesthesia.
- **Endocrine failure:** Addison's disease, p836 or hypothyroidism; see p834.
- **Other:** Drugs, eg anaesthetics, antihypertensives, cyanide poisoning.

## Assessment
**ABCDE (p779).** With shock we are dealing primarily with 'C' so get large-bore IV access ×2 and check ECG for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischaemia.

- **General review:** Cold and clammy suggests cardiogenic shock or fluid loss. Look for signs of anaemia or dehydration, eg skin turgor, postural hypotension? Warm and well perfused, with bounding pulse points to septic shock. Any features suggestive of anaphylaxis—history, urticaria, angioedema, wheeze?
- **CVS:** Usually tachycardic (unless on β-blocker, or in spinal shock—OHCS p757) and hypotensive. But in the young and fit, or pregnant women, the systolic BP may remain normal, although the pulse pressure will narrow, with up to 30% blood volume depletion. Difference between arms (>20mmHg)—aortic dissection (p655)?
- **JVP or central venous pressure:** If raised, cardiogenic shock likely.
- **Check abdomen:** Any signs of trauma, or aneurysm? Any evidence of GI bleed?

## Management
If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team.

- **Septic shock:** See p792.
- **Anaphylaxis:** See p794.
- **Cardiogenic shock:** See p802.
- **Hypovolaemic shock:** Identify and treat underlying cause. Raise the legs.
  - Give fluid bolus 10–15mL/kg crystalloid via large peripheral line, if shock improves, repeat, titrate to HR (aim <100), BP (aim SBP >90) and UO (aim >0.5mL/kg/h).
  - If no improvement after 2 boluses, consider referral to ICU.
- **Haemorrhagic shock:** Stop bleeding if possible. See table 19.2 for grading.
  - If still shocked despite 2L crystalloid or present with class III/IV shock then crossmatch blood (request O Rh-ve in an emergency, see p348).
  - Give FFP with red cells (1:1 ratio); aim for platelets >100 and fibrinogen >1 (guided by results, but eg 1 pool of platelets and 2 pools of cryoprecipitate per 6-8 units of red cells). Consider tranexamic acid 2g IV. Discuss with haematology early.
- **Heat exposure (heat exhaustion):**
  - Tepid sponging + fanning; avoid ice and immersion. Resuscitate with IVI, eg 0.9% saline ± hydrocortisone 100mg IV. Lorazepam 1-2mg IV or chlorpromazine 25mg IM/IV may be used to stop shivering. Stop cooling when core temperature <39°C.
