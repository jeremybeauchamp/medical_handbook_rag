# Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

RA is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease, characterized by a symmetrical, de-forming, peripheral polyarthritis. It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 2-3 fold. 

## Epidemiology 
Prevalence is ~1% (↑ in smokers). ♀:♂ >2:1. Peak onset: 5th-6th decade. HLA DR4/DR1 linked (associated with severity).

## Presentation 
Typically: Symmetrical swollen, painful, and stiff small joints of hands and feet, worse in the morning. This can fluctuate and larger joints may become involved. 

Less common presentations:
- Sudden onset, widespread arthritis. 
- Recurring mono/polyarthritis of various joints (palindromic RA).²
- Persistent monoarthritis (knee, shoulder, or hip). 
- Systemic illness with extra-articular symptoms, eg fatigue, fever, weight loss, pericarditis, and pleurisy, but initially few joint problems (commoner in ♂). 
- Polymyalgic onset—vague limb girdle aches. 
- Recurrent soft tissue problems (eg frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain's tenosynovitis).

### Signs 
Early: (Inflammation, no joint damage.) Swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints (often symmetrical). Look for tenosynovitis or bursitis. 

Later: (Joint damage, deformity.) Ulnar deviation and subluxation of the wrist and fingers. Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities of fingers (fig 12.2 on p540) or Z-deformity of thumbs occur. Hand extensor tendons may rupture. Foot changes are similar. Larger joints can be involved. Atlanto-axial joint subluxation may threaten the spinal cord (rare).

## Extra-articular manifestations 
Affect ~40% of RA patients. 
- Nodules: Elbows, lungs, cardiac, CNS, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis. 
- Lungs: Pleural disease, interstitial fibrosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia. 
- Cardiac: IHD, pericarditis, pericardial effusion; carpal tunnel syndrome; peripheral neuropathy; splenomegaly (seen in 5%; only 1% have Felty's syndrome: RA + splenomegaly + neutropenia, see p698). 
- Eye: Episcleritis, scleritis, scleromalacia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (p560); osteoporosis; amyloidosis is rare (p370).¹⁷,¹⁸

## Investigations 
Rheumatoid factor (RhF) is positive in ~70% (p553). High titres associated with severe disease, erosions, and extra-articular disease. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are highly specific (~98%) for RA with a reasonable sensitivity (70-80%); they may also predict disease progression.¹⁹ Anaemia of chronic disease, ↑platelets, ↑ESR, ↑CRP. X-rays show soft tissue swelling, juxta-articular osteopenia and ↓joint space. Later there may be bony erosions, subluxation, or complete carpal destruction (see fig 12.5 on p541). Ultrasound and MRI can identify synovitis more accurately, and have greater sensitivity in detecting bone erosions than conventional X-rays.²⁰

## Diagnostic criteria 
See table 12.4.

## Management 
- Refer early to a rheumatologist (before irreversible destruction).
- Disease activity is measured using the DAS28.³ Treatment should be escalated until satisfactory control is achieved: 'treat to target'.
- Early use of DMARDS and biological agents improves long-term outcomes (see BOX 'Influencing biological events in RA').
- Steroids rapidly reduce symptoms and inflammation. Avoid starting unless appropriately experienced. Useful for acute exacerbations, eg IM depot methylprednisolone 80-120mg. Intra-articular steroids have a rapid but short-term effect (OHCS pp706-9). Oral steroids (eg prednisolone 7.5mg/d) may control difficult symptoms, but side effects preclude routine long-term use.
- NSAIDS (see p545) are good for symptom relief, but have no effect on disease progression. Paracetamol and weak opiates are rarely effective.
- Offer specialist physio- and occupational therapy, eg for aids and splints.
- Surgery may relieve pain, improve function, and prevent deformity.
- There is ↑risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, as atherosclerosis is accelerated in RA.²¹ Manage risk factors (p93). Smoking also ↑ symptoms of RA.

² In rheumatological palindromes, arthritis lasting hours or days runs to and fro, visiting and revisiting three or more sites, typically knees, wrists, and MCP joints. It may presage RA, SLE, Whipple's, or Behçet's disease. Remissions are (initially) complete, leaving no radiological mark.
