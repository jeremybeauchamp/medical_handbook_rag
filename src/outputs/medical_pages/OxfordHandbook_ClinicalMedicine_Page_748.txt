# Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

1. A large proportion of the human body is fat or water (~80%).
2. Fat and water contain a large number of hydrogen nuclei (unpaired protons).
3. The spin of a positively charged hydrogen nucleus gives it magnetic polarity.

Thus...
- Placing the human body in a magnetic field aligns its hydrogen nuclei either with (parallel) or against (anti-parallel) the field.
- A radiofrequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency flips a few nuclei away from their original alignment by an angle depending on the amount of energy they absorb.
- When the RF pulse stops, the nuclei flip back (or relax) into their original alignment, emitting the energy (called an echo) that was absorbed from the RF pulse.
- Measuring and plotting the energy of the returning signal according to location (provided the nuclei haven't moved) gives a picture of fat, tissue, and water as distributed throughout the body.
- The hydrogen nuclei in flowing blood move after receiving the RF pulses. The echo is not detected, and so the vessel lumen appears black (flow void).

Rather than radiodensity or attenuation, the correct descriptive terminology for the greyscale seen in MRI is signal intensity: high signal appears white and low signal black (see table 16.4). Weighting is a quality of MRI that is dependent on the time between the RF pulses (repetition time, TR) and the time between an RF pulse and the echo (echo time, TE). MR images are most commonly T1-weighted (good for visualizing anatomy) or T2-weighted (good for visualizing disease) but can also be a mixture of both, called proton density (PD) weighting. FLAIR sequences produce heavily T2-weighted images. A good way to determine the weighting of an MR image is to look for waterâ€”eg in the aqueous humour of the eye, CSF, or synovial fluid (see table 16.4; fig 16.17).

## Advantages 
MRI's great bonus is that it does not involve ionizing radiation. It has no known long-term adverse effects. It is excellent for imaging soft tissues (water- and hence proton-dense) and is preferred over CT for musculoskeletal disorders and for many intracranial, head, and neck pathologies (figs 16.18-16.20). Multiplanar acquisition of images can provide multiple views and 3D reconstruction from one scan. MR angiography is also excellent for reconstructing vascular anatomy. This avoids the need for invasive angiography with femoral puncture or CT contrast in patients with renal impairment.

## Disadvantages 
Long acquisition times. Poor imaging of lung parenchyma. Claustrophobic. Incompatible with some metal implants. High cost and specialized interpretation (=limited availability).

## Contraindications 
Absolute: 
- Pacemakers; other implanted electrical devices.
- Metallic foreign bodies, eg intra-ocular (consider orbital x-ray to exclude), shrapnel.
- Non-compatible surgical clips/coils/heart valves. 

Relative: 
- If unable to complete the pre-scan questionnaire. 
- Cochlear implants. 

NB: orthopaedic prostheses and extracranial metallic clips are generally safe. If uncertain, ask a radiologist. 

Contrast: 
- Renal impairment (gadolinium can cause systemic fibrosis). 
- Allergy. 
- Pregnancy.
