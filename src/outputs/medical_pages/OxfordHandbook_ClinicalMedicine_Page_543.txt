## Brain metastases
Affect up to ~40% of patients with cancer. Most commonly: lung, breast, colorectal, melanoma. Poor prognosis: median survival 1-2 months; better prognosis with single lesion, breast cancer (see also p830).

**Signs and symptoms:** Headache (~50%, often worse in the morning, when coughing or bending), focal neurological signs (~30%), ataxia (~21%), fits (~18%), nausea, vomiting, papilloedema.

**Management:** Urgent CT/MRI depending on underlying diagnosis, disease stage, and performance status. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h to reduce cerebral oedema. Stereotactic radiotherapy (see p527). Discuss with neurosurgery, especially if large lesion or associated hydrocephalus.

## Tumour lysis syndrome
Chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating tumours (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma) leads to cell death and ↑urate, ↑K+, ↑phosphate, ↓calcium. Risk of arrhythmia and renal failure (see p314).

**Management:** Prevent with hydration and uricolytics, eg rasburicase, allopurinol.

## Paraneoplastic syndromes
Paraneoplastic syndromes (table 11.3) consist of symptoms attributable to a malignancy mediated by hormones, cytokines, or the cross-reaction of tumour antibodies. They do not correlate with stage/prognosis and may pre-date other cancer symptoms.

### Table 11.3 Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes

| Paraneoplastic syndrome | Comment | Malignancies | See |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------|-----|
| Hypercalcaemia | Parathyroid hormone-related protein secreted by tumour | Lung, oesophagus, skin, cervix, breast, kidney | p528 |
| SIADH | Excessive antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion causing ↓Na+ | Lung, pancreas, lymphomas, prostate | p673 |
| Cushing's syndrome | Tumour secretes ACTH or CRF, causing adrenal to produce high levels of corticosteroid | Lung, pancreas, thymus, carcinoid | p224 |
| Neuropathy | Antibody-mediated neuronal degeneration: peripheral, autonomic, cerebellar | Lung, breast, myeloma, Hodgkin's, GI | p504 |
| Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome | Antibody to voltage-gated ion channel on pre-synaptic membrane causes weakness (proximal leg most common) | Mostly lung. Also GI, breast, thymus | p512 |
| Dermatomyositis & polymyositis | Inflammation of the muscles +/- heliotrope rash | Lung, breast, ovary, GI | p552 |
| Acanthosis nigricans | Velvety, hyperpigmented skin (usually flexural) | GI | p562 |
| Pemphigus | Blisters to skin/mucous membranes | Lymphoma, thymus, Kaposi's sarcoma | |
| Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy | Periosteal bone formation, arthritis, and finger clubbing | Lung | |

## Trousseau's sign

Trousseau (fig 11.5) was probably the first to discover a paraneoplastic syndrome. He noticed that many patients with migratory thrombophlebitis ('Trousseau's sign') developed gastric cancer. Unfortunately, he developed migratory thrombophlebitis himself and correctly predicted his own death from GI malignancy.
