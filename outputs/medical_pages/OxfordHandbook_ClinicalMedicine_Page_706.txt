# The porphyrias

The porphyrias are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases caused by various errors of haem biosynthesis (produced when iron is chelated into protoporphyrin IX), which may be genetic or acquired. Depending on the stage in haem biosynthesis that is faulty, there is accumulation of either porphyrinogens, which are unstable and oxidize to porphyrins, or their precursors, porphobilinogen and δ-aminolaevulinic acid. Porphyrin precursors are neurotoxic, while porphyrins themselves induce photosensitivity and the formation of toxic free radicals.

- Alcohol, lead, and iron deficiency cause abnormal porphyrin metabolism.
- Genetic counselling (OHCS p154) should be offered to all patients and their families.

## Acute porphyrias
Occur when the accumulation of porphyrinogen precursors predominates, and are characterized by acute neurovisceral crises, though some forms have additional photosensitive cutaneous manifestations.

**Acute intermittent porphyria:** ('The Madness of King George.') A low-penetrant autosomal dominant condition (porphobilinogen deaminase gene); 28% have no family history (de novo mutations). ~10% of those with the defective gene have neurovisceral symptoms. Attacks are intermittent, more common in women and those aged 18-40, and may be precipitated by drugs. Urine porphobilinogens are raised during attacks (the urine may go deep red on standing) and also, in ~50%, between attacks. Faecal porphyrin levels are normal. There is never cutaneous photosensitivity. It is the commonest form of porphyria—prevalence in UK: 1-2/100 000.

**Variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria:** Autosomal dominant, characterized by photosensitive blistering skin lesions and/or acute attacks. The former is prevalent in Afrikaners in South Africa. Porphobilinogen is high only during an attack, and other metabolites may be detected in faeces.

**Triggers of an acute attack:** Include infection, starvation (including pre-operative 'nil-by-mouth'), reproductive hormones (pregnancy, premenstrual), smoking, anaesthesia, and cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (alcohol, and other drugs—see BOX).

**Features of an acute attack:**
- Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation.
- Neuropsychiatric: peripheral neuropathy (weakness, hypotonia, pain, numbness), seizures (often associated with severe ↓Na⁺), psychosis (or other odd behaviour).
- Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, shock (due to sympathetic overactivity).
- Other: fever, ↓Na⁺, ↓K⁺, proteinuria, urinary porphobilinogens, discoloured urine.
  Rare but serious complications include bulbar and respiratory paralysis.

> Beware the 'acute abdomen' in acute intermittent porphyria: colic, vomiting, fever, and ↑WCC—so mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Anaesthesia could be disastrous.

**Treatment of an acute attack:**
- Remove precipitants (review medications; treat intercurrent illness/infection).
- IV fluids to correct electrolyte imbalance.
- High carbohydrate intake (eg Hycal®) by NG tube, or IV if necessary.
- IV haematin is 1st-line (inhibits production of porphyrinogen precursors).
- Nausea controlled with prochlorperazine 12.5mg IM.
- Sedate if necessary with chlorpromazine 50-100mg PO/IM.
- Pain control with opiate or opioid analgesia (avoid oxycodone).
- Seizures can be controlled with diazepam (although this will prolong the attack).
- Treat tachycardia and hypertension with a β-blocker.

## Non-acute porphyrias
**Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)**, **erythropoietic protoporphyria**, and **congenital erythropoietic porphyria** are characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity alone, as there is no overproduction of porphyrinogen precursors, only porphyrins. PCT presents in adults with blistering skin lesions ± facial hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation. Total plasma porphyrins and LFTs are ↑. Screen for associated disorders: hep C, HIV, iron overload, hepatocellular ca. ℞: phlebotomy, iron chelators, chloroquine, sunscreens.
