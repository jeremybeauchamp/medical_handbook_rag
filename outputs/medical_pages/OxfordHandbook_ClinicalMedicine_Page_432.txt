# Malaria: treatment

## Falciparum malaria

Risk of deterioration ∴ admit to hospital. Treatment depends upon whether the disease is uncomplicated, or severe. Features of severe disease are:

- Impaired consciousness/seizures (consider LP)
- AKI (oliguria <0.4mL/kg/h, creatinine>265μmol/L)
- Shock (BP <90/60) = 'Algid malaria'
- Hypoglycaemia (<2.2mmol/L)
- Pulmonary oedema/ARDS
- Hb <80g/L
- Spontaneous bleeding/DIC
- Acidosis (pH <7.3)
- Haemoglobinuria
- Parasitaemia >10%.

Remember other poor prognostic indicators: peripheral blood schizonts (see p417), elevated serum lactate, †age.

### Uncomplicated falciparum malaria:

Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) achieve rapid clearance of parasites by combined action at different stages of the parasite cycle (p417):

1. Artemether-lumefantrine: 4 tablets at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60h.
   1st line in UK (including pregnant >13wks), take with high-fat food to ↑ absorption.
2. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine: 4 tablets OD for 3d (if weight >60kg).
   Take >3h before and after food to prevent excessive peak levels. Possible ↑QT∴ avoid in arrhythmia.

Options if ACT not available:
- Atovaquone-proguanil: 4 tablets OD for 3 days. Parasite clearance ~66% after 3d, GI side-effects in ~25%.
- Oral quinine sulphate 600mg TDS for 5-7d plus doxycycline 200mg OD (or clindamycin 450mg TDS if pregnant) for 7d. Parasite monitoring required. Can cause 'cinchonism': nausea, deafness, ringing in ears.

- Resistance to ACT is emerging in Asia.
- Failure rates with antifolate drugs mean Fansidar® is no longer used.
- Chloroquine is not used in the treatment of falciparum malaria.

## Severe P. falciparum malaria

Give urgent parenteral treatment. Artesunate is treatment of choice. Meta-analysis shows reduction in mortality of 39% (CI: 25-50%) compared to quinine, preventing 94 deaths for every 1000 adults treated. IV artesunate is stocked by many infectious disease units in the UK. It can be obtained from tropical disease centres in London (020 3456 7890) and Liverpool (0151 706 2000).

Artesunate regimen (adult): 2.4mg/kg IV at 0h, 12h, 24h and then daily for up to 5d. Converted to a full course of ACT (see uncomplicated falciparum earlier in topic) when able to tolerate oral medication. Side-effects: delayed haemolysis 7-21d post-treatment (usually self-limiting)—check Hb 14d post treatment.

If artesunate is not available immediately, treatment should be started with quinine. It is safe to overlap/combine with artensunate when it is available.

Quinine regimen (adult): Loading dose 20mg/kg over 4h. Then 10mg/kg every 8h for next 48h or until patient can swallow (dose every 12h if patient has renal failure or hepatic dysfunction or if IV needed >48h). Convert to 600mg PO TDS to total quinine course 5-7d. Give with 7d oral doxycycline (clarithromycin in children/pregnant). Side-effects: cinchonism (see earlier in topic), hyperinsulinaemia.

Manage in a high dependency setting. ↑Capillary permeability so vulnerable to pulmonary oedema if over-filled. Lactate levels may reflect intravascular obstruction rather than circulating hypovolaemia. Monitor: blood glucose every 4h (2h if quinine infusion), Hb, clotting, electrolytes, creatinine. Daily parasite counts are sufficient NB: will fluctuate with the life cycle of the parasite (see p417) and an increase in first 36h of treatment may not indicate treatment failure. Given the rapid action of artesunate, exchange transfusion is no longer considered to offer any additional benefit.

Pregnancy: Little evidence on use/safety of artesunate. On balance of risk (pregnancy loss, pulmonary oedema, maternal mortality), artesunate should be given.
