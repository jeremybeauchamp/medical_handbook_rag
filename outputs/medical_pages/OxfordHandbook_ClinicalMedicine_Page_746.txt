732 CT images of two patients with acute abdominal pain

The image shows a CT scan of an abdominal cross-section. The scan reveals a large, bright circular area in the center, which is likely the aorta.

Fig 16.15 The history was of central abdominal pain with a non-peritonitic abdomen. The CT shows a leaking AAA. Under fluoroscopic screening, this can be repaired using stents, inserted via femoral arterial puncture and deployed in the aneurysm (p654). This kind of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is commonly used in the treatment of leaking AAA as well as elective repair of intact but enlarging aneurysms.

## The changing roles of surgeons and CT in the acutely unwell

In the days when general surgeons did their rounds towards the end of an on-call day, there would be wards of patients with undiagnosed abdominal pain having 'drip-and-suck' regimens (IVI and NGT) while awaiting improvement or a change in their clinical condition that revealed the need for surgery. On opening up, the surgeon would try to deal with whatever pathology was found. With increased subspecialization and accurate emergency imaging (CT and US), patients are now matched to a team best equipped to deal with their condition. In this context, drip-and-suck is on the ebb, giving way to imaging, early intervention, rapid discharge, or onward referral. With increasing pressures to safeguard surgical beds for elective cases and on junior surgeons to polish their surgical logbooks in decreased training hours, can come attempts to deflect away from surgical teams the care of patients in whom imaging or clinical circumstances suggest no current requirement for an operation. But is this always appropriate? Do we expect on-call surgeons to be practitioners of medicine, assessing and managing patients with surgical pathology, even if a trip to the operating theatre is not currently called for, or simply technicians restricted to cutting?
