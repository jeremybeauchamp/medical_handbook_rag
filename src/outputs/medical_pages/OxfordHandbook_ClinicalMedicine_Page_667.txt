The image shows a mostly blank white page with the following elements:

1. In the top right corner, there is the number "653" in black text.

2. Along the right edge of the page, there is a vertical red bar containing the word "Surgery" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. In the bottom right corner, there is a small red square icon containing a scissors symbol.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter title page for a section on Surgery in a larger document or textbook, with page number 653.
