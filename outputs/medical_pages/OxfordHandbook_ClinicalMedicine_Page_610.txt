# Skin diagnoses not to be missed

## Malignant tumours

### 1 Malignant melanoma: 
(See fig 13.16.) ♀:♂ ≈ 1.3:1. UK incidence: ≥10:100 000/yr (up ≥200% in last 20yrs). Commonly affects younger patients ∴ early diagnosis is vital. Short periods of intense UV exposure is a major cause, particularly in the early years. May occur in pre-existing moles. If smooth, well-demarcated, and regular, it is unlikely to be a melanoma but diagnosis can be tricky. Most melanomas have features described by Glasgow 7-point checklist (table 13.8) and ABCDE criteria (BOX), but not all.

> If in doubt, refer.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Major (2 pts each)   | Minor (1 pt each)                                                |

| • Change in shape    | • Sensory change                                                 |
| • Change in colour   | • Diameter >7mm (*unless growth is in the vertical plane)        |
| • Crusting or bleeding |                                                                |

Superficial spreading melanomas (70%) grow slowly, metastasize later, and have better prognosis than nodular melanomas (10-15%) which invade deeply and metastasize early. Nodular lesions may be amelanotic in ~5%. Others: acral melanomas occur on palms, soles, and subungual areas; lentigo maligna melanoma evolves from pre-existing lentigo maligna. Breslow thickness (depth in mm), tumour stage, and presence of ulceration are important prognostic factors. ℞: urgent excision can be curative. Chemotherapy gives a response in 10-30% with metastatic disease (OHCS p592). Ipilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an inhibitory T-cell receptor, has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.

### 2 Squamous cell cancer: 
Usually presents as an ulcerated lesion, with hard, raised edges, in sun-exposed sites. May begin in solar keratoses (see later in topic), or be found on the lips of smokers or in long-standing ulcers (=Marjolin's ulcer). Metastasis to lymph nodes is rare, local destruction may be extensive. ℞: excision + radiotherapy to treat recurrence/affected nodes. See fig 13.17. NB: the condition may be confused with a keratoacanthoma—a fast-growing, benign, self-limiting papule plugged with keratin.

### 3 Basal cell carcinoma: 
(AKA rodent ulcer) Nodular: typically a pearly nodule with rolled telangiectatic edge, on the face or a sun-exposed site. May have a central ulcer. See fig 13.18. Metastases are very rare. It slowly causes local destruction if left untreated. Superficial: lesions appear as red scaly plaques with a raised smooth edge, often on the trunk or shoulders. Cause: (most frequently) UV exposure. ℞: excision; cryotherapy; for superficial BCCs topical flurouracil or imiquimod (see as for 'Solar keratoses').

## Pre-malignant tumours

### 1 Solar (actinic) keratoses 
appear on sun-exposed skin as crumbly, yellow-white crusts. Malignant change to squamous cell carcinoma may occur after several years. Treatment: cryotherapy; 5% fluorouracil cream or 5% imiquimod—work by causing: erythema → vesiculation → erosion → ulceration → necrosis → healing epithelialization, leaving healthy skin unharmed. Warn patients of expected inflammatory reaction. See BNF for dosing. Alternatively: diclofenac gel (3%, use thinly twice-daily for ≤90d).

### 2 Bowen's disease: 
Slow-growing red/brown scaly plaque, eg on lower legs. Histology: full-thickness dysplasia (carcinoma in situ). It infrequently progresses to squamous cell cancer. Penile Bowen's disease is called Queyrat's erythroplasia. Treatment: cryotherapy, topical fluorouracil (see as for 'Solar keratoses') or photodynamic therapy.

## Others 
- **Secondary carcinoma:** Most common metastases to skin are from breast, kidney, or lung. Usually a firm nodule, most often on the scalp. See also acanthosis nigricans (p562). 
- **Mycosis fungoides:** Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma usually confined to skin. Causes itchy, red plaques (Sézary syndrome-variant also associated with erythroderma). 
- **Leucoplakia:** This appears as white patches (which may fissure) on oral or genital mucosa (where it may itch). Frank carcinomatous change may occur. 
- **Leprosy:** Suspect in any anaesthetic hypopigmented lesion (p441). 
- **Syphilis:** Any genital ulcer is syphilis until proved otherwise. Secondary syphilis: papular rash—including, unusually, on the palms (p412).
