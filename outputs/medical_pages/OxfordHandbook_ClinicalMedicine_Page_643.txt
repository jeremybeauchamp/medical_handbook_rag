# Rectal bleeding—an acute management plan

**Causes** Diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, haemorrhoids, IBD, perianal disease, angiodysplasia (submucosal arteriovenous malformations, typically elderly). Rarities: trauma, ischaemia colitis, radiation proctitis, aorto-enteric fistula.

**An acute management plan for this common surgical event:**

- ABC resuscitation, if necessary.
- History and examination.
- Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting, amylase (always thinking of pancreatitis), CRP, group and save—await Hb result before crossmatching unless unstable and bleeding.
- Imaging: May only need plain AXR, but if there are signs of perforation (eg sepsis, peritonism) or if there is cardiorespiratory comorbidity, then request an erect CXR.
- Fluid management: Insert 2 cannulae (≥18G) into the antecubital fossae. Insert a urinary catheter if there is a suspicion of haemodynamic compromise—there is no absolute indication, but remember that you are weighing up the risks and benefits. Give crystalloid as replacement and maintenance IVI. Blood transfusion only if significant blood loss (table 13.10, p607).
- Clotting: Withold ± reverse anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents (p351).
- Antibiotics may occasionally be required if there is evidence of sepsis or perforation, eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV.
- Keep bedbound: The patient may feel the need to get out of bed to pass stool, but this could be another large bleed, resulting in collapse if they try to walk. Don't allow them to mobilize and inform the nursing staff of this.
- Start a stool chart to monitor volume and frequency of motions. Send a sample for MC&S (x3 if known to have compromising comorbidity such as IBD).
- Diet: Keep on clear fluids so that they can have something, yet the colon will be as clear as possible if colonoscopy required.
- Interventions if bleeding not settling with conservative management: Angiography may allow localization of bleeding (eg sigmoid diverticulum or right sided angiodysplasia) as well as therapeutic embolization; CT angiography is a non-invasive alternative (without interventional options); colonoscopy may permit endoscopic haemostasis.
- Surgery: The main indication for this is unremitting, massive bleeding that is not controlled by other means.
