## Gait disorders

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Spastic | Stiff, circumduction of legs ± scuffing of the toe of the shoes: UMN lesions. |
| Extrapyramidal | Flexed posture, shuffling feet, slow to start, postural instability, eg Parkinson's disease. |
| Apraxic | Pathognomonic 'gluing-to-the-floor' on attempting walking or a wide-based unsteady gait with a tendency to fall, like a novice on an ice-rink. Seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus and multi-infarct states. |
| Ataxic | Wide-based; falls; cannot walk heel-to-toe. Caused by cerebellar lesions (eg MS, posterior fossa tumours, alcohol, phenytoin toxicity); proprioceptive sensory loss (eg sensory neuropathy, B12). Often worse in the dark or with eyes closed. |
| Myopathic | Waddling gait, cannot climb steps or stand from sitting due to hip girdle weakness. |
| Psychogenic | Suspect if there is a bizarre gait not conforming to any pattern of organic gait disturbance and without any signs when examined on the couch. |

**Tests** Spinal X-rays; MRI; FBC; ESR; syphilis serology; serum B12; U&E; LFT; PSA; serum electrophoresis; CXR; LP; EMG; muscle ± sural nerve biopsy.

## Non-neurological considerations in paralysed patients

Avoid pressure sores by turning and review weight-bearing areas often. Use appropriate pressure-relieving mattresses/cushions. Prevent thrombosis in paralysed limbs by frequent passive movement, pressure stockings, and LMWH (p350). Bladder care is vital; catheterization is only one option (do not control incontinence by decreasing fluid intake). Bowel evacuation may be manual or aided by suppositories; increasing dietary fibre intake may help. Exercise of unaffected or partially paralysed limbs is important to avoid unnecessary loss of function.
