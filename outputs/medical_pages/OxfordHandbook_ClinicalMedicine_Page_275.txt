# Causes of constipation

## General
- Poor diet ± lack of exercise
- Poor fluid intake/dehydration
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Old age
- Post-operative pain
- Hospital environment (↑privacy; having to use a bed pan).

## Anorectal disease (Esp. if painful.)
- Anal or colorectal cancer
- Fissures (p630), strictures, herpes
- Rectal prolapse
- Proctalgia fugax (p630)
- Mucosal ulceration/neoplasia
- Pelvic muscle dysfunction/levator ani syndrome.

## Intestinal obstruction
- Colorectal carcinoma (p616)
- Strictures (eg Crohn's disease)
- Pelvic mass (eg fetus, fibroids)
- Diverticulosis (rectal bleeding is a commoner presentation)
- Pseudo-obstruction (p611).

## Metabolic/endocrine
- Hypercalcaemia (p676)
- Hypothyroidism (rarely presents with constipation)
- Hypokalaemia (p674)
- Porphyria
- Lead poisoning.

## Drugs (Pre-empt by diet advice.)
- Opiates (eg morphine, codeine)
- Anticholinergics (eg tricyclics)
- Iron
- Some antacids, eg with aluminium
- Diuretics, eg furosemide
- Calcium channel blockers.

## Neuromuscular (Slow transit from decreased propulsive activity.)
- Spinal or pelvic nerve injury (eg trauma, surgery)
- Aganglionosis (Chagas' disease, Hirschsprung's disease)
- Systemic sclerosis
- Diabetic neuropathy.

## Other causes
- Chronic laxative abuse (rare—diarrhoea is commoner)
- Idiopathic slow transit
- Idiopathic megarectum/colon.

# Defining gastrointestinal dysfunction—the Rome criteria

> "Here was history in the stones of the street and the atoms of the sunshine... she went about in a kind of repressed ecstasy of contemplation, seeing often... a great deal more than was there."
> 
> Henry James, The Portrait of a Lady

While the tools of contemporary gastroenterology are well placed to explore the comparatively simple domains of structural lesions and inflammation, for those patients troubled by 'functional' disorders of motility and pain, we lack methods to understand nervous activity in their guts. Instead, unlike James' heroine Isabel Archer, as she explored late 19th-century Rome, we are left seeing a great deal less than perhaps is there. The failure to see, then becomes a failure to comprehend (the endoscopy and CT were normal, so there must be nothing wrong?)—then a failure to believe and ultimately to treat an illness.

Before we subject any intervention to the rigors of medical trials, we should first agree a classification of the disease process we are aiming to treat. Some of medicine's darkest alcoves reflect less a lack of potential treatments and more a lack of any agreement on where classification boundaries lie. Failure to define and distinguish pathologies then leads to a literature studded with small conflicting studies on heterogeneous patients which feeds a perception of a condition as 'untreatable'.

There is nothing romantic about constipation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in general, other than the association of the definitions of these disorders with Rome. By the late 1980s, these confused areas exemplified the above-described challenges. Recognition of the need for order and classification to support studies led to an international collaboration, born out of the University of Rome. A process of expert debate and discussion reached consensus definitions that could support scientific studies. The experts then periodically reconvene in the eternal city to revisit and evaluate these 'Rome consensus' definitions. Rather more prosaically, the Rome foundation itself is now headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
