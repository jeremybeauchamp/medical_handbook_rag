# Questions to address when confronted by a stone

## What is its composition? (See table 13.18.)

Table 13.18 Types, causes, and X-ray appearance of renal stones

| Type | Causative factors | Appearance on x-ray |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Calcium oxalate (fig 13.46) | Metabolic or idiopathic | Spiky, radio-opaque |
| Calcium phosphate | Metabolic or idiopathic | Smooth, may be large, radio-opaque |
| Magnesium ammonium phosphate (fig 13.47) | UTI (proteus causes alkaline urine and calcium precipitation and ammonium salt formation) | Large, horny, 'staghorn', radio-opaque |
| Urate (p680) | Hyperuricaemia | Smooth, brown, radiolucent |
| Cystine (fig 13.48) | Renal tubular defect | Yellow, crystalline, semi-opaque |

## Why has he or she got this stone now?
- Diet: chocolate, tea, rhubarb, strawberries, nuts, and spinach all ↑oxalate levels.
- Season: variations in calcium and oxalate levels are thought to be mediated by vitamin D synthesis via sunlight on skin.
- Work: can he/she drink freely at work? Is there dehydration?
- Medications: precipitating drugs include: diuretics, antacids, acetazolamide, corticosteroids, theophylline, aspirin, allopurinol, vitamin C and D, indinavir.

## Are there any predisposing factors? For example:
- Recurrent UTIs (in magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi).
- Metabolic abnormalities:
  - Hypercalciuria/hypercalcaemia (p676): hyperparathyroidism, neoplasia, sarcoidosis, hyperthyroidism, Addison's, Cushing's, lithium, vitamin D excess.
  - Hyperuricosuria/↑plasma urate: on its own, or with gout.
  - Hyperoxaluria.
  - Cystinuria (p321).
  - Renal tubular acidosis (pp316-7).
- Urinary tract abnormalities: eg pelviureteric junction obstruction, hydronephrosis (renal pelvis or calyces), calyceal diverticulum, horseshoe kidney, ureterocele, vesicoureteric reflux, ureteral stricture, medullary sponge kidney.¹¹
- Foreign bodies: eg stents, catheters.

## Is there a family history? 
Risk of stones 3-fold. Specific diseases include X-linked nephrolithiasis and Dent's disease (proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis).

## Is there infection above the stone? 
Eg fever, loin tender, pyuria? This needs urgent intervention.

¹¹ Medullary sponge kidney is a typically asymptomatic developmental anomaly of the kidney mostly seen in adult females, where there is dilatation of the collecting ducts, which if severe leads to a sponge-like appearance of the renal medulla. Complications/associations: UTIs, nephrolithiasis, haematuria and hypercalciuria, hyperparathyroidism (if present, look for genetic markers of MEN type 2A, see p223).
