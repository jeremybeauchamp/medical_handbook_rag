# Acknowledgements

Heart-felt thanks to our advisers on specific sectionsâ€”each is acknowledged on the chapter's first page. Thanks also to our junior readers, Charles Badu-Boateng, Clare Coggins, and Luke Walls. We especially thank all our mentors and teachers, and patients who provide our inspiration and remind us that one never stops learning. We acknowledge the Department of Radiology at both the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital for their kind help in providing many images, particularly Dr Edmund Godfrey, whose tireless hunt for perfect images has improved so many chapters.

## Readers' comments

These have formed a vital part of our endeavour to provide an accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date text. We sincerely thank the many students, doctors, and other health professionals who have found the time and the generosity to write to us on our Reader's Comments Cards, in editions past, or, in more recent times, via the web. These have now become so numerous for past editions that they cannot all be listed. See http://www.oup.com/uk/academic/series/oxhmed/links for a full list, and our very heart-felt tokens of thanks.
