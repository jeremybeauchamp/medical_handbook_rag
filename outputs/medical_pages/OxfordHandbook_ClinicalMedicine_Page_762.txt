# Contrast media in imaging

The use of a contrast medium can alter the electron density of two previously similar tissues, thus allowing them to be distinguished. Contrast medium is usually administered by the following routes:

- **PO**: Barium- or iodine-based agents for, eg swallow or enhancing visualization of bowel lumen on CT.
- **Inhaled**: Technetium or xenon used in ventilation scintigraphy.
- **IV**: (Most widespread clinical application.) Iodine or gadolinium.
- **PR**: Air or CO₂ can be introduced to the colon for CT colonography, iodinated contrast medium is used for water-soluble enemas.

## Iodine-based contrast agents
Iodine is used because of its relatively high electron density and good physiological tolerance. When used with CT, the examination is said to be contrast enhanced—look for '+ c' amongst the scan details.

*Exercise caution in*: renal or cardiac impairment; myeloma; diabetes; sickle cell disease; elderly; infants; the acutely unwell. ▶Avoid iodine-based agents in active hyperthyroidism.

▶Have renal function to hand in these patients (see p315). Minor reactions include nausea, vomiting, and a sensation of warmth. More severe reactions include urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, and low BP (1:250); theoretical risk of death for 1:150,000.

▶Metformin should be withheld for 48h after IV contrast administration because of the risk of lactic acidosis.

## Barium sulfate
Used in examination of the GI tract. Water-insoluble particles of 0.6–1.4μm diameter are mixed with large organic molecules such as pectin and gum to promote good flow, mucosal adherence, and high density in thin layers.
*Complications*: Chemical pneumonitis or peritonitis. Never administer if you suspect perforated viscus.

## Water-soluble, non-ionic, iodine-based contrast agents
Used instead of barium where there is a risk of peritoneal contamination (eg fistula, megacolon, ulceration, diverticulitis, bowel anastomosis, acute intestinal haemorrhage). Gastrograffin should not be used.

▶Contains iodine so establish allergy history and thyroid status.

## Air
In CT colonography, air (or CO₂) is insufflated as a negative contrast medium after barium administration to enhance mucosal definition. Water can also be used PO and PR to outline the lumen of the gut.

## Gadolinium
A lanthanide series element with paramagnetic qualities that is administered intravenously (as gadolinium-DTPA) to enhance the contrast of certain structures in MRI. It works by reducing the time to relaxation (TR) of hydrogen nuclei in its proximity and appears as high signal on T1-weighted scans. It does not cross the blood-brain barrier so is useful in enhancing isointense extra-axial tumours such as meningiomas. It can also highlight areas where the blood-brain barrier has broken down secondary to inflammatory or neoplastic processes. It is renally excreted: ▶check eGFR: if significantly reduced, gadolinium is contraindicated, as up to 30% may develop progressive nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy which causes generalized fibrosis which impairs movement and breathing—and which may be fatal. Aberrations in calcium-phosphate metabolism and erythropoietin treatment seem to increase risk. Other adverse reactions include headache, nausea, and local irritation at the site of injection, with idiosyncratic reaction reported in less than 1%.
