## Myeloma diagnosis

Have a high index of suspicion, eg in bone pain or back pain which is not improving. Check blood film and electrophoresis. Diagnostic criteria:

1. Monoclonal protein band in serum or urine electrophoresis.
2. Plasma cells on marrow biopsy.
3. Evidence of end-organ damage from myeloma:
   - Hypercalcaemia.
   - Renal insufficiency.
   - Anaemia.
4. Bone lesions: a skeletal survey after diagnosis detects bone disease: x-rays of chest; all of spine; skull; pelvis ± Tc-99m MIBI and PET (p739).

## Causes of bone pain/tenderness

- Trauma/fracture (steroids risk)
- Myeloma and other primary malignancy, eg plasmacytoma or sarcoma
- Secondaries (eg from breast, lung etc)
- Osteonecrosis, eg from microemboli
- Osteomyelitis/periostitis (eg syphilis)
- Hydatid cyst (bone is a rare site)
- Osteosclerosis, eg from hepatitis C
- Paget's disease of bone
- Sickle cell anaemia
- Renal osteodystrophy
- CREST syndrome/Sjögren's syndrome
- Hyperparathyroidism.

Tests: PSA, ESR, Ca²⁺, LFT, electrophoresis.
Treatment: Treat the cause; bisphosphonates & NSAIDs may control symptoms.

## Complications of myeloma

- Hypercalcaemia (p676). This occurs with active disease, eg at presentation or relapse. Rehydrate vigorously with IV saline 0.9% 4-6L/d (careful fluid balance). IV bisphosphonates, eg zolendronate or pamidronate, are useful for treating hypercalcaemia acutely.
- Spinal cord compression (p466). Occurs in 5% of those with myeloma. Urgent MRI if suspected. Treatment is with dexamethasone 8-16mg/24h PO and local radiotherapy.
- Hyperviscosity (p372) causes reduced cognition, disturbed vision, and bleeding. It is treated with plasmapheresis to remove light chains.
- Acute renal injury is treated with rehydration. Urgent dialysis may be needed.
