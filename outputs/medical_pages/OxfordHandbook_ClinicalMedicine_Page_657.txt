# Retroperitoneal fibrosis

## Causes
Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF), inflammatory aneurysms of the abdominal aorta, and perianeurysmal RPF. With idiopathic RPF there is an associated inflammatory response resulting in fibrinoid necrosis of the vasa vasorum, affecting the aorta and small and medium retroperitoneal vessels. The ureters get embedded in dense, fibrous tissue resulting in progressive bilateral ureteric obstruction. Secondary causes of RPF include malignancy, typically lymphoma.

## Associations
Drugs (eg β-blockers, bromocriptine, methysergide, methyldopa), autoimmune disease (eg thyroiditis, SLE, ANCA+ve vasculitis), smoking, asbestos.

## Typical patient
Middle-aged ♂ with vague loin, back, or abdominal pain, ↑BP.

## Tests
- **Blood:** ↑Urea and creatinine; ↑ESR; ↑CRP; anaemia.
- **Ultrasound:** Dilated ureters (hydronephrosis).
- **CT/MRI:** Periaortic mass (fig 13.50). Biopsy under imaging guidance is used to rule out malignancy.

## Treatment
Retrograde stent placement to relieve obstruction (removed after 12 months) ± ureterolysis (dissection of the ureters from the retroperitoneal tissue). Immunosuppression (in idiopathic RPF) with low-dose steroids has good long-term results.
