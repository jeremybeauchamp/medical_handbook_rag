# Immunosuppressive drugs

As well as being used in leukaemias and cancers, immunosuppression is required in organ and marrow transplants, and plays a role in the treatment of many diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, autoimmune hepatitis, asthma, SLE, vasculitis, and IBD, to name a few.

## Prednisolone
Steroids can be life-saving, but bear in mind:
- Long-term steroids (>3 weeks, or repeated courses) must not be stopped suddenly. Risk of Addisonian crisis due to adrenal insufficiency, see p836. Plan a gradual taper over weeks (with the advice of an endocrinologist if needed).
- Certain conditions may be made worse by steroids, eg TB, hypertension, chickenpox, osteoporosis, diabetes: here careful monitoring is needed.
- Growth retardation may occur in young patients, and the elderly frequently get more SE from treatment.
- Interactions: efficacy is reduced by anti-epileptics (see later in topic) and rifampicin.
- Caution in pregnancy (may cause fetal growth retardation). See BNF for use in breastfeeding.

### Side effects: 
Multiple and serious (see table 8.11): minimize these by using the lowest dose possible for the shortest period of time. Prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to reduce risk of osteoporosis (p682) or consider bisphosphonates. Before starting long-term treatment, explain clearly the potential SE to patients and ensure they are aware of the following:
- Do not stop steroids suddenly (p836).
- Consult a doctor if unwell; ↑steroid dose (eg if requiring antibiotics or surgery).
- Carry a steroid card stating dose taken, and the indication.
- Avoid over-the-counter drugs, eg NSAIDs: aspirin and ibuprofen (risk of DU).
- Exercise and smoking cessation help to prevent osteoporosis.

## Azathioprine
SE: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, marrow suppression (anaemia, lymphopenia), nephritis, pancreatitis, transaminitis. Interactions: Mercaptopurine and azathioprine (which is metabolized to mercaptopurine) are metabolized by xanthine oxidase (XO). So toxicity results if full dose azathioprine co-administered with XO inhibitors (eg allopurinol). Monitoring: Local guidelines should be in place to guide; typically weekly FBC, U&E, creatine, LFT during initiation then 1-3-monthly once stable.

## Ciclosporin, tacrolimus
Calcineurin inhibitors with important roles in reducing rejection in organ and marrow transplant. The main SE is dose-related nephrotoxicity: check blood levels.
- Other SE: gum hyperplasia (ciclosporin), tremor, ↑BP (stop if ↑↑), oedema, paraesthesiae, confusion, seizures, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma, skin cancer—avoid sunbathing.
- Monitor U&E and creatinine every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, then monthly if dose >2.5mg/kg/d (every 2 months if less than this). Reduce the dose if creatinine rises by >30% on two measurements even if the creatinine is still in normal range. Stop if the abnormality persists. Also monitor LFT.
- Interactions are legion: potentiated by: ketoconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, the Pill, erythromycin, grapefruit juice. Efficacy is reduced by: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin. Avoid concurrent nephrotoxics: eg gentamicin. Concurrent NSAIDs augment hepatotoxicity—monitor LFT.

## Methotrexate
An antimetabolite. Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. See p547.

## Cyclophosphamide
An alkylating agent. SE: marrow suppression (monitor FBC), nausea, infertility, teratogenic, haemorrhagic cystitis due to an irritative urinary metabolite. There is a slight ↑risk of later developing bladder cancer or leukaemia.
