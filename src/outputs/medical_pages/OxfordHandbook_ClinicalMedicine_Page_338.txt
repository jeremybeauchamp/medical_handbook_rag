# Anaemia

Anaemia is defined as a low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and may be due either to a low red cell mass or increased plasma volume (eg in pregnancy). A low Hb (at sea level) is <135g/L for men and <115g/L for women. Anaemia may be due to reduced production or increased loss of RBCs and has many causes. These will often be distinguishable by history, examination, and inspection of the blood film (fig 8.2, p323).

## Symptoms
Due to the underlying cause or to the anaemia itself: fatigue, dyspnoea, faintness, palpitations, headache, tinnitus, anorexia—and angina if there is pre-existing coronary artery disease.

## Signs
May be absent even in severe anaemia. There may be pallor (eg of the conjunctivae, see fig 8.3, although this is not a reliable sign). In severe anaemia (Hb <80g/L), there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation, eg tachycardia, flow murmurs (ejection-systolic loudest over apex), and cardiac enlargement; or retinal haemorrhages (rarely). Later, heart failure may occur: here, rapid blood transfusion can be fatal.

## Types of anaemia
The first step in diagnosis is to look at the mean cell volume (MCV). Normal MCV is 76-96 femtolitres (10^15 fL = 1L).

### Low MCV (microcytic anaemia):
1. Iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA), the most common cause: see p326.
2. Thalassaemia (suspect if the MCV is 'too low' for the Hb level and the red cell count is raised, though definitive diagnosis needs DNA analysis): see p342.
3. Sideroblastic anaemia (very rare): p326.

NB: there is iron accumulation in the last two conditions, and so tests will show increased serum iron and ferritin with a low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).

### Normal MCV (normocytic anaemia):
1. Acute blood loss.
2. Anaemia of chronic disease (or ↓MCV).
3. Bone marrow failure.
4. Renal failure.
5. Hypothyroidism (or ↑MCV).
6. Haemolysis (or ↑MCV).
7. Pregnancy.

NB: if ↓wcc or ↓platelet in normocytic anaemia, suspect marrow failure: see p364.

### High MCV (macrocytic anaemia):
1. B12 or folate deficiency.
2. Alcohol excess—or liver disease.
3. Reticulocytosis (p328, eg with haemolysis).
4. Cytotoxics, eg hydroxycarbamide.
5. Myelodysplastic syndromes.
6. Marrow infiltration.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Antifolate drugs (eg phenytoin).

### Haemolytic anaemias:
These do not fit into the above-mentioned classification as the anaemia may be normocytic or, if there are many young (hence larger) RBCs and reticulocytes, macrocytic (p332). Suspect if there is a reticulocytosis (>2% of RBCs; or reticulocyte count >100×10^9/L), mild macrocytosis, ↓haptoglobin, ↑bilirubin, ↑LDH, or ↑urobilinogen. These patients will often be mildly jaundiced (but note that haemolysis causes pre-hepatic jaundice so there will be no bilirubin in their urine).

## Does the patient need a blood transfusion?
Probably not if Hb >70g/L. Chronic anaemia in particular can be well-tolerated (though it is crucial to ascertain the cause), and in IDA iron supplements will raise the Hb more safely and cost-effectively. In acute anaemia (eg haemorrhage with active peptic ulcer), transfusion for those with Hb <70g/L may be indicated. Other factors to consider include comorbidities (particularly IHD) and whether the patient is symptomatic.

In severe anaemia with heart failure, transfusion is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60-80g/L, but this must be done with great care. Give it slowly with 10-40mg furosemide IV/PO with alternate units (dose depends on previous exposure to diuretics; do not mix with blood). Check for signs of worsening overload: rising JVP and basal crackles; in this eventuality, stop and treat.
