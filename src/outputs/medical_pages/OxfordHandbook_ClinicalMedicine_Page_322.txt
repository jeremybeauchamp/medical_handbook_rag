## Renal replacement therapy (RRT): transplantation

Transplantation (figs 7.8, 7.9) should be considered for every patient with, or progressing towards, stage G5 kidney disease (p302). It is the treatment of choice for kidney failure provided risks do not exceed benefits. Many will not make the transplant list due to comorbidity or frailty.

### Contraindications
- Absolute: cancer with metastases.
- Temporary: active infection, HIV with viral replication, unstable CVD.
- Relative: congestive heart failure, CVD.

### Types of graft
- Living donor: Best graft function and survival, especially if HLA matched.
- Deceased donor: (See organ donation p13.)
  1. Donor after brain death (DBD, heart-beating donor).
  2. Expanded criteria donor (ECD) is from an older kidney or from a patient with a history of CVA, BP, or CKD. This impacts on the long-term prognosis of the transplant but offers a better outcome than remaining on dialysis.
  3. Donor after cardiac death (DCD, non-heart-beating donor) with risk of delayed graft function.

### Immunosuppression
A combination of drugs are used. Aim is to use the minimal effective dose with the lowest drug-related toxicity. Protocol used depends upon the immunological risk of the recipient and type of donated kidney.

**Monoclonal antibodies:** Eg basiliximab, daclizumab (selectively block activated T cells via CD-25), alemtuzumab (T- and B-cell depletion). Used at the time of transplantation ('induction'). ↑Acute rejection and graft loss, ↑infection risk if non-selective.

**Calcineurin inhibitors:** Eg tacrolimus, ciclosporin. These drugs inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation. Inter-individual variation and narrow therapeutic index mean drug level monitoring is required. Clearance is dependent on cytochrome p450 isoenzymes so beware of drug interactions including macrolide antibiotics and antifungal drugs. Side effects: nephrotoxicity in the graft, modification of CV risk factors: ↑BP, ↑cholesterol, NODAT (new-onset diabetes after transplantation).

**Antimetabolites:** Eg mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine. MPA is now used preferentially due to better prevention of acute rejection and graft survival (not in pregnancy, MPA is teratogenic). Side effects: anaemia, leucopenia, and GI toxicity.

**Glucorticosteroids:** ↓Transcription of inflammatory cytokines. First-choice treatment for acute rejection. Significant side-effects (↑BP, hyperlipidaemia, DM, impaired wound healing, osteoporosis, cataracts, skin fragility) have led to protocols with early withdrawal of steroids and the use of steroid-free immunosuppression regimens.

### Complications
**Surgical:** Bleed, thrombosis, infection, urinary leaks, lymphocele, hernia.

**Delayed graft function:** Affects up to 40% of grafts, more common in DCD.

**Rejection:** Acute or chronic. Acute is divided into antibody mediated (rare unless known pre-sensitized recipient) or cellular (most common). Causes ↓renal function, diagnosed on graft biopsy. Treatment with high-dose steroids and ↑immunosuppression. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection causes progressive dysfunction of the graft. Most graft loss is now thought to be due to an immune response by donor-specific antibodies causing damage to the kidney microcirculation. Complex pathology and lack of controlled studies mean treatment is not clear. The results of monoclonal antibody trials are awaited.

**Infection:** Risk of all infections. Typically hospital acquired/donor derived in month 1, opportunistic in months 1-6 (therefore prophylactic treatment for CMV and Pneumocystis jirovecii given), usual spectrum of community-acquired infection after 6-12 months. Late viral infection should always be considered: eg CMV, HSV.

**Malignancy:** Up to 25× ↑risk of cancer with immunosuppression, particularly skin, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and gynaecological.

**CVD:** 3-5× ↑risk of premature CVD compared to general population (but ~80% less than dialysis). ↑BP, NODAT, rejection, and renal history (uraemic cardiomyopathy) contribute.
