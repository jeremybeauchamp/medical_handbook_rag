## Screening for unhealthy alcohol use

Several screening tools have been validated (eg AUDIT) but these typically require detailed questioning and careful scoring. For simplicity, a single-item question has much to recommend it, such as "How many times in the past year have you had five (four for ♀) or more drinks in a day?" (+ve if >0; 82% sensitive, 79% specific). This can be followed up with the easily remembered CAGE questions: Ever felt you ought to cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Ever felt guilty about your drinking? Ever had an eye-opener in the morning? Those answering 'yes' to ≥2 may be exhibiting dependency (sensitivity 43-94%; specificity 70-97%), but accuracy does change according to background population. Those who refuse, or give unconvincing answers may have more to tell in their biochemistry: look for γGT, ALT, MCV, AST:ALT>2, urea, ↓platelets.

## Managing alcoholic hepatitis

The patient: Malaise; ↑TPR; anorexia; D&V; tender hepatomegaly ± jaundice; bleeding; ascites. Blood: ↑WCC; ↓platelets (toxic effect or ∵ hypersplenism); ↑INR; ↑AST; ↑MCV; ↑urea. Jaundice, encephalopathy or coagulopathy ≈ severe hepatitis.

- Most need hospitalizing; urinary catheter and CVP monitoring may be needed.
- Screen for infections ± ascitic fluid tap and treat for SBP (p276).
- Stop alcohol consumption: for withdrawal symptoms, if chlordiazepoxide by the oral route is impossible, try lorazepam IM.
- Vitamins: vit K: 10mg/d IV for 3d. Thiamine 100mg/d PO (high-dose B vitamins can also be given IV as Pabrinex®—1 pair of ampoules in 50mL 0.9% saline IVI over ½h).
- Optimize nutrition (35–40kcal/kg/d non-protein energy). Use ideal body weight for calculations, eg if malnourished.
- Don't use low-protein diets even if severe encephalopathy is present. Give >1.2g/kg/d of protein; this prevents encephalopathy, sepsis, and some deaths.
- Daily weight; LFT; U&E; INR. If creatinine ↑, get help with this—HRS (p275). ↓Na+ is common, but water restriction may make matters worse.
- Steroids may confer benefit in those with severe disease. The Maddrey Discriminant Factor (DF) = (4.6 × patient's prothrombin time in sec – control time) + bilirubin (μmol/L) roughly reflects mortality. If Maddrey score >31 and encephalopathy then consider prednisolone 40mg/d for 5d tapered over 3wks. CI: sepsis; variceal bleeding. The largest study to date (STOPAH) showed only a non-significant trend towards benefit with this regimen.

Prognosis: Mild episodes hardly affect mortality; if severe, mortality ≈ 50% at 30d. 1yr after admission for alcoholic hepatitis, 40% are dead...a sobering thought.
