# DEXA bone densitometry: WHO osteoporosis criteria

It is better to scan the hip than the lumbar spine. Bone mineral density (g/cm²) is compared with that of a young healthy adult. The 'T-score' is the number of standard deviations (SD, p751) the bone mineral density (BMD) is from the youthful average. Each decrease of 1 SD in BMD ≈ 2.6-fold ↑ in risk of hip fracture.

## Table 14.5 Interpreting DEXA bone scan results

| T-score     | Interpretation                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| T-score >0  | BMD is better than the reference.                                                   |
| 0 to −1     | BMD is in the top 84%: no evidence of osteoporosis.                                 |
| −1 to −2.5  | Osteopenia. Risk of later osteoporotic fracture. Offer lifestyle advice.            |
| −2.5 or worse | Osteoporosis. Offer lifestyle advice and treatment (p682). Repeat DEXA in 2yrs.   |

## Some indications for DEXA:

- NICE suggests DEXA if previous low-trauma fracture, or for women ≥ 65yrs with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, or younger if two or more. The benefits of universal screening for osteoporosis remain unproven, but some authorities recommend this for men and women over 70—and earlier if risk factors are present.¹⁷
- DEXA is not needed pre-treatment for women over 75yrs if previous low-trauma fracture, or ≥ 2 present of rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol excess, or positive family history.
- Prior to giving long-term prednisolone (eg ≥3 months at >5mg/d). Steroids cause osteoporosis by promoting osteoclast bone resorption, ↓muscle mass, and ↓Ca²⁺ absorption from the gut.
- Men or women with osteopenia if low-trauma, non-vertebral fracture.
- Bone and bone-remodelling disorders (eg parathyroid disorders, myeloma, HIV, esp. if on protease inhibitors).

## Osteoporosis risk factors: 'SHATTERED'

- **S**teroid use of >5mg/d of prednisolone.
- **H**yperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hypercalciuria.
- **A**lcohol and tobacco use ↑.
- **T**hin (BMI <18.5).
- **T**estosterone ↓ (eg antiandrogen ca prostate Rx).
- **E**arly menopause.
- **R**enal or liver failure.
- **E**rosive/inflammatory bone disease (eg myeloma or rheumatoid arthritis).
- **D**ietary ↓Ca²⁺/malabsorption; diabetes mellitus type 1.
