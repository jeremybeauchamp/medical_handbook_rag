Anatomy of the thyroid gland region

Fig 13.21 The anatomy of the region of the thyroid gland. The important structures that must be considered when operating on the thyroid gland include:
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve
- Superior laryngeal nerve
- Parathyroid glands
- Trachea
- Common carotid artery
- Internal jugular vein (not depictedâ€”see fig 13.23).

The image shows both posterior and lateral views of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures. Key anatomical features labeled include:

- Superior laryngeal nerve
- Vagus nerve
- Left and right lobes of thyroid gland
- Superior thyroid artery
- Superior parathyroid glands
- Inferior thyroid artery
- Inferior parathyroid glands
- Recurrent laryngeal nerve

Uptake ratio is 6 : 1

Radionuclide study of the thyroid

Fig 13.22 Radionuclide study of the thyroid showing changes consistent with Graves' disease (see also hot and cold nodules (p216) and nuclear medicine, p738). There is increased uptake of the radionuclide trace diffusely throughout both lobes of the gland.

Transverse ultrasound of the left lobe of the thyroid

Fig 13.23 Transverse ultrasound of the left lobe of the thyroid showing a small low-reflectivity cyst within higher-reflectivity thyroid tissue. Note the proximity to the gland of the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein (the latter compressed slightly by pressure from the probe), both seen beneath the body of sternocleidomastoid muscle.
