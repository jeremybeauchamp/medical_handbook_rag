## Cluster headache

Cluster headache may be the most disabling of the primary headache disorders.
The cause (unknown ♂:♀ ≥5:1; onset at any age; commoner in smokers).

**Symptoms** Rapid-onset of excruciating pain around one eye that may become
watery and bloodshot with lid swelling, lacrimation, facial flushing, rhinorrhoea,
miosis ± ptosis (20% of attacks). Pain is strictly unilateral and almost always affects the same side. It lasts 15-180min, occurs once or twice a day, and is often
nocturnal. Clusters last 4-12wks and are followed by pain-free periods of months
or even 1-2yrs before the next cluster. Sometimes it is chronic, not episodic.

**Treatment** *Acute attack*: 'Keep calm ... carry oxygen': give 100% O₂ for ~15min via
non-rebreathable mask (not if COPD); sumatriptan SC 6mg at onset (or zolmitriptan
nasal spray 5mg).

**Preventives** *Avoid triggers*: Eg alcohol. *Medication*: Consider: corticosteroids
(short term only; many SE); verapamil 360mg, lithium 900mg (monitor carefully).

## Trigeminal neuralgia

**Symptoms**: Paroxysms of intense, stabbing pain, lasting seconds, in the trigeminal nerve distribution. It is unilateral, typically affecting mandibular or maxillary
divisions. The face screws up with pain (hence tic douloureux). *Triggers*: Washing affected area, shaving, eating, talking, dental prostheses. *Typical patient*: ♂
>50yrs old; in Asians ♀:♂ ≈ 2:1. *Secondary causes*: Compression of the trigeminal root by anomalous or aneurysmal intracranial vessels or a tumour, chronic
meningeal inflammation, MS, zoster, skull base malformation (eg Chiari). *MRI*: Is
necessary to exclude secondary causes (~14% of cases). ℞: Carbamazepine (start
at 100mg/12h PO; max 400mg/6h; lamotrigine; phenytoin 200–400mg/24h PO; or
gabapentin (p504). If drugs fail, surgery may be necessary. This may be directed
at the peripheral nerve, the trigeminal ganglion, or the nerve root. *Microvascular
decompression*: Anomalous vessels are separated from the trigeminal root. Stereotactic gamma knife surgery can work, but length of pain relief and the time to
treatment response are limiting factors. *Facial pain* ∆∆: p65.
