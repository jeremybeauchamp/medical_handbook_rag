## An unusual BP measurement

Don't interpret a BP value in isolation (p138). We cannot diagnose hypertension (or hypotension) on one BP reading. Take into account pain, the 'white coat' effect (BP higher in a medical setting), and equipment. Getting cuff size right is vital. *Optimal cuff width is 40% of the arm circumference*. If you suspect a BP reading to be anomalous, check the equipment and review the observation chart for previous readings and other vital signs. Consider taking a manual reading with a different set yourself.

Often a quiet chat will bring the BP down (yours and your patient's: keep your ears open, and the patient may reveal some new tangential but vital fact that the official history glossed over). Many things affect BP readings from background noise to how much you touch the patient. If BP, eg ≥150/90, check both arms. If the systolic difference is >20mmHg, consider peripheral vascular disease, and if the patient could have a thoracic aortic aneurysm or coarctation (rare). NB: right arm diastolic is normally 2.4-5mmHg higher than left.

## Postural hypotension

This is an important cause of falls and faints in the elderly. It is defined as a drop in systolic BP >20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg after standing for 3min vs lying.

**Causes:** Hypovolaemia (early sign); drugs, eg nitrates, diuretics, antihypertensives, antipsychotics; Addison's (p226); hypopituitarism (ACTH); autonomic neuropathy (p505, DM, multisystem atrophy, p494); after a marathon run (peripheral resistance is low for some hours); idiopathic.

**Treatment:**
- Lie down if feeling faint.
- Stand slowly (with escape route: don't move away from the chair too soon!).
- Consider referral to a 'falls clinic', where special equipment is available for monitoring patient under various tilts.
- Manage autonomic neuropathy, p505.
- Water and salt ingestion can help (eg 150mmol Na+/d), but Na+ has its problems.
- Physical measures: leg crossing, squatting, elastic compression stockings (check dorsalis pedis pulse is present), and careful exercise may help.
- If post-prandial dizziness, eat little and often; ↓carbohydrate and alcohol intake.
- Head-up tilt of the bed at night ↑renin release, so ↓fluid loss and ↑standing BP.
- 1st-line drugs: fludrocortisone (retains fluid) 50mcg/d; go up to 300mcg/24h PO only if tolerated. Monitor weight; beware if CCF, renal impairment, or ↓albumin as fludrocortisone worsens oedema.
- 2nd-line drugs: sympathomimetics, eg midodrine (not always available) or ephedrine; pyridostigmine (eg if detrusor under-activity too).
- If these fail, turn things on their head and ask: *is this really supine hypertension?*

## Hyperlipidaemia

Xanthomata are localized deposits of fat under the skin, occurring over joints, tendons, hands, and feet. *Xanthelasma* refers to xanthoma on the eyelid (p691, fig 14.13). *Corneal arcus* (fig 2.7, p39) is a crescentic-shaped opacity at the periphery of the cornea. Common in those over 60yrs, can be normal, but may represent hyperlipidaemia, especially in those under this age.

## Top tips

The hand can be used as a manometer to estimate JVP/CVP if you cannot see the neck properly (eg central line in situ). Hold the hand palm down below the level of the heart until the veins dilate (patient must be warm!), then lift slowly, keeping the arm horizontal. The veins should empty as the hand is raised. Empty veins below the level of the heart suggests a low CVP, if they remain full it suggests a normal/high CVP.
