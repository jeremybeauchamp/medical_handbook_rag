# Management plan for diabetic ketoacidosis

ABC approach, 2 large-bore cannulae:
Start fluid: 1L 0.9% saline over 1h (if systolic BP <90mmHg then give 500mL
bolus over 15mins and reassess—if systolic BP still <90mmHg then seek senior
review and give further 500mL bolus; if BP remains <90mmHg then involve ICU)

Tests: Venous blood gas for pH, bicarbonate; bedside and lab
glucose and ketones; U&Es, FBC, CRP; CXR, ECG

Insulin: Add 50 units human soluble insulin to 50mL 0.9% saline. Infuse con-
tinuously at 0.1 unit/kg/h. Continue patient's regular long-acting insulin at usual
doses and times; consider initiating long-acting insulin in newly diagnosed T1DM.
Aim for a fall in blood ketones of 0.5mmol/L/h, or a rise in venous bicarbo-
nate of 3mmol/L/h with a fall in glucose of 3mmol/L/h. If not achieving this,
increase insulin infusion by 1 unit/h until target rates achieved

Check capillary blood glucose and ketones hourly
Check VBG (pH, HCO3-, K+) at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h (or more frequent)

Continue fluids and assess need for K+ (see below)

Consider catheter if not passed urine by 1h, aim for urine output
0.5mL/kg/h. Consider NG tube if vomiting or drowsy
Start all patients on LMWH

Avoid hypoglycaemia! When glucose <14mmol/L start 10% glucose
at 125mL/h to run alongside saline and prevent hypoglycaemia

Continue fixed-rate insulin until ketones <0.6mmol/L, venous pH
>7.3, and venous bicarb >15mmol/L. Do not rely on urinary ketones to
indicate resolution—they stay positive after DKA resolved
Find and treat infection/cause for DKA

## Fluid replacement

- 0.9% saline is the replacement fluid of choice.
- Typical fluid deficit is 100mL/kg, so for an average 70kg man = 7 litres.
- Give eg 1L in 1h (faster if systolic BP <90mmHg) then: 1L over 2h, 1L over 2h, 1L
over 4h, 1L over 4h, 1L over 8h. This regimen may not be appropriate for all: reas-
sess frequently, especially if young, elderly, pregnant, or comorbidities.
- Bicarbonate may increase risk of cerebral oedema and is not recommended.

## Potassium replacement

- Typical deficit = 3-5mmol/kg, plasma K+ falls with treatment as K+ enters cells.
- Don't add K+ to the 1st bag. Thereafter add K+ according to most recent VBG
result (table 19.5).

Table 19.5 Potassium replacement in DKA

| Serum K+ (mmol/L) | Amount of KCl to add per litre of IV fluid |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| >5.5              | Nil                                       |
| 3.5-5.5           | 40mmol                                    |
| <3.5              | Seek help from HDU/ICU for higher doses   |
