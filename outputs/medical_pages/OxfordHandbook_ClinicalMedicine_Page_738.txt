# Chest x-ray—part 2: the lungs

The apex of the lower lobe rises up to the 4th rib posteriorly, so it is difficult to ascribe the true location of a lobe on a PA image without additional information from a lateral view. It may therefore be better to use the term 'zone' rather than lobe when localizing a lesion.

## Opacification
Lung opacities are described as nodular, reticular (network of fine lines, interstitial), or alveolar (fluffy). A single nodule may be called a space-occupying lesion (SOL).

### Nodules: (If >3cm across, the term pulmonary mass is used instead.)
- Neoplasia: metastases (often missed if small), lung cancer, hamartoma, adenoma.
- Infections: varicella pneumonia, septic emboli, abscess (eg as an SOL), hydatid.
- Granulomas: miliary TB, sarcoidosis (see GPA, p714), histoplasmosis.
- Pneumoconioses (except asbestosis), Caplan's syndrome (p696).

### Reticular opacification: =Lung parenchymal changes.
- Acute interstitial oedema.
- Infection: acute (viral, bacterial), chronic (TB, histoplasmosis).
- Fibrosis: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), drugs (eg methotrexate, bleomycin, crack cocaine), connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid arthritis—p546, GPA—p714, SLE, PAN, systemic sclerosis—p552, sarcoidosis), industrial lung diseases (silicosis, asbestosis).
- Malignancy (lymphangitis carcinomatosa).

### Alveolar opacification: = Airspace opacification, can be due to any material filling the alveoli:
- Pus—pneumonia.
- Blood—haemorrhage, DIC (p352).
- Water—heart, renal, or liver failure (p302, p274), ARDS (p186), smoke inhalation (p847), drugs (heroin), O₂ toxicity, near drowning (OHCS p768).
- Cells—lymphoma, adenocarcinoma.
- Protein—alveolar proteinosis, ARDS, fat emboli (~7d post fracture).

### 'Ring' opacities: 
Either airways seen end-on (bronchitis; bronchiectasis) or cavitating lesions, eg abscess (bacterial, fungal, amoebic), tumour, or pulmonary infarct (wedge-shaped with a pleural base).

### Linear opacities: 
Septal lines (Kerley B lines, ie interlobular lymphatics seen with fluid, tumour, or dusts); atelectasis; pleural plaques (asbestos exposure).

### White-out of whole hemithorax: 
(fig 16.4) Pneumonia, large pleural effusion, ARDS, post-pneumonectomy.

## Gas outside the lungs 
Check for a pneumothorax (hard to spot if apical or in a supine image, can you see vascular markings right out to the periphery?), surgical emphysema (trauma, iatrogenic), and gas under the diaphragm (surgery, perforated viscus, trauma). Pneumomediastinum: Air tracks along mediastinum, into the neck. Due to rupture of alveolar wall (eg asthma or pulmonary barotrauma) or bronchial or oesophageal trauma (can be iatrogenic, eg from endoscope). Pneumopericardium: Rare (usually iatrogenic).

## Bones 
Check the clavicles for fracture, ribs for fractures and lesions (eg metastases), vertebral column for degenerative disease, collapse, or destruction, and shoulders for dislocation, fracture, and arthritis.

## An apparently normal CXR? 
Check for tracheal compression, absent breast shadow (mastectomy), double left heart border (left lower lobe collapse, fig 16.5), fluid level behind the heart (hiatus hernia, achalasia), and paravertebral abscess (TB).
