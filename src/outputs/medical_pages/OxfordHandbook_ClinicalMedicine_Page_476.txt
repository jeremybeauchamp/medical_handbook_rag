# Vertigo and dizziness

## Is this vertigo?
Complaints of 'dizzy spells' are very common and are used by patients to describe many different sensations. True vertigo is a hallucination of movement, often rotatory, of the patient or their surroundings. In practice, simple 'spinning' is rare—the floor may tilt, sink, or rise. The key to diagnosis is to find out exactly what the patient means by 'dizzy:' if this is not vertigo or if atypical symptoms are present consider other causes, eg if there is loss of awareness, think of epilepsy or syncope; if there is faintness, lightheadedness, or palpitations, think of anaemia, dysrhythmia, anxiety, or hypotension.

**Associated symptoms:** Difficulty walking or standing (may fall suddenly to the ground), relief on lying or sitting still (vertigo is almost always worsened by movement); nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating. Associated hearing loss or tinnitus implies labyrinth or VIIIth nerve involvement.

## Causes

**Benign positional vertigo:** Occurs on head movement due to disruption of debris in the semicircular canal of the ears (canalolithiasis). Fatiguable nystagmus on performing the Hallpike manoeuvre is diagnostic; Epley manoeuvres clear the debris (OHCS p555).

**Acute labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis):** Abrupt onset of severe vertigo, nausea, vomiting ± prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe vertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3-4wks. ℞: reassure. Sedate.

**Ménière's disease:** Increased pressure in the endolymphatic system of the inner ear causes recurrent attacks of vertigo lasting >20min, fluctuating (or permanent) sensorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (with a sense of aural fullness ± falling to one side). ℞: bed rest and reassurance in acute attacks. An antihistamine (eg cinnarizine) is useful if prolonged, or buccal prochlorperazine if severe, for up to 7d.

**Ototoxicity:** Aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, or cisplatin can cause deafness ± vertigo.

**Acoustic neuroma:** (figs 10.12, 10.13) Doubly misnamed: it is a Schwannoma (not neuroma) arising from the vestibular (not auditory) nerve. They account for 80% of cerebellopontine angle tumours and often present with unilateral hearing loss, with vertigo occurring later. Growth rate is slow (usually 1-2 mm/year) and can be predicted by serial MRIs. With progression, ipsilateral Vth, VIth, IXth, and Xth nerves may be affected (also ipsilateral cerebellar signs). Signs of ↑ ICP occur late, indicating a large tumour. Commoner in ♀ and neurofibromatosis (esp. NF2, p514).

**Traumatic damage:** If trauma affects the petrous temporal bone or the cerebellopontine angle then the auditory nerve may be damaged, causing vertigo, deafness, and/or tinnitus.

**Herpes zoster:** Herpetic eruption of the external auditory meatus; facial palsy ± deafness, tinnitus, and vertigo (Ramsay Hunt syndrome, see p501).

**Others:** Vertiginous epilepsy; MS; stroke/TIA; migraine; motion sickness; alcohol intoxication.
