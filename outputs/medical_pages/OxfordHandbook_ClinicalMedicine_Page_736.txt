# Chest x-ray—part 1

Images are usually taken on inspiration with the x-ray source behind the patient (postero-anterior, PA). Mobile images may be antero-posterior (AP, fig 16.6), magnifying heart size. If supine, distribution of air and fluid in lungs and pleural cavities is altered and the diaphragm is elevated.

Acclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memorably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and 'water'/soft tissue. Each has its own radiographic density. A border is only seen at an interface of two densities, eg heart (soft tissue) and lung (air); this 'silhouette' is lost if air in the lung is replaced by consolidation ('water'). The silhouette sign localizes pathology (eg middle lobe pneumonia or collapse causing loss of clarity of the right heart border, fig 16.2). When interpreting a CXR use a systematic approach that works for you, eg:

## Technical quality
- **Rotation:** The sternal ends of the clavicles should symmetrically overlie the transverse processes of the 4th or 5th thoracic vertebrae. A rotated image can alter the position of structures, eg rotation to the right projects the aortic arch vessels over the right upper zone, appearing as though there is a mass.
- **Inspiration:** There should be 5 to 7 ribs visible anteriorly (or 10 posteriorly). Hyperinflation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as the heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding of vessels at the lung bases can mimic consolidation or collapse. This is common in patients who are acutely unwell, particularly those in pain or unconscious. Take care in interpreting these images.
- **Exposure:** An under-exposed image will be too white and an over-exposed image will be too black. Both cause a loss of definition and quality although some compensation can be made with standard viewing software.
- **Position:** The entire lung margin should be visible.

## Trachea
Normally central or just to the right. Deviated by collapse (towards the lesion), expansion (away from the lesion), or patient rotation.

## Mediastinum
May be: Widened by mediastinal fat; retrosternal thyroid; aortic aneurysm/unfolding; lymph node enlargement (sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastases, TB); tumour (thymoma, teratoma); cysts (bronchogenic, pericardial); paravertebral mass (TB). Shifted towards a collapsed lung or away from processes that add volume (eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax).

There are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum that help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to inferior they are: 1 Aortic knuckle. 2 Pulmonary outflow tract. 3 Left ventricle.

## Hila
The left hilum is higher than the right or at the same level (not lower); they should be the same size and density. The hila may be: Pulled up or down by fibrosis or collapse. Enlarged by: pulmonary arterial hypertension; bronchogenic ca; lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma can give bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Calcified due to: sarcoid, past TB; silicosis; histoplasmosis (p408).

## Heart
Normally less than half of the width of the thorax (cardiothoracic ratio <0.5). ⅓ should lie to the right of the vertebral column, ⅔ to the left. It may appear elongated if the chest is hyperinflated (COPD); or enlarged if the image is AP or if there is LV failure (fig 16.3), or a pericardial effusion. Are there calcified valves?

## Diaphragm
The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised hemidiaphragm: Trouble above the diaphragm—lung volume loss or inflammation. Trouble with the diaphragm—stroke; phrenic nerve palsy (causes, p504; any mediastinal mass?). Trouble below the diaphragm—hepatomegaly; subphrenic abscess. NB: subpulmonic effusion (effusions having a similar contour to the diaphragm without a characteristic meniscus) and diaphragm rupture give apparent elevation. NB: bilateral palsies (polio, muscular dystrophy) cause hypoxia.
