# 508 Cervical spondylosis

Degeneration of the cervical spine with age is inevitable, and has a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to progressive spastic quadriparesis and sensory loss due to compression of the cord (myelopathy).

## Pathogenesis
Degeneration of the annulus fibrosus (the tough coating of the intervertebral discs), combined with osteophyte formation on the adjacent vertebra leads to narrowing of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina (figs 10.27, 10.28). As the neck flexes and extends, the cord is dragged over these protruding bony spurs anteriorly and indented by a thickened ligamentum flavum posteriorly.

## Presenting complaint
Neck stiffness (but common in anyone >50yrs old), crepitus on moving neck, stabbing or dull arm pain (brachialgia), forearm/wrist pain.

## Signs
Limited, painful neck movement ± crepitus (examine gently). Neck flexion may produce tingling down the spine (Lhermitte's sign, p497). NB: this does not distinguish between cord or roots (or both) involvement.

### Root compression (radiculopathy):
Pain/'electrical' sensations in arms or fingers at the level of the compression (table 10.11), with numbness, dull reflexes, LMN weakness, and eventual wasting of muscles innervated by the affected root. NB: UMN signs below level of the affected root suggests cord compression.

### Features of cord compression:
Progressive symptoms (eg tweak, clumsy hands; gait disturbance); UMN leg signs (spastic weakness, tplantars); LMN arm signs (wasting, hyporeflexia); incontinence, hesitancy, and urgency are late features.

## Which nerve root is affected?
See table 10.11.

## Differential Diagnosis
MS; nerve root neurofibroma; subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12); compression by bone or cord tumours.

## Management
Urgent MRI and specialist referral guided by red flag symptoms (see p542). Bear in mind that although these are stressed in virtually every set of guidelines, no two lists are alike and review of evidence suggests that the accuracy of these features is low. Don't make referral decisions based upon the presence or absence of a single feature, but use these to inform your judgement. Otherwise: give analgesia (as per WHO ladder) and encourage gentle activity. Cervical collars may give respite during brief periods of increased pain, but restrict mobility, so may prolong symptoms: avoid where possible. If no improvement in 4-6 weeks then MRI and consider neurosurgical referral for: interlaminar cervical epidural injections, transforaminal injections or surgical decompression (via anterior approach, eg discectomy or posterior approach, eg laminectomy—fig 10.29, or laminoplasty—fig 10.30). There is no consensus or high-quality evidence to guide selection of approach or of patients, though interventions may be best reserved for those with progressive deterioration, myelopathy causing disabling neurologic deficits, or those at risk for deterioration (eg severe spinal cord compression on MRI).
