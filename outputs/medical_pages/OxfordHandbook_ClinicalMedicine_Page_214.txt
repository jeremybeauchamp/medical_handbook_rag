# Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)

This is a type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Inflammatory cell infiltrate and pulmonary fibrosis of unknown cause. It is the commonest cause of interstitial lung disease.

**Symptoms** Dry cough; exertional dyspnoea; malaise; ↓weight; arthralgia.

**Signs** Cyanosis; finger clubbing; fine end-inspiratory crepitations.

**Complications** Respiratory failure; ↑risk of lung cancer.

**Tests** 
- *Blood:* ABG (↓PO₂; if severe, ↑PCO₂); ↑CRP; ↑immunoglobulins; ANA (30% +ve), rheumatoid factor (10% +ve). 
- *Imaging:* (fig 4.20) ↓Lung volume; bilateral lower zone reticulo-nodular shadows; honeycomb lung (advanced disease). 
- *CT:* Shows similar changes to the CXR but is more sensitive and is an essential for diagnosis. 
- *Spirometry:* Restrictive (p162); ↓transfer factor. 
- *BAL:* May indicate activity of alveolitis: ↑lymphocytes (good response/prognosis) or ↑neutrophils and ↑eosinophils (poor response/prognosis). 
- *⁹⁹ᵐTc-DTPA scan:* (diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid) May reflect disease activity. 
- *Lung biopsy:* May be needed for diagnosis. The histological changes observed on biopsy are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

**Management** Supportive care: oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, opiates, palliative care input. All patients should be considered for current clinical trials or lung transplantation. It is strongly recommended that high-dose steroids are not used except where the diagnosis of IPF is in doubt.

**Prognosis** 50% 5yr survival rate (range 1-20yrs).

## A new treatment emerges for sufferers of IPF

Nintedanib and pirfenidone have been shown to slow disease progression and offer some hope to sufferers of IPF. Pirfenidone, an immunosuppressant and antifibrotic agent, showed a reduction in the rate of lung scarring and has been shown to improve life expectancy compared to best supportive care. Nintedanib targets three growth factor receptors involved in pulmonary fibrosis.
