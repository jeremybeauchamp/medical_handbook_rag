# Examination of the abdomen

Begin by introducing yourself, obtaining consent to examine, and position the patient appropriately; lie the patient down as flat as possible, ideally exposing from 'nipples to knees'. In practice, keep the groin covered and examine separately for hernias, etc.

## 1 General inspection

- Assess general state (ill/well/cachexic)
- Clues (vomit bowl, stoma bags, catheter, urine colour)
- Colour (pale, jaundiced, uraemic)
- Body mass index?
- Scars on the abdomen? Stomas (fig 2.25)?
- Ask the patient to lift their head off the bed, or cough, looking for bulges, distension or pain.

## 2 Hands

- Inspect: Clubbing, koilonychia, leuconychia, Muehrcke's lines, palmar erythema, Dupuytren's contracture (fig 2.26), pigmentation of the palmer creases
- Asterixis: (See p50)

## 3 Arms

- Check pulse and blood pressure
- Look in the distribution of the SVC (arms, upper chest, upper back) for spider naevi (fig 2.27)
- Check for track marks, bruising, pigmentation, scratch marks, arteriovenous fistulae (see p303 for signs seen in patients with chronic kidney disease)

## 4 Neck

- Examine cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes (see fig 2.28)
- JVP raised in fluid overload (renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction), tricuspid regurgitation (may cause pulsatile hepatomegaly)
- Scars from tunnelled haemodialysis lines (see p303) or other central venous access

## 5 Face

- Skin and eyes: Jaundice, conjunctival pallor, Kayserâ€“Fleischer rings, xanthelasma (see fig 2.29), sunken eyes (dehydration)
