# Paraproteinaemia

Paraproteinaemia denotes the presence in the circulation of immunoglobulins produced by a single clone of plasma cells. The paraprotein is recognized as a monoclonal band (M band) on serum electrophoresis. There are six major categories:

1. **Multiple myeloma** See p368.
2. **Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia** This is a lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma producing a monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Hyperviscosity is common (p372), with CNS and ocular symptoms. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are also seen. ↑ESR, with IgM paraprotein on serum electrophoresis. ℞: None if asymptomatic. Chlorambucil, fludarabine, or combination chemotherapy may be used. Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity (p372).
3. **Primary amyloidosis** See following topic.
4. **Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS)** is common (3% >70yrs). There is a paraprotein in the serum but no myeloma, 1° amyloid, macroglobulinaemia, or lymphoma, with no bone lesions, no Bence Jones protein, and a low concentration of paraprotein, with <10% plasma cells in the marrow. Some develop myeloma or lymphoma. Refer to a haematologist (?for marrow biopsy).
5. **Paraproteinaemia in lymphoma or leukaemia** Eg seen in 5% of CLL.
6. **Heavy chain disease** Neoplastic cells produce free Ig heavy chains. γ chain disease is most important, causing malabsorption from infiltration of bowel wall (immunoproliferative small intestine disease—IPSID). It may progress to lymphoma.

# Amyloidosis

This is a group of disorders characterized by extracellular deposits of a protein in abnormal fibrillar form, resistant to degradation. The following are the systemic forms of amyloidosis. Amyloid deposition is also a feature of Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and haemodialysis-related amyloidosis.

**AL amyloid (primary amyloidosis)** Proliferation of plasma cell clone → Amyloidogenic monoclonal immunoglobulins → Fibrillar light chain protein deposition → Organ failure → Death. Associations: myeloma (15%); Waldenström's, lymphoma.

Organs involved:
- Kidneys: glomerular lesions—proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome.
- Heart: restrictive cardiomyopathy (looks 'sparkling' on echo), arrhythmias, angina.
- Nerves: peripheral and autonomic neuropathy; carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Gut: macroglossia (big tongue), ↓malabsorption/weight, perforation, haemorrhage, obstruction, and hepatomegaly.
- Vascular: purpura, especially periorbital—a characteristic feature (fig 8.74).

℞: optimize nutrition; PO melphalan + prednisolone extends survival. High-dose IV melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation may be better.

**AA amyloid (secondary amyloidosis)** Here amyloid is derived from serum amyloid A, an acute phase protein, reflecting chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, UC/Crohn's, familial Mediterranean fever, and chronic infections—TB, bronchiectasis, osteomyelitis. It affects kidneys, liver, and spleen (fig 8.75), and may present with proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatosplenomegaly. Macroglossia is not seen; cardiac involvement is rare (ventricular hypertrophy and murmurs). ℞: manage the underlying condition optimally.

**Familial amyloidosis** (Autosomal dominant, eg from mutations in transthyretin, a transport protein produced by the liver.) Usually causes a sensory or autonomic neuropathy ± renal or cardiac involvement. Liver transplant can cure.

**Diagnosis:** Made with biopsy of affected tissue, and positive Congo Red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The rectum or subcutaneous fat are relatively non-invasive sites for biopsy and are +ve in 80%.

**Prognosis:** Median survival is 1-2 years. Patients with myeloma and amyloidosis have a shorter survival than those with myeloma alone.

9 Electrophoresis and plasmapheresis look as though they should share endings, but they do not: Greek phoros = bearing (esis = process), but aphairesis is Greek for removal.
