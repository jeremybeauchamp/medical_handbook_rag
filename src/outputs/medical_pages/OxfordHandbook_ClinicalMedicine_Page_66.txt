## The respiratory system: examination 2

### General inspection
'Comfortable at rest' or unwell? Cachectic? *Respiratory dis-tress?* (if high negative intrathoracic pressures are needed to generate air entry). Stridor? *Respiratory rate, breathing pattern* (see BOX 'Breathing patterns'). Look for *chest wall and spine deformities* (see p55). Inspect for scars of past surgery, chest drains, or radiotherapy (skin thickening, tattoos for radiotherapy). *Chest wall move-ment:* symmetrical? (if not, pathology on restricted side). Paradoxical respiration? (abdomen sucked in with inspiration; seen in diaphragmatic paralysis, see p502).

### Hands
Clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tar stains, fine tremor (β-agonist use), wasting of intrinsic muscles (T1 lesions, eg Pancoast's tumour, p708). Tender wrists (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy—cancer). Asterixis (CO2 retention). Pulse: paradoxical (respiratory distress), bounding (CO2 retention).

### Face
Ptosis and constricted pupil (Horner's syndrome, eg Pancoast's tumour, p708)? Bluish tongue and lips (central cyanosis, p34)? Conjunctival pallor (anaemia)?

### Neck
*Trachea:* Central or displaced? (towards collapse or away from large pleural effusion/tension pneumothorax; slight deviation to right is normal). Cricosternal distance <3cm is hyperexpansion. *Tracheal tug:* descent of trachea with inspiration (severe airflow limitation). *Lymphadenopathy:* TB/Ca? *JVP:* ↑ in cor pulmonale.

### Palpation
*Apex beat:* Impalpable? (COPD/pleural effusion/dextrocardia?) *Ex-pansion:* <5cm on deep inspiration is abnormal. Symmetry? *Tactile vocal fremitus:* ↑ implies consolidation.

### Percussion
*Dull percussion note:* Collapse, consolidation, fibrosis, pleural thickening, or pleural effusion ('stony dull'). *Cardiac dullness* usually detectable over the left side. *Liver dullness* usually extends up to 5th rib, right mid-clavicular line; below this, resonant chest is a sign of lung hyperexpansion (eg asthma, COPD). *Hyper-resonant percussion note:* Pneumothorax or hyperinflation (COPD).

### Table 2.8 Auscultation

| Breath sounds | Description | Pathology |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Vesicular | Rustling quality | Normal |
| Bronchial breathing | Harsh with gap between inspiration and expiration. Increased vocal reso-nance and whispering pectoriloquy | Consolidation, localized fibro-sis, above pleural/pericardial effusion (Ewart's sign, p154) |
| Diminished breath sounds | Difficult to hear | Pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pneumothorax, bronchial obstruction, asthma, or COPD |
| Silent chest | Inaudible breath sounds | Life-threatening asthma |
| Wheeze (rhonchi) | Air expired through narrow airways<br>• Monophonic (single note, partial obstruction one airway)<br>• Polyphonic (multiple notes, wide-spread airway narrowing) | • Tumour occluding airway<br>• Asthma, cardiac wheeze (LVF) |
| Crackles (crepitations) | Reopening of small airways on inspiration<br>• Fine and late in inspiration<br>• Coarse and mid inspiratory<br>• Early inspiratory<br>• Late/pan inspiratory<br>• Disappear post cough | • Pulmonary oedema<br>• Bronchiectasis<br>• Small airway disease<br>• Alveolar disease<br>• Insignificant |
| Pleural rub | Movement of visceral pleura over parietal when both are roughened (eg due to inflammatory exudate) | • Pneumonia<br>• Pulmonary infarction |
| Pneumothorax click | Shallow left pneumothorax between layers of parietal pleura overlying heart, heard during cardiac systole | |
