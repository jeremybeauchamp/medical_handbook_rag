## Examination
### Rash:
- Maculopapular: dengue, chikungunya, EBV, HIV seroconversion, VHF.
- Purpuric: dengue, meningococcal infection, plague, DIC, VHF.
- Ulcer: trypanosomiasis, Yesinia pestis, tick typhus, anthrax, tropical ulcer.

Jaundice: Viral hepatitis, severe falciparum malaria, enteric fever, leptospirosis, relapsing fever, typhus, VHF, bartonellosis

Hepatosplenomegaly: Viral hepatitis, HIV, enteric fever, brucellosis, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection, relapsing fever, schistosomiasis, amoebic liver abscess, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis.

## Investigation
Directed by travel history and examination. In undifferentiated fever:
- Malaria film/rapid diagnostic testing (p417).
- HIV test (p399).
- FBC: lymphopenia in viral infection including HIV; eosinophilia in parasitic/fungal eg soil-transmitted helminths, filiariasis, schistosomiasis, hydatid disease; ↓platelets in malaria, dengue, HIV, typhoid, severe sepsis.
- Blood culture ×2: prior to antibiotics.
- LFT.
- Consider: save serum, specific serology, or EDTA sample for PCR.

## Enteric fever: typhoid and paratyphoid
~20 million cases and 200 000 deaths per year worldwide, ~500/yr in UK mostly imported from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Caused by related, Gram-negative strains of 'typhoidal' Salmonella spp:
- Typhoid (~75-90%): Salmonella typhi.
- Paratyphoid (~10-25%, less severe): Salmonella paratyphi serotype A>B>C.

The bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa. Dissemination occurs without a primary diarrhoeal response. This distinguishes 'typhoidal' from 'non-typhoidal' serovars of Salmonella which cause D&V (p428). Transmission is faecal-oral from contaminated water/food. Incubation 6-30d (most 10-20d). ~10 000 organisms are required to cause illness. Can be asymptomatic (but shed organism).

Symptoms: Fatigue, headache, anorexia. Marked fever, 'stepwise' (rising through each day with progressive peaks) in <20%. Abdominal pain, relative bradycardia (Faget's sign), cough, constipation. Rose spots in ~25% (salmon-coloured, 1-4cm, blanching, due to bacterial emboli to dermis). Diarrhoea ('pea-soup') and hepatosplenomegaly in 2nd week. Progressive toxicity and complicated disease in up to 10%: intestinal haemorrhage/perforation, myocarditis, hepatitis, pneumonia, DIC, CNS involvement (delirium, meningism, encephalitis, cerebellar signs, fits, coma), eye complications (corneal ulcer, uveitis, neuritis, thrombosis).

Diagnosis: Isolation of S. typhi from: blood (take multiple cultures of 10-15mL in first 10d to ↑ sensitivity), bone marrow, intestinal secretions, or stool (↑sensitivity after 1st week). Serology has ↓ sensitivity and specificity, not sufficient as sole diagnostic tool (Widal test is -ve in ~30% of culture-proven cases). LFT. PCR (not routine).

Treatment: Azithromycin ± IV ceftriaxone. >70% imported from Asia are resistant to fluoroquinolones. Fever takes median 5-7d to respond due to intracellular niche of organism. Antipyretics, fluid management, nutrition. CNS disease: dexamethasone 3mg/kg IV then 1mg/kg/6h for 8 doses (limited data).

Vaccine: Ty21a (oral, live, CI: immunosuppression, pregnancy) or Vi (IM, capsular vaccine). ~50-80% effective for ~3yr. Limited/no protection against paratyphoid.
