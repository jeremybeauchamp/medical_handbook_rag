Fig 8.1 Here we see William Blake's Los working alone and at night, hammering a red cell into shape in the forge of the human heart. 'For every space larger than a red globule of Man's blood/ Is visionary, and is created by the Hammer of Los:/ And every Space smaller than a Globule of Man's blood opens/ Into Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow./ The red Globule is the unwearied Sun by Los created./ To measure Time and Space to mortal Men ...' (William Blake's Milton (1804-1810), lines 17-24.) When we ourselves are working alone and at night, hammering away at some difficult problem within the arteries of the hospital, we can lose sight of the context in which our own red globule sits. Unfortunately, as with Los' task, ours is one with an eternity of duties within and external to it. Rather than becoming overwhelmed by a seemingly endless job list, we must take our focus from the single red cell to the surrounding interconnected systems; by prioritizing our tasks and asking for help when we need it, we might not face such a solitary and interminable fate.
