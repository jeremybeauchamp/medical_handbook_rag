# Devic's syndrome and multiple sclerosis

## Table 15.1 Distinguishing Devic's syndrome from multiple sclerosis

| | Devic's syndrome | Multiple sclerosis |
|---|---|---|
| Course | Monophasic or relapsing | Relapsing usually; see p496 |
| Attack severity | Usually severe | Often mild |
| Respiratory failure | ~30%, from cervical myelitis | Rare |
| MRI head | Usually normal | Many periventricular white-matter lesions |
| MRI cord lesions | Longitudinal, central | Multiple, small, peripheral |
| CSF oligoclonal bands | Absent | Present |
| Permanent disability | Unusual, and attack-related | In late progressive disease |
| Other autoimmunities | In ≤50% (eg Sjögren's) | Uncommon |

**Diagnostic criteria for Devic's:** Optic neuritis, myelitis, and ≥2 out of 3 of: 
- MRI evidence of a continuous cord lesion for ≥3 segments. 
- Brain MRI at onset non-diagnostic for MS. 
- NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4) serum or CSF positivity (poorer prognosis).

NB: CNS involvement beyond the optic nerves and cord is compatible with NMO.

## Fig 15.3 Dupuytren's contracture of the 5th finger.

The image shows a hand with the 5th finger (pinky) bent inward towards the palm, demonstrating Dupuytren's contracture. The other fingers appear normal. There is a visible scar on the index finger, which the caption notes is from previous surgery.
