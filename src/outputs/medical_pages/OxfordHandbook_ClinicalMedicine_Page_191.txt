# Fungi and the lung

## Aspergillus
This group of fungi affects the lung in five ways:

1. **Asthma**: Type I hypersensitivity reaction to fungal spores (p178).

2. **Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)**: Results from type I and III hypersensitivity reactions to Aspergillus fumigatus. Affects 1-5% of asthmatics, 2-25% of CF patients. Initially bronchoconstriction, then permanent damage occurs causing bronchiectasis (fig 4.9). Symptoms: wheeze, cough, sputum (plugs of mucus containing fungal hyphae, see p408), dyspnoea, and 'recurrent pneumonia'. Investigations: CXR (transient segmental collapse or consolidation, bronchiectasis); Aspergillus in sputum; positive Aspergillus skin test and/or Aspergillus-specific IgE RAST (radioallergosorbent test); positive serum precipitins; eosinophilia; raised serum IgE. Treatment: prednisolone 30-40mg/24h PO for acute attacks; maintenance dose 5-10mg/d. Itraconazole can be used in combination with corticosteroids. Bronchodilators for asthma. Sometimes bronchoscopic aspiration of mucus plugs is needed.

3. **Aspergilloma (mycetoma)**: A fungus ball within a pre-existing cavity (often caused by TB or sarcoidosis). It is usually asymptomatic but may cause cough, haemoptysis (may be torrential), lethargy ± weight loss. Investigations: CXR (round opacity within a cavity, usually apical); sputum culture; strongly positive serum precipitins; Aspergillus skin test (30% +ve). Treatment (only if symptomatic): consider surgical excision for solitary symptomatic lesions or severe haemoptysis. Oral itraconazole and other antifungals have been tried with limited success. Local instillation of amphotericin paste under CT guidance yields partial success in carefully selected patients, eg in massive haemoptysis.

4. **Invasive aspergillosis**: Risk factors: immunocompromise, eg HIV, leukaemia, burns, Wegener's (p714), and SLE, or after broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Investigations: sputum culture; BAL; biopsy; serum precipitins; CXR (consolidation, abscess). Early chest CT and serial serum measurements of galactomannan (an Aspergillus antigen) may be helpful. Diagnosis may only be made at lung biopsy or autopsy. Treatment: voriconazole is superior to IV amphotericin. Alternatives: IV miconazole or ketoconazole (less effective). Prognosis: 30% mortality.

5. **Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA)**: See p198.

## Other fungal infections
Candida and Cryptococcus may cause pneumonia in the immunosuppressed (see p408).

| Aspergillosis |
|---------------|
| Aspergilloma within pre-existing cavity → Infection, Infarction, Malignant |
| Progression of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis → Bronchoconstriction and transient lung shadow → Upper lobe fibrosis, Proximal bronchiectasis, Mucoid impaction and lobar collapse |
