# 688 Plasma enzymes

Reference intervals vary between laboratories. See p752 for a guide to normal values.

Raised levels of specific enzymes can be a useful indicator of a disease. However, remember that most can be raised for other reasons too. Levels may be raised due to cellular damage, cell turnover, cellular proliferation (malignancy), enzyme induction, and clearance. The major causes of raised enzymes:

## Alkaline phosphatase (Several distinguishable isoforms exist, eg liver and bone.)
- Liver disease (suggests cholestasis; also cirrhosis, abscess, hepatitis, or malignancy).
- Bone disease (isoenzyme distinguishable, reflects osteoblast activity) especially Paget's, growing children, healing fractures, bone metastases, osteomalacia, osteomyelitis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism.
- Congestive cardiac failure (moderately raised).
- Pregnancy (placenta makes its own isoenzyme).

## Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST)
- Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).
- AST also ↑ in MI, skeletal muscle damage (especially crush injuries), and haemolysis.

## α-Amylase
- Acute pancreatitis (smaller rise in chronic pancreatitis as less tissue remaining).
- Also: severe uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe gastroenteritis, and peptic ulcer.

## Creatine kinase (CK) ▶A raised CK does not necessarily mean an MI.
- Myocardial infarction (p118; isoenzyme 'CK-MB'. Diagnostic if CK-MB >6% of total CK, or CK-MB mass >99 percentile of normal). CK returns to baseline within 48h (unlike troponin, which remains raised for ~10 days), ∴ useful for detecting re-infarction.
- Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis, p319; prolonged running; haematoma; seizures; IM injection; defibrillation; bowel ischaemia; myxoedema; dermatomyositis, p552)—and drugs (eg statins).

## Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, γGT)
- Liver disease (particularly alcohol-induced damage, cholestasis, drugs).

## Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
- Myocardial infarction (p118).
- Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage).
- Haemolysis (esp. sickle cell crisis), pulmonary embolism, and tumour necrosis.

## Troponin
- Subtypes troponin T and troponin I are used clinically.
- Cardiac damage or strain (MI—p118, pericarditis, myocarditis, PE, sepsis, CPR).
- Chronic kidney disease (troponin T only; elevation less marked; aetiology unknown).
