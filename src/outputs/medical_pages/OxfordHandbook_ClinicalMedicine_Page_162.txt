# Right heart valve disease

## Tricuspid regurgitation
**Causes:** Functional (RV dilatation; eg due to pulmonary hypertension induced by LV failure or PE); rheumatic fever; infective endocarditis (IV drug abuser⁵); carcinoid syndrome; congenital (eg ASD, AV canal, Ebstein's anomaly (downward displacement of the tricuspid valve—see OHCS p642)); drugs (eg ergot-derived dopamine agonists, p495; fenfluramine). 
**Symptoms:** Fatigue; hepatic pain on exertion (due to hepatic congestion); ascites; oedema and symptoms of the causative condition. 
**Signs:** Giant v waves and prominent y descent in JVP (p43); RV heave; pansystolic murmur, heard best at lower sternal edge in inspiration; pulsatile hepatomegaly; jaundice; ascites. 
**Management:** Drugs: diuretics for systemic congestion; drugs to treat underlying cause. Valve repair or replacement (~10% 30-day mortality). Tricuspid regurgitation resulting from myocardial dysfunction or dilatation has a mortality of up to 50% at 5 yrs.

## Tricuspid stenosis
**Causes:** Main cause is rheumatic fever, which almost always occurs with mitral or aortic valve disease. Also: congenital, infective endocarditis.
**Symptoms:** Fatigue, ascites, oedema. 
**Signs:** Giant a wave and slow y descent in JVP (p43); opening snap, early diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal edge in inspiration. AF can also occur. 
**Diagnosis:** Echo. 
**Treatment:** Diuretics; surgical repair.

## Pulmonary stenosis
**Causes:** Usually congenital (Turner syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Williams syndrome, Fallot's tetralogy, rubella). Acquired causes: rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome. 
**Symptoms:** Dyspnoea; fatigue; oedema; ascites. 
**Signs:** Dysmorphic facies (congenital causes); prominent a wave in JVP; RV heave. In mild stenosis, there is an ejection click, ejection systolic murmur (which radiates to the left shoulder); widely split S₂. In severe stenosis, the murmur becomes longer and obscures A₂. P₂ becomes softer and may be inaudible. 
**Tests:** ECG: RAD, P-pulmonale, RVH, RBBB; echo/TOE (p110); CXR: prominent pulmonary arteries caused by post-stenotic dilatation. Cardiac catheterization is diagnostic. 
**Treatment:** Pulmonary valvuloplasty or valvotomy.

## Pulmonary regurgitation
**Causes:** Any cause of pulmonary hypertension (p194).
**Signs:** Decrescendo murmur in early diastole at the left sternal edge (the Graham Steell murmur if associated with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension).

# Cardiac surgery

Cardiac surgery has come on a long way since 1923 when Dr Henry Souttar⁵⁸,⁵⁹ used his finger to open a stenosed mitral valve in a beating heart.⁶ Cardiac bypass allows prolonged access to the open, static heart, during which complex and high-precision repair and replacement of valves and aortic roots can occur. Transcatheter procedures are playing an increasing role in the management of cardiovascular disease.

Key open heart procedures include:

## Valve replacements
Mechanical valves may be of the ball-cage (Starr-Edwards), tilting disc (Bjork-Shiley), or double tilting disc (St Jude) type. These valves are very durable but the risk of thromboembolism is high; patients require lifelong anticoagulation. Xenografts are made from porcine valves or pericardium. These valves are less durable and may require replacement at 8-10yrs but have the advantage of not necessitating anticoagulation. Homografts are cadaveric valves. They are particularly useful in young patients and in the replacement of infected valves. Complications of prosthetic valves: systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, haemolysis, structural valve failure, arrhythmias.

## CABG
See p123.

## Cardiac transplantation
Consider this when cardiac disease is severely curtailing quality of life, and survival is not expected beyond 6-12 months.

## Surgery for congenital heart defects
See p156.

## Aortic root surgery
Replacement/repair if dissection or aneurysmal.

⁵ Remember that it is the tricuspid valve which is the valve most vulnerable to events arriving by vein, eg pathogens from IV drug abusers or hormones (particularly 5-HT) from carcinoid tumours.
