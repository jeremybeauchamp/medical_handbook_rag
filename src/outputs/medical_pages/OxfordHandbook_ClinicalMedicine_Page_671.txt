## Acute limb ischaemia

**Surgery**
Surgical emergency requiring revascularization within 4-6h to save the limb. May be due to thrombosis in situ (~40%), emboli (38%), graft/angioplasty occlusion (15%), or trauma. Thrombosis more likely in known 'vasculopaths'; emboli are sudden, eg in those without previous vessel disease; they can affect multiple sites, and there may be a bruit. Mortality: 22%. Amputation rate: 16%.

- **Symptoms and signs:** The 6 'P's of acute ischaemia: pale, pulseless, painful, paralysed, paraesthetic, and 'perishingly cold'. Onset of fixed mottling implies irreversibility. Emboli commonly arise from the heart (AF; mural thrombus) or aneurysms. In patients with known PAD, sudden deterioration of symptoms with deep duskiness of the limb may indicate acute arterial occlusion. This appearance is due to extensive pre-existing collaterals and must not be misdiagnosed as gout/cellulitis.

- **Management:** This is an emergency and may require urgent open surgery or angioplasty. If diagnosis is in doubt, do urgent arteriography. If the occlusion is embolic, the options are surgical embolectomy (Fogarty catheter) or local thrombolysis, eg tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, p345), balancing the risks of surgery with the haemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis.

- Anticoagulate with heparin after either procedure and look for the source of emboli. Be aware of possible post-op reperfusion injury and subsequent compartment syndrome.
