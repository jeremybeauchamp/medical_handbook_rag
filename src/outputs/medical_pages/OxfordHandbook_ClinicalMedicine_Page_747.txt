Fig 16.16 Triple-phase CT abdomen, cropped to show the pancreas.

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Top panel | Unenhanced image |
| Middle panel | Arterial phase of contrast medium to look for pseudocysts and parenchymal enhancement |
| Bottom panel | Portal venous phase to look at veins |

The history here was also central abdominal pain with a non-peritonitic abdomen. The CT shows an enlarged pancreatic head with fat stranding around the duodenopancreatic groove ('groove pancreatitis'), and two small areas of fluid attenuation posteriorly, likely to be pseudocysts.
