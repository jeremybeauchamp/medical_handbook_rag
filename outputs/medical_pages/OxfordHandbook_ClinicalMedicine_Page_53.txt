## 6 Face

- Colour: Pale, flushed, central cyanosis
- Features: Corneal/senile arcus (fig 2.7), xanthe-lasma (see fig 2.29, p60)
- Pallor of the conjunctiva (anaemia)
- Malar flush (mitral stenosis)
- Dental hygiene

## 7 The praecordium

### Inspect:
- Scars—midline sternotomy, lateral thoracotomy (mitral stenosis valvotomy).

### Palpate:
- Apex beat (lowermost lateral pulsation)—usually 5th intercostal space in mid-clavicular line; measure position by counting intercostal spaces (sternal notch = 2nd intercostal space). Undisplaced/displaced? Character: impalpable (?dextrocardia/COPD), tapping (palpable S1), double impulse, sustained/strong. Count rate if pulse irregular (AF, p130).
- 'Heaves' and 'thrills'—place the heel of the hand flat on chest to left then right of sternum. Heave: sustained, thrusting usually felt at left sternal edge (= right ventricular enlargement). Thrill: palpable murmur felt as a vibration beneath your hand.

### Auscultate: (palpate carotid pulse simultaneously)
- Apex (mitral area)—listen with bell and diaphragm. Identify 1st and 2nd heart sounds: are they normal? Listen for added sounds (p44) and murmurs (p46); with the diaphragm listen for a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla—mitral regurgitation (see fig 2.8).
- At apex with bell, ask the patient to 'Roll over onto your left side, breathe out, and hold it there' (a rumbling mid-diastolic murmur—mitral stenosis).
- Lower left sternal edge (tricuspid area) and pulmonary area (left of manubrium in the 2nd intercostal space): if suspect right-sided mumur, listen with patient's breath held in inspiration.
- Right of manubrium in 2nd intercostal space (aortic area)—ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids—aortic stenosis.
- Sit the patient up and listen at the lower left sternal edge with patient held in expiration (early diastolic murmur: aortic regurgitation?).

## 8 To complete the examination

- Palpate for sacral and ankle oedema (fig 2.9).
- Auscultate the lung bases for inspiratory crackles.
- Examine the abdomen for a pulsatile liver and aortic aneurysm.
- Check peripheral pulses, observation chart for temperature and O2 sats, dip urine, perform fundoscopy.
