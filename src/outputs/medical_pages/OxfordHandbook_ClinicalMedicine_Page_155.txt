The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with the following content:

| Lead | ECG Tracing |
|------|-------------|
| I    | Normal sinus rhythm with small QRS complexes |
| aVR  | Inverted QRS complexes |
| V1   | Small R waves, deep S waves |
| V4   | Tall R waves |
| II   | Normal sinus rhythm |
| aVL  | Small QRS complexes |
| V2   | Deep S waves, small R waves |
| V5   | Tall R waves |
| III  | Normal sinus rhythm |
| aVF  | Normal QRS complexes |
| V3   | Transition from deep S to tall R waves |
| V6   | Tall R waves |

Fig 3.41 Left ventricular hypertrophy—this is from a patient with malignant hypertension—note the sum of the S-wave in V2 and R-wave in V6 is greater than 35mm.
