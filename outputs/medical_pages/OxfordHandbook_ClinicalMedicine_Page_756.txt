# Gastrointestinal imaging

## Ultrasound
Widely used for imaging all intra-abdominal organs, including an emerging role in small bowel imaging (though overlying bowel gas can cast acoustic shadows). US is the 1st-line imaging choice for abnormal LFTs, jaundice, hepatomegaly, renal dysfunction, and abdominal masses. Ensure the patient is 'nil by mouth' for 4 hours beforehand (aids gallbladder filling). Pelvic US needs a full bladder (consider clamping the catheter if appropriate). US may also guide diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic aspiration of cysts or collections.

## CT
Plays an important role in the investigation of acute abdominal pain (see pp730-3). It is unparalleled in the detection of free gas and intra-abdominal collections, and allows good visualization of the colon and retroperitoneal areas. Oral or IV contrast medium enhances definition (p730). The big disadvantage is the radiation dose. CT colonography (CTC; fig 16.31) uses rectal air or CO2 insufflation, usually coupled with an oral 'stool tagging' agent to visualize the colonic mucosa in those unfit for endoscopic evaluation or in whom endoscopic evaluation has failed (eg in a stenosing tumour, where it can be used to assess the proximal colon and allow assessment of liver and nodal metastases at the same time). A negative test can be regarded as definitive but if polyps or masses are seen then patients will usually require a colonoscopy.

**Wireless capsule endoscopy:** See p248.

## Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
This gives excellent soft tissue imaging, giving it an important role in imaging the liver, biliary system, pancreas, and pancreatic duct (MRCPâ€”magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; fig 16.32). As well as assessing potential malignant disease, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for detection of common bile duct stones that can be missed on US. MRI performed after fluid loading of the small bowel (fluid delivered orally=MRI enterography; fluid delivered via nasoduodenal tube=MRI enteroclysis) permits assessment of small bowel inflammation (eg Crohn's) and lesions that can be challenging to reach with conventional endoscopy.

## Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; fig 16.33)
**Indications:** No longer routinely used for diagnosis, it still has a significant therapeutic role: sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones; stenting of benign or malignant strictures and obtaining brushings to diagnose the nature of a stricture. **Method:** A catheter is advanced from a side-viewing duodenoscope via the ampulla into the common bile duct. Contrast medium is injected and images taken to show lesions in the biliary tree and pancreatic ducts. **Complications:** Pancreatitis; bleeding; cholangitis; perforation. Mortality <0.2% overall; 0.4% if performing stone removal.

## Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS; see p736.)
Commonly used in diagnosis of upper GI abnormalities, and is excellent for diagnosis of oesophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. It allows staging by assessing depth of invasion, as well as histological diagnosis by biopsy of lesions.

## Contrast studies (fig 16.34)
These can help in dysphagia (p250) and assessing integrity of anastomoses post-op. Real-time fluoroscopic imaging studies assess swallowing function. Barium gives better contrast but iodine-based water-soluble contrast medium is used if there is a concern of perforation. Contrast enemas are increasingly obsolete and now used to exclude a leak following a low anterior resection, for proctograms, and not much else.
