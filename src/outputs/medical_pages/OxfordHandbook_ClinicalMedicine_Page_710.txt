696 Brown-Séquard syndrome A lesion in one half of the spinal cord (due to hemi-
section or unilateral cord lesion) causes: •Ipsilateral UMN weakness below the lesion
(severed corticospinal tract, causing spastic paraparesis, brisk reflexes, extensor
plantars). •Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration (dorsal column severed).
•Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation (severed spinothalamic tract
which has crossed over; fig 10.35 p516). Causes: Bullet, stab, tumour, disc hernia, my-
elitis,12 septic emboli. Imaging: MRI.

Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, 1817–1894 (Mauritian neurologist)

## Eponymous syndromes

### Budd-Chiari syndrome
Hepatic vein obstruction by thrombosis or tumour causes
congestive ischaemia and hepatocyte damage. Abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, as-
cites, and ↑ALT occur. Portal hypertension occurs in chronic forms. Causes: Include
hypercoagulable states (combined OCP, pregnancy, malignancy, paroxysmal noc-
turnal haemoglobinuria, polycythaemia, thrombophilia), TB, liver, renal, or adrenal
tumour. Tests: USS + Dopplers, CT, or MRI. Angioplasty or a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) may be needed. Anticoagulate (lifelong) unless there are
varices. Consider liver transplant in fulminant hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis.13

George Budd, 1808–1882 (British physician); Hans Chiari, 1851–1916 (Austrian pathologist)

### Buerger's disease
(Thromboangiitis obliterans.) Non-atherosclerotic smoking-
related inflammation and thrombosis of veins and middle-sized arteries causing
thrombophlebitis and ischaemia (→ulcers, gangrene). Cause: Unknown. Stopping
smoking is vital. Most patients are men aged 20-45yrs (see BOX 'Poisoning your
boss').

Leo Buerger, 1879–1943 (US physician)

### Caplan's syndrome
Multiple lung nodules in coal workers with RA, caused by an in-
flammatory reaction to anthracite (also associated with silica or asbestos exposure).
CXR: bilateral peripheral nodules (0.5-5cm). ∆∆: TB.

Anthony Caplan, 1907–1976 (British physician)

### Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome
(Peroneal muscular atrophy.) This inherited
neuropathy starts in puberty with weak legs and foot drop + variable loss of sensa-
tion and reflexes. The peroneal muscles atrophy, leading to an inverted champagne
bottle appearance. Atrophy of hand and arm muscles also occurs. The most common
form, CMT1A (PMP22 myelin gene mutation on chr. 17), has AD inheritance. Quality of life
is good; total incapacity rare. Hand pain/paraesthesiae may respond to nerve release.

Jean-Marie Charcot, 1825–1893; Pierre Marie, 1853–1940 (French neurologists); Howard H Tooth, 1856–1926 (British physician)

### Churg-Strauss syndrome
(Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.) A
triad of adult-onset asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis (± vasospasm ± MI ± DVT),
affecting lungs, nerves, heart, and skin. A septic-shock picture/systemic inflamma-
tory response syndrome may occur (with glomerulonephritis/renal failure, esp. if
ANCA +ve). ℞: Steroids; biological agents if refractory disease, eg rituximab.14

Jacob Churg, 1910–2005; Lotte Strauss, 1913–1985 (US pathologists)

### Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
The cause is a prion (PrPSc), a misfolded form of a
normal protein (PrPc), that can transform other proteins into prion proteins (hence its
infectivity). PrPSc leads to spongiform changes (tiny cavities ± tubulovesicular struc-
tures) in the brain.15 Most cases are sporadic (incidence: 1-3/million/yr). Variant CJD
(vCJD; ≈225 cases worldwide)16 is transmitted via contaminated CNS tissue affected by
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (see BOX 'Signs that may distinguish variant
CJD'). Inherited forms: (eg Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, P102L mutation
in PRNP gene with ataxia ± self-mutilation), the 'normal' protein is too unstable, readily
transforming to PrPSc. Iatrogenic causes: Contaminated surgical instruments, corneal
transplants, growth hormone from human pituitaries, and blood (vCJD only).17 Prion
protein resists sterilization. Signs: Progressive dementia, focal CNS signs, myoclonus
(present in 95%),18 depression, eye signs (diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual
disturbances, homonymous field defects, hallucinations, cortical blindness).19 Tests:
Tonsil/olfactory mucosa biopsy;20 CSF gel electrophoresis; MRI. Treatment: None proven.
Death occurs in ~6 months in sporadic CJD (a little slower in variant CJD). Prevention:
Regulations to ↓ spread of BSE and transmission to humans + ↓ iatrogenic transmission.

Hans G Creutzfeldt, 1885–1964 (German pathologist); Alfons M Jakob 1884–1931 (German neurologist)

### Crigler-Najjar syndrome
Two rare syndromes of inherited unconjugated hyper-
bilirubinaemia presenting in the 1st days of life with jaundice ± CNS signs. Cause:
Mutation in UGT enzyme activity causing absent (type 1) or impaired (type 2; mild)
ability to excrete bilirubin. ℞: T1: phototherapy and plasmapheresis to control jaun-
dice; liver transplant before irreversible kernicterus (OHCS p115) develops.21 T2: usually
no ℞ needed.

John F Crigler 1919–2002; Victor A Najjar b1914 (US paediatricians)
