# Hiatus hernia

## Sliding hiatus hernia (80%)
The gastro-oesophageal junction slides up into the chest—see fig 6.18. Acid reflux often happens as the lower oesophageal sphincter becomes less competent in many cases.

## Paraoesophageal hernia (rolling hiatus hernia) (20%)
The gastro-oesophageal junction remains in the abdomen but a bulge of stomach herniates up into the chest alongside the oesophagus—see figs 6.18, 6.19. As the gastro-oesophageal junction remains intact, GORD is less common.

## Clinical features
Common: 30% of patients >50yrs, especially obese women. Although most small hernias are asymptomatic, patients with large hernias may develop GORD.

## Imaging
Upper GI endoscopy visualizes the mucosa (?oesophagitis) but cannot reliably exclude a hiatus hernia.

## Treatment
Lose weight. Treat GORD. Surgery indications: intractable symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy, complications (see p254). Although paraoesophageal hernias may strangulate the risk of this drops dramatically after 65 yrs. Prophylactic repair is only undertaken in those considered at high risk, due to operative mortality (≈1–2%).
