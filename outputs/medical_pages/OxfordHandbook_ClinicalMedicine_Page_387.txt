# The spleen and splenectomy

The spleen plays a vital immunological role by acting as a reservoir for lymphocytes, and in dealing with bacteraemias.

## Causes of splenomegaly: (See also p604.)
- **Massive** (enlarged to the RIF): CML, myelofibrosis, malaria (hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly), visceral leishmaniasis, 'tropical splenomegaly' (idiopathic—Africa, south-east Asia), and Gaucher's syndrome. 
- **Moderate**: 
  - Infection (eg EBV, endocarditis, TB, malaria, leishmaniasis, schistosomiasis). 
  - Portal hypertension (liver cirrhosis). 
  - Haematological (haemolytic anaemia, leukaemia especially CML, lymphoma). 
  - Connective tissue disease (RA, SLE). 
  - Others: sarcoidosis, primary antibody deficiency (OHCS p198), idiopathic.

## When is a mass in the left upper quadrant a spleen: 
(Main differential: enlarged left kidney.) The spleen: 
- Is dull to percussion. 
- Enlarges towards the RIF. 
- Moves down on inspiration. 
- You may feel a medial notch. 
- 'You can't get above it' (ie the top margin disappears under the ribs).

## Tests: 
Image the spleen with abdominal USS or CT. Hunt for the cause of enlargement: look for lymphadenopathy and liver disease, eg: FBC, ESR, LFT ± liver, marrow, or lymph node biopsy.

## Complications: 
Symptoms of anaemia, infection, or bleeding can occur as a result of hypersplenism: cells become trapped in the spleen's reticuloendothelial system causing pancytopenia. Splenectomy may be required if severe.

## Splenectomy: 
Main indications: splenic trauma, hypersplenism, autoimmune haemolysis: in ITP (p345), warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (p338), or congenital haemolytic anaemias. Mobilize early post-splenectomy as transient platelets predisposes to thrombi. A characteristic blood film is seen following splenectomy, with Howell-Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and target cells (see p328).

**The main problem post-splenectomy is lifelong increased risk from infection.** The spleen contains macrophages which filter and phagocytose bacteria. Post-splenectomy infection is caused most commonly by encapsulated organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Reduce this risk by giving:

1. Immunizations:
   - Pneumococcal vaccine (p167), at least 2 weeks pre-op to ensure good response, or as soon as possible after emergency splenectomy, eg after trauma. Re-immunize every 5-10yrs. Avoid in pregnancy.
   - Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib, see p391).
   - Meningococcal vaccination course, including Men B, Men C, and Men ACWY.
   - Annual influenza vaccine (p396).

2. Life-long prophylactic oral antibiotics: phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V) or erythromycin if penicillin allergic.

3. Pendants, bracelets, or patient-held cards to alert medical staff.

4. Advice to seek urgent medical attention if any signs of infection: will require admission for broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection develops.

5. If travelling abroad, warn of risk of severe malaria and advise meticulous prophylaxis, with nets, repellent, and medication.

The advice given here also applies to hyposplenic patients, eg in sickle-cell anaemia or coeliac disease.
