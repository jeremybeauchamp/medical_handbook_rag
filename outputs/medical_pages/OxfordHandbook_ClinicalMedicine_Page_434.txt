## Mosquito-borne disease

Mosquito-borne diseases¹² are transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with a virus, bacteria, or parasite. The mosquito acts as the disease vector. Mosquitoes are arthropods (see table 9.21). Mosquito-borne diseases can therefore also be described as vector-borne or arthropod-borne disease. When a virus is transmitted by an arthropod it is termed an arbovirus (ARthropod-BOrne VIRUS).

### Malaria 
See pp416-9.

### Dengue
Most important arbovirus in humans. Dengue viruses (Flaviviruses DENV1-4) are transmitted by day-biting Aedes mosquito. 120 countries (fig 9.28). Symptoms in 100 million/yr. UK: ~500 imported cases/yr.

**Presentation:** Incubation 3-14d. Fever (up to 40°C), N&V, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, +ve tourniquet test (inflate BP cuff to midway between systolic and diastolic for 5 min≥10 petechiae/inch²). ►Warning signs/critical phase may occur 3-7d into illness and needs hospital admission: abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, hepatomegaly, ↑haematocrit + ↓plt. ►Severe disease: shock (includes postural BP drop >20mmHg), respiratory distress, severe bleeding, organ involvement (transaminases >1000, ↓GCS, other organ failure).

**Diagnosis:** PCR for virus/ELISA antigen³ during viraemia (~1st 5d of fever). Serology (IgM, IgG) after 5d. Also ↓plt, ↓WCC, transaminitis. (∆∆: Chikungunya, Zika.) 

**Treatment:** Supportive: prompt but careful fluid balance due to potential for plasma leak. IV crystalloid, to maintain effective circulation, only in severe disease. 20mL/kg over 15-30min if hypotensive shock. Monitor clinically and via haematocrit. Reduce IV fluid as soon as stable. Beware: plasma leak maintains haemocrit unless bleeding. Consider transfusion if ↓haematocrit without clinical improvement. Avoid NSAIDs.

### Chikungunya
Arbovirus (Alphavirus) transmitted by Aedes mosquito. Widespread: Asia, Africa, Europe, and Americas. Name derives from Kimakonde language meaning 'to become contorted' due to arthralgia. Blood-borne and vertical transmission possible, but rare. 

**Presentation:** Incubation 1-12d. Fever. Polyarthralgia: bilateral, symmetrical, can be severe, persistent. Headache, myalgia, N&V, maculopapular rash. 

**Diagnosis:** Viral culture/PCR (~1st 8d), serology. 

**Treatment:** Supportive. Analgesia.

### Yellow fever
Arbovirus (Flavivirus) spread by Aedes mosquitoes in Africa, South America. 

**Presentation:** Incubation ~3-6d. Viraemia ~3d with fever, headache, myalgia, anorexia, N&V, relative bradycardia (∆∆: enteric fever p415). ~15% have remission followed by severe symptoms ~48h later: epigastric pain, jaundice, AKI, cardiac instability, bleeding. Mortality 5%-30%. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical and travel history. Virus/PCR in 1st 3d.³ Serology: cross reacts with other flaviviruses, IgM can persist after vaccination. 

**Treatment:** Supportive. Live vaccine, effective for life (certificate for 10yr).
