# Angina pectoris

If ACS is a possible diagnosis (including unstable angina), see pp798-801.

Angina is symptomatic reversible myocardial ischaemia. Features:
1. Constricting/heavy discomfort to the chest, jaw, neck, shoulders, or arms.
2. Symptoms brought on by exertion.
3. Symptoms relieved within 5min by rest or GTN.

All 3 features = typical angina; 2 features = atypical angina; 0-1 features = non-anginal chest pain.

Other precipitants: emotion, cold weather, and heavy meals. Associated symptoms: dyspnoea, nausea, sweatiness, faintness. Features that make angina less likely: pain that is continuous, pleuritic or worse with swallowing; pain associated with palpitations, dizziness or tingling.

## Causes
Atheroma. Rarely: anaemia; coronary artery spasm; AS; tachyarrhythmias; HCM; arteritis/small vessel disease (microvascular angina/cardiac syndrome X).

## Types of angina
- Stable angina: Induced by effort, relieved by rest. Good prognosis.
- Unstable angina: (Crescendo angina.) Angina of increasing frequency or severity; occurs on minimal exertion or at rest; associated with ↑risk of MI.
- Decubitus angina: Precipitated by lying flat.
- Variant (Prinzmetal) angina: (BOX 'Vasospastic angina') Caused by coronary artery spasm (rare; may coexist with fixed stenoses).

## Tests
ECG usually normal, but may show ST depression; flat or inverted T waves; signs of past MI. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, TFTs, lipids, HbA1c. Consider echo and chest X-ray. Further investigations are usually necessary to confirm an IHD diagnosis—see BOX.

## Management

Address exacerbating factors: Anaemia, tachycardia (eg fast AF), thyrotoxicosis.

Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease:
- Stop smoking; exercise; dietary advice; optimize hypertension and diabetes control.
- 75mg aspirin daily if not contraindicated.
- Address hyperlipidaemia—see p690.
- Consider ACE inhibitors, eg if diabetic.

PRN symptom relief: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray or sublingual tabs. Advise the patient to repeat the dose if the pain has not gone after 5min and to call an ambulance if the pain is still present 5min after the second dose. SE: headaches, ↓BP.

Anti-anginal medication: (p114) First line: β-blocker and/or calcium channel blocker (do not combine β-blockers with non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists). If these fail to control symptoms or are not tolerated, trial other agents.

- β-blockers: eg atenolol 50mg BD or bisoprolol 5-10mg OD.
- Calcium antagonists: amlodipine—start at 5mg OD; diltiazem—dose depends on formulation.
- Long-acting nitrates: eg isosorbide mononitrate—starting regimen depends on formulation. Alternatives: GTN skin patches. SEs: headaches, ↓BP.
- Ivabradine: reduces heart rate with minimal impact on BP. Patient must be in sinus rhythm. Start with 5mg BD (2.5mg in elderly).
- Ranolazine: inhibits late Na+ current. Start at 375mg BD. Caution if heart failure, elderly, weight <60kg or prolonged QT interval.
- Nicorandil: a K+ channel activator. Start with 5-10mg BD. CI: acute pulmonary oedema, severe hypotension, hypovolaemia, LV failure.

Revascularization: Considered when optimal medical therapy proves inadequate.
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): (p112) a balloon is inflated inside the stenosed vessel, opening the lumen. A stent is usually inserted to reduce the risk of re-stenosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; usually aspirin and clopidogel) is recommended for at least 12 months after stent insertion to reduce the risk of in-stent thrombosis. Specialist advice should be sought regarding antiplatelets if the patient has a high bleeding risk or requires surgery.
- CABG: (p123) compared to PCI, patients undergoing CABG are less likely to need repeat revascularization and those with multivessel disease can expect better outcomes. However, CABG is open heart surgery and so recovery is slower and the patient is left with two large wounds (sternal and vein harvesting).
