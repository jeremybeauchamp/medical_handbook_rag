# Myeloma: the chief plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD)

PCDs are due to an abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma or lympho-plasmacytic cells leading to secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) or an Ig fragment, causing the dysfunction of many organs (esp kidney). The Ig is seen as a monoclonal band, or paraprotein, on serum or urine electrophoresis (see later in topic).

## Classification
Based on Ig product—IgG in ~⅔; IgA in ~⅓; a very few are IgM or IgD. Other Ig levels are low ('immunoparesis', causing ↑susceptibility to infection). In ~⅔, urine contains Bence Jones proteins, which are free Ig light chains of kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) type, filtered by the kidney.

## Incidence
5/100 000. Peak age: 70yrs. ♂:♀≈1:1. Afro-Caribbeans:Caucasians ≈2:1.

## Clinical features
- **Osteolytic bone lesions** cause backache, pathological fractures and vertebral collapse. ▶Do serum electrophoresis on all >50 with new back pain.
- **Hypercalcaemia** may be symptomatic (p676). Lesions are due to ↑osteoclast activation, from signalling by myeloma cells.
- **Anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia** may result from marrow infiltration by plasma cells, leading to symptoms of anaemia, infection, and bleeding.
- **Recurrent bacterial infections** due to immunoparesis, and also because of neutropenia due to the disease and from chemotherapy.
- **Renal impairment** due to light chain deposition (p314 & p370) is seen in up to 20% at diagnosis. The light chains have a toxic and inflammatory effect on the proximal tubule cells, but the damage is mainly caused by precipitation of light chains in the distal loop of Henle. Deposits may rarely be AL-amyloid (causing nephrotic syndrome, see p370). Monoclonal immunoglobulins also disrupt glomeruli.

## Tests
**Bloods:** FBC: normocytic normochromic anaemia. Film: rouleaux (p328). Persistently ↑ESR (p372). ↑Urea and creatinine, ↑Ca²⁺ (in ~40%). Alk phos usually ↔ unless healing fracture. **Bone marrow biopsy:** See figs 8.70-8.73. **Screening test:** Serum and/or urine electrophoresis. β₂-microglobulin (prognostic). **Imaging:** X-rays: lytic 'punched-out' lesions, eg pepper-pot skull, vertebral collapse, fractures, or osteoporosis. CT or MRI may be useful to detect lesions not seen on XR. **Diagnostic criteria:** See BOX 'Myeloma diagnosis'.

## Treatment
**Supportive:**
- Analgesia for bone pain (avoid NSAIDs due to risk of renal impairment). Give all patients a bisphosphonate (clodronate, zolendronate, or pamidronate), as they reduce fracture rates and bone pain. Local radiotherapy can help rapidly in focal disease. Orthopaedic procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) may be helpful in vertebral collapse. 
- Anaemia should be corrected with transfusion, and erythropoietin may be used. 
- Renal failure: rehydrate, and ensure adequate fluid intake of 3L/day to prevent further light chain-induced renal impairment. Dialysis may be needed in acute kidney injury. 
- Infections: Treat rapidly with broad-spectrum antibiotics until culture results are known. Regular IV immunoglobulin infusions may be needed if recurrent.

**Chemotherapy:** Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. In suitably fit patients this may be followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation. In those unsuitable for transplantation, induction therapy is typically continued for 12-18 months, or until serum paraprotein levels have plateaued. Treatment is then typically held until (inevitably) paraprotein levels start to rise again, at which point further chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be considered. NB: lenalidomide is a teratogenic immunomodulator which has multiple SE, notably neutropenia and thromboembolism: monitor for sepsis and consider aspirin or anticoagulation if risk ↑, eg hyperviscosity or other comorbidities.

## Prognosis
Worse if: >2 osteolytic lesions, β₂-microglobulin >5.5mg/L, Hb <11g/L; albumin <30g/L. Risk stratification increasingly based upon detection of specific cytogenetic abnormalities associated with high risk of progression. Causes of death: infection, renal failure.
