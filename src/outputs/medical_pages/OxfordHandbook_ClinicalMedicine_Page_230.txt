# 216 Thyroid function tests (TFTs)

## Physiology

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH=thyrotropin), a glycoprotein, is produced from the anterior pituitary (fig 5.12). The thyroid produces mainly T4, which is 5-fold less active than T3. 85% of T3 is formed from peripheral conversion of T4. Most T3 and T4 in plasma is protein bound, eg to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). The unbound portion is the active part. T3 and T4 cell metabolism, via nuclear receptors, and are thus vital for growth and mental development. They also catecholamine effects. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are usually due to problems in the thyroid gland itself, and rarely caused by the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary.

## Basic tests
See table 5.2. Free T4 and T3 are more useful than total T4 and T3 as the latter are affected by TBG. Total T4 and T3 are ↑ when TBG is ↑ and vice versa. TBG is ↑ in pregnancy, oestrogen therapy (HRT, oral contraceptives), and hepatitis. TBG is ↓ in nephrotic syndrome and malnutrition (both from protein loss), drugs (androgens, corticosteroids, phenytoin), chronic liver disease, and acromegaly. TSH is very useful:

- Hyperthyroidism suspected: Ask for T3, T4, and TSH. All will have ↓TSH (except the rare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma). Most have ↑T4, but ~1% have only raised T3.
- Hypothyroidism suspected or monitoring replacement ℞: Ask for only T4 and TSH. T3 does not add any extra information. TSH varies through the day: trough at 2PM; 30% higher during darkness, so during monitoring, try to do at the same time.

Sick euthyroidism: In any systemic illness, TFTs may become deranged. The typical pattern is for 'everything to be low'. The test should be repeated after recovery.

Assay interference is caused by antibodies in the serum, interfering with the test.

## Other tests

- Thyroid autoantibodies: Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO; formerly called microsomal) antibodies or antithyroglobulin antibodies may be increased in autoimmune thyroid disease: Hashimoto's or Graves' disease. If +ve in Graves', there is an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism at a later stage.
- TSH receptor antibody: May be ↑ in Graves' disease (useful in pregnancy).
- Serum thyroglobulin: Useful in monitoring the treatment of carcinoma (p600), and in detection of factitious (self-medicated) hyperthyroidism, where it is low.
- Ultrasound: This distinguishes cystic (usually, but not always, benign) from solid (possibly malignant) nodules. If a solitary (or dominant) large nodule, in a multinodular goitre, do a fine-needle aspiration to look for thyroid cancer; see fig 13.23, p601.
- Isotope scan: (123Iodine, 99technetium pertechnetate, etc; see fig 13.22, p601.) Useful for determining the cause of hyperthyroidism and to detect retrosternal goitre, ectopic thyroid tissue or thyroid metastases (+ whole body CT). If there are suspicious nodules, the question is: does the area have increased (hot), decreased (cold), or the same (neutral) uptake of isotope as the remaining thyroid (see fig 5.13). Few neutral and almost no hot nodules are malignant. 20% of 'cold' nodules are malignant. Surgery is most likely to be needed if: •rapid growth •compression signs •dominant nodule on scintigraphy •nodule ≥3cm •hypo-echogenicity. See also p738.
