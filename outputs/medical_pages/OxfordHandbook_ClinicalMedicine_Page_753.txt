## Renal function
Chromium-51 ($$^{51}\text{Cr}$$) EDTA or DTPA ($$^{99m}\text{Tc}$$, p669) is used to assess GFR. $$^{99m}\text{Tc}$$-mercapto-acetyltriglycine (MAG3) technique assesses relative (left-right) renal function and renal transit time (eg in renovascular disease). $$^{99m}\text{Tc}$$-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning (fig 16.28) is the gold standard for evaluation of renal scarring that occurs, eg in reflux nephropathy.

## Positron emission tomography (PET)
One of the key investigations in malignancy, but also has a wide range of other uses. If the tracer chosen is $$^{18}\text{F}$$-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a short half-life glucose analogue, it becomes concentrated in metabolically active tissues. FDG decays rapidly to produce a positron that, after travelling a few millimetres through tissue, annihilates with an electron to produce a pair of high-energy photons (gamma rays), which PET detects. Normal high uptake of FDG occurs in brain, liver, kidney, bladder, larynx, and lymphoid tissue of pharynx and must be considered when assessing images. Neoplasms have high uptake of FDG with hotspots suggesting primary disease or metastases. Since inflammatory lesions will also show high uptake, there is a risk of false-positive results (eg sarcoid, TB); diagnosis must be confirmed with histology of suspicious lesions. PET allows staging of many solid organ malignancies (lung, melanoma, oesophageal) as well as lymphomas, and is particularly useful for planning of radiotherapy and surgery for both primary disease and metastases. PET can also be used to image occult sources of infection. PET can be combined with CT or MRI to provide high-quality images combining anatomy with physiology. A range of alternative tracers are now entering clinical use with radiotracers conjugated to other tissue-specific substrates (eg $$^{11}\text{C}$$-labelled metomidate to detect tumors of adrenocortical origin, somatostatin tracers in neuroendocrine tumours, and amyloid tracers in Alzheimer's disease).

## Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
Similar to PET but rather than using positron emission, it uses a radioisotope-labelled molecule as per conventional nuclear imaging, but with two gamma cameras for detection. The images produced are of lower resolution than PET but the isotopes used are longer lived and more easily available. Examples include myocardial perfusion scanning (p741).
