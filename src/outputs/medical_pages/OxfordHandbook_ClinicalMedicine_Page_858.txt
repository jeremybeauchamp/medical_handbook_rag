# Paracetamol poisoning

12g (=24 tablets) or 150mg/kg in adults may be fatal. ▶If the patient weighs >110kg, calculate ingested dose using a body weight of 110kg to avoid underestimating toxicity. If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill.

**Signs and symptoms** None initially, or vomiting ± RUQ pain. Later: jaundice and encephalopathy from liver damage (the main danger) ± acute kidney injury (AKI).

**Management** General measures: See p838. GI decontamination is recommended in those presenting <4h after overdose: give activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g).

- Glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, HCO3⁻; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion.
- If <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line on the graph (see fig 19.26), start acetylcysteine.
- If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and start acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal.
- If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from ingestion, treatment may still help. ▶Get advice.

Acetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/kg in 500mL of 5% glucose over 4h; then 100mg/kg/16h in 1L of 5% glucose. Rash is a common SE: treat with chlorphenamine + observe; do not stop unless anaphylatoid reaction with shock, vomiting, and wheeze (occur <10%). An alternative (if acetylcysteine unavailable) is methionine 2.5g/4h PO for 16h (total: 10g), but absorption is unreliable if vomiting.

**Ongoing management**
- Next day do INR, U&E, LFT. If INR rising, continue acetylcysteine until <1.4.
- If continued deterioration, discuss with the liver team. Don't hesitate to get help.
- Consider referral to specialist liver unit guided by eg King's College criteria (BOX, p275).

# Salicylate poisoning

Aspirin is a weak acid with poor water solubility. It is present in many over-the-counter preparations. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to anaerobic metabolism and the production of lactate and heat. Effects are dose related and potentially fatal: •150mg/kg: mild toxicity. •250mg/kg: moderate •>500mg/kg: severe toxicity. Levels over 700mg/L are potentially fatal.

**Signs and symptoms** Unlike paracetamol, there are many early features:
- Vomiting, dehydration, hyperventilation, tinnitus, vertigo, sweating.
- Rarely ↓GCS, seizures, ↓BP and heart block, pulmonary oedema, hyperthermia.
Patients present initially with respiratory alkalosis due to a direct stimulation of the central respiratory centres and then develop a metabolic acidosis. Hyper- or hypoglycaemia may occur.

**Management** General: (pp838–9.) Correct dehydration. Keep patient on ECG monitor. Give activated charcoal to all presenting ≤1h—consider even if delayed presentation, slow-release formations, or bezoar formation (can delay absorption): at least one dose of 1g/kg (max 50g). Consider repeat doses (two further doses of 50g, 4h apart).

1. **Bloods.** Paracetamol and salicylate level, glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, HCO3⁻, FBC. Salicylate level may need to be repeated after 2h, due to continuing absorption if a potentially toxic dose has been taken. Monitor blood glucose 1–2hrly, beware hypoglycaemia, if severe poisoning, monitor salicylate levels, serum pH, and U&E.

2. **Urine.** Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH.

3. **Correct acidosis.** If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe metabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L 1.26% sodium bicarbonate IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5–8. NB: monitor serum K⁺ as hypokalaemia may occur, and should be treated (caution if AKI).

4. **Dialysis** may well be needed if salicylate level >700mg/L, and if AKI or heart failure, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, confusion or seizures, severe acidosis despite best medical therapy, or persistently ↑plasma salicylate. Contact nephrology early.
