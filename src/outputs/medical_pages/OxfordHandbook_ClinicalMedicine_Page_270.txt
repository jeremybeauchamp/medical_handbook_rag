# Upper gastrointestinal bleeding

Haematemesis is vomiting of blood. It may be bright red or look like coffee grounds.
Melaena (Greek melas = black) means black motions, often like tar, and has a characteristic smell of altered blood. Both indicate upper GI bleeding.

Take a brief history and examine to assess severity. Ask about past GI bleeds; dyspepsia/known ulcers; known liver disease or oesophageal varices (p257); dysphagia; vomiting; weight loss. Check drugs (see BOX on common and rare causes) and alcohol use. Is there serious co-morbidity (bad prognosis), eg cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, hepatic or renal impairment, or malignancy? Look for signs of chronic liver disease (p276) and do a PR to check for melaena. Is the patient shocked? Also:

| Common causes | Rare causes |
|----------------|-------------|
| • Peptic ulcers | • Bleeding disorders |
| • Mallory-Weiss tear | • Portal hypertensive |
| • Oesophageal varices | gastropathy |
| • Gastritis/gastric erosions | • Aorto-enteric fistula¹⁰ |
| • Drugs (NSAIDs, aspirin, | • Angiodysplasia |
| steroids, thrombolytics, | • Haemobilia |
| anticoagulants) | • Dieulafoy lesion¹¹ |
| • Oesophagitis | • Meckel's diverticulum |
| • Duodenitis | • Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome |
| • Malignancy | • Osler-Weber-Rendu |
| • No obvious cause | syndrome. |

• Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refill time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h.
• GCS (tricky to assess in decompensated liver disease) or encephalopathy (p275).
• Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm).
• Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg.
• Calculate the Rockall score (tables 6.6, 6.7).

## Acute management (p820.) 
Skill in resuscitation determines survival, so get good at this! Summary:⁵ start by protecting the airway and giving high-flow O₂, then:

- Insert 2 large-bore (14-16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC (early Hb may be normal because haemodilution has not yet taken place), U&E (urea out of proportion to creatinine indicative of massive blood meal), LFT, clotting, and crossmatch.
- Give IV fluids (p821) to restore intravascular volume while waiting for cross-matched blood. If haemodynamically deteriorating despite fluid resuscitation, give group O Rh-ve blood. Avoid saline if cirrhotic/varices.
- Insert a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.
- Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.
- Consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fluid replacement.
- Transfuse (with crossmatched blood if needed) if significant Hb drop (<70g/L).
- Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).
- If suspicion of varices then give terlipressin IV eg 1-2mg/6h for ≤3d; relative risk of death ↓ by 34%.Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotic cover.
- Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH₂O) at least hourly until stable.
- Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).
- If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/ embolization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by someone with experience.

## Further management 
Anatomy is important in assessing risk of rebleeding. Posterior DUs are highest risk as they are nearest to the gastroduodenal artery.

• Re-examine after 4h and consider the need for FFP if >4 units transfused.
• Hourly pulse, BP, CVP, urine output (4hrly if haemodynamically stable may be OK).
• Transfuse to keep Hb >70g/L; ensure a current valid group & save sample.
• Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and clotting daily.
• Keep nil by mouth if at high rebleed risk (see BOX 'Management of peptic ulcer bleeds' and p256)—ask the endoscopist.

10 A patient with an aortic graft repair and upper GI bleeding is considered to have an aorto-enteric fistula until proven otherwise: CT abdomen is usually required as well as endoscopy.
11 A Dieulafoy lesion is the rupture of an unusually big arteriole, eg in the fundus of the stomach.
