## Symptoms

Symptoms are features which patients report. Physical signs are elicited at the bedside. Together, they constitute the features of the condition in that patient. Their evolution over time and interaction with the physical, psychological, and social spheres comprise the natural history of any disease. Throughout this chapter, we discuss symptoms in isolation and attempt to classify them into a 'system' or present them in the following BOXES as 'non-specific'. This is unnatural but a good first step in learning how to diagnose. All doctors have to know about symptoms and their relief. Part of becoming a good doctor is learning to link symptoms together, to identify those that may be normal, and those that are worrying. There are many online tools and books that can help with this, but there is no substitute for experience. If you aren't sure, ask a specialist in that area for advice.

The following are common 'non-specific' presentations.

### Itch

Itching (pruritus) Common and, if chronic, most unpleasant.

| Local causes | Systemic (do FBC, ESR, glucose, LFT, U&E, ferritin, TFT) |  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Eczema, atopy, urticaria | Liver disease (bile salts, eg PBC) | Old age; pregnancy |
| Scabies | Uraemia (eg CKD) | Drugs (eg morphine) |
| Lichen planus | Malignancy (eg lymphoma) | Diabetes mellitus |
| Dermatitis herpetiformis | Polycythaemia rubra vera | Thyroid disease |
| Spinal cord tumours (rare)* | Iron deficiency anaemia | HIV infection |

Questions: Wheals (urticaria)? Worse at night? Others affected (scabies)? What provokes it? After a bath ≈ polycythaemia rubra vera (p366). Exposure, eg to animals (atopy?) or fibre glass (irritant eczema?).

See table 2.1. Look for local causes: Scabies burrows in finger webs, lice on hair shafts, knee and elbow blisters (dermatitis herpetiformis). Systemic: Splenomegaly, nodes, jaundice, flushed face, or thyroid signs? ℞ Treat causes; try soothing bland emollients ± emollient bath oils ± sedative antihistamines at night, eg chlorphenamine 4mg PO.

### 'Off-legs'—falls and difficulty walking

Common causes of admission in the elderly, and can lead to loss of confidence and independence. Causes are often multifactorial:

Intrinsic: Typically osteo- or rheumatoid arthritis, but remember fractured neck of femur, CNS disease, ↓ vision, cognitive impairment, depression, postural hypotension, peripheral neuropathy, medication (eg antihypertensives, sedatives), pain, eg arthritis, parkinsonism (eg drugs: prochlorperazine, neuroleptics, metoclopramide), muscle weakness (consider vitamin D deficiency), incontinence, UTI, pneumonia, anaemia, hypothyroidism, renal impairment, hypothermia, and alcohol.

Environment: Poor lighting, uneven walking surface. Treatment includes addressing injuries, reducing risk factors, and reducing the risk of injury, eg treat osteoporosis (p682). A multidisciplinary multifactorial approach alongside occupational therapists and physiotherapists is likely to be beneficial. See gait disorders, p467.

If there is ataxia, the cause is not always alcohol: other chemicals may be involved (eg cannabis or prescribed sedatives). There may be a metastatic or non-metastatic manifestation of malignancy, or a cerebellar lesion.

▶Bilateral weak legs may suggest a cord lesion: see p466. If there is associated urinary or faecal incontinence ± saddle anaesthesia or lower limb sensory loss, urgent imaging (MRI) and treatment for cord compression may well be needed.
