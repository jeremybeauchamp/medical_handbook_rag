## Hypertension

Hypertension[44] is the most important risk factor for premature death and CVD; causing ~50% of all vascular deaths (8×10⁶/yr). Usually asymptomatic, so regular screening (eg 3-yrly) is a vital task—most preventable deaths are in areas without universal screening.[45]

### Defining hypertension
BP has a skewed normal distribution (p751) within the population, and risk is continuously related to BP, so it is impossible to define 'hypertension'.[46] We choose to select a value above which risk is significantly increased and the benefit of treatment is clear cut, see below. Don't rely on a single reading—assess over a period of time (how long depends on the BP and the presence of other risk factors or end-organ damage). Confirm with 24hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM); or a week of home readings. NB: the diagnostic threshold is lower ~135/85mmHg.

### Whom to treat
All with BP ≥160/100mmHg (or ABPM ≥150/95mmHg). For those ≥140/90, the decision depends on the risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes, or end-organ damage; see fig 3.40.[44] The HYVET study showed that there is even substantial benefit in treating the over-80s.[47] Lower thresholds may be appropriate for young people—BP is on average lower in young people (eg 100–110/60–70 in 18-year-olds) and they have a 'lifetime' of risk ahead of them; but evidence to treat is lacking.

### White-coat hypertension
Refers to an elevated clinic pressure, but normal ABPM (day average <135/85). NICE says don't treat; but more likely to develop hypertension in future, and may have risk of CVD. Masked hypertension is the opposite.

### 'Malignant' or accelerated phase hypertension
A rapid rise in BP leading to vascular damage (pathological hallmark is fibrinoid necrosis). Usually there is severe hypertension (eg systolic >200, diastolic>130mmHg) + bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates; papilloedema may or may not be present. Symptoms are common, eg headache ± visual disturbance. It requires urgent treatment, and may also precipitate acute kidney injury, heart failure, or encephalopathy, which are hypertensive emergencies. Untreated, 90% die in 1yr; treated, 70% survive 5yrs. It is more common in younger and in black subjects. Look hard for any underlying cause.

### Primary or 'essential' hypertension
(Cause unknown.) ~95% of cases.

### Secondary hypertension
~5% of cases. Causes include:

- **Renal disease**: the most common secondary cause. 75% are from intrinsic renal disease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, or polycystic kidneys. 25% are due to renovascular disease, most frequently atheromatous (elderly ♂ cigarette smokers, eg with peripheral vascular disease) or rarely fibromuscular dysplasia (young ♀).
- **Endocrine disease**: Cushing's (p224) and Conn's syndromes (p228), phaeochromocytoma (p228), acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism.
- **Others**: coarctation (p156), pregnancy (OHCS p48), liquorice, drugs: steroids, MAOI, oral contraceptive pill, cocaine, amphetamines.

### Signs and symptoms
Usually asymptomatic (except malignant hypertension, see earlier in topic). Headache is no more common than in the general population. Always examine the CVS fully and check for retinopathy. Are there features of an underlying cause (phaeochromocytoma, p228, etc.), signs of renal disease, radiofemoral delay, or weak femoral pulses (coarctation), renal bruits, palpable kidneys, or Cushing's syndrome? Look for end-organ damage: LVH, retinopathy and proteinuria—indicates severity and duration of hypertension and associated with a poorer prognosis.

### Tests
**To confirm diagnosis**: ABPM or home BP monitoring. **To help quantify overall risk**: Fasting glucose; cholesterol. **To look for end-organ damage**: ECG or echo (any LV hypertrophy? past MI?); urine analysis (protein, blood). **To 'exclude' secondary causes**: U&E (eg K+ in Conn's); Ca²+ (↑ in hyperparathyroidism). **Special tests**: Renal ultrasound/arteriography (renal artery stenosis); 24h urinary meta-adrenaline (p228); urinary free cortisol (p225); renin; aldosterone; MR aorta (coarctation).
