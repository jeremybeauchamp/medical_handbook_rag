# Lung tumours

## Carcinoma of the bronchus
Second most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 13% of all new cancer cases and 27% of cancer deaths (40 000 cases/yr in UK). Incidence is increasing in women. Only 5% 'cured'. 

**Risk factors:** Cigarette smoking (causes 90% of lung ca). Others: passive smoking, asbestos, chromium, arsenic, iron oxides, and radiation (radon gas).

**Histology:** Clinically the most important division is between small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC). NSCLC: Squamous (35%); adenocarcinoma (27%), large cell (10%); adenocarcinoma in situ (rare, <1%). Small cell (oat cell) (20%): Arise from endocrine cells (Kulchitsky cells), often secreting polypeptide hormones resulting in paraneoplastic syndromes (eg production of ACTH, Cushing's syndrome). Most (70%) SCLC are disseminated at presentation.

**Symptoms:** Cough (80%); haemoptysis (70%); dyspnoea (60%); chest pain (40%); recurrent or slowly resolving pneumonia; lethargy, anorexia; weight loss.

**Signs:** Cachexia; anaemia; clubbing; HPOA (hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, causing wrist pain); supraclavicular or axillary nodes. Chest signs: none, or consolidation; collapse; pleural effusion. Metastases: bone tenderness; hepatomegaly; confusion; fits; focal CNS signs; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy; peripheral neuropathy.

**Complications:** 
- Local: recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; phrenic nerve palsy; SVC obstruction; Horner's syndrome (Pancoast's tumour); rib erosion; pericarditis; AF. 
- Metastatic: brain; bone (bone pain, anaemia, ↑Ca²⁺); liver; adrenals (Addison's). 
- Non-metastatic neurological: confusion; fits; cerebellar syndrome; proximal myopathy; neuropathy; polymyositis; Lambert-Eaton syndrome (p512). See table 4.3.

**Tests:** 
- CXR: peripheral nodule (fig 4.8); hilar enlargement; consolidation; lung collapse; pleural effusion; bony secondaries. 
- Cytology: sputum and pleural fluid (send at least 20mL). 
- Fine needle aspiration or biopsy (peripheral lesions/lymph nodes).
- CT to stage the tumour (p176) and guide bronchoscopy. 
- Bronchoscopy: to give histology and assess operability, ± endobronchial ultrasound for assessment and biopsy.
- ¹⁸F-deoxyglucose PET or PET/CT EBUS scan to help in staging. 
- Radionuclide bone scan: if suspected metastases. 
- Lung function tests: help assess suitability for lobectomy.

## Other lung tumours
**Bronchial adenoma:** Rare, slow-growing. 90% are carcinoid tumours; 10% cylindromas. ℞: surgery. 

**Hamartoma:** Rare, benign; CT: lobulated mass ± flecks of calcification; ?excise to exclude malignancy.

## Malignant mesothelioma
A tumour of mesothelial cells that usually occurs in the pleura, and rarely in the peritoneum or other organs. It is associated with occupational exposure to asbestos but the relationship is complex. 90% report previous exposure to asbestos, but only 20% of patients have pulmonary asbestosis. The latent period between exposure and development of the tumour may be up to 45yrs. Compensation is often available.

**Clinical features:** Chest pain, dyspnoea, weight loss, finger clubbing, recurrent pleural effusions. Signs of metastases: lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, bone pain/tenderness, abdominal pain/obstruction (peritoneal malignant mesothelioma).

**Tests:** CXR/CT: pleural thickening/effusion. Bloody pleural fluid.

**Diagnosis:** Made on histology, usually following a thoracoscopy. Often the diagnosis is only made post-mortem.

**Management:** Pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy can improve survival. Surgery is hard to evaluate (few randomized trials). Radiotherapy is controversial. Pleurodesis and indwelling intra-pleural drain may help.

**Prognosis:** Poor (especially without pemetrexed, eg <2yrs). >650 deaths/yr in UK.
