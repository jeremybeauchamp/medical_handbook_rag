CKD bone-mineral disorders: CKD causes ↑ in serum phosphate and reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D by the kidney. Measure calcium, phosphate, ALP, PTH, and 25-OH vit D if eGFR <30.

• Treat if phosphate >1.5mmol/L (>1.7mmol/L if RRT) with dietary restriction ± phosphate binders. The use of binders which do not contain calcium may be beneficial in preventing vascular calcification.
• Give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if deficient. If PTH persists or is increasing, treat with an activated vit D analogue eg 1α-calcidol or calcitriol. Paricalcitol suppresses PTH with less effect on gut absorption of calcium and phosphate and is less likely to cause ↑calcium/phosphate.

Restless legs/cramps: Exclude iron deficiency as a possible exacerbating factor. Give sleep hygiene advice. Treatment for severe cases with gabapentin/pregabalin/dopamine agonists is off licence and may be complicated by side-effects (falls, cognitive impairment, impulse-control disorder).

Diet: Expert dietary advice should be available regarding protein intake, K+ if hyperkalaemic, and phosphate restriction (eg dairy products).

## Treatment of other complications of CKD

Cardiovascular disease: CKD confers ↑risk of cardiovascular disease due to ↑BP, vascular stiffness, inflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormal endothelial function (CV risk often higher than the risk of kidney failure).

• Antiplatelets (low-dose aspirin) for CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events unless bleeding risk outweighs benefit (mortality benefit unclear in CKD).
• Atorvastatin 20mg (and higher if GFR >30) for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
• CKD should not affect treatment for heart failure but ↑monitoring of GFR and K+.
• GFR <60 may affect troponin and BNP values. Interpret results cautiously with consideration for the GFR.

## Preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT)

Planning for RRT should begin in progressive CKD when the risk of renal failure is 10-20% within a year. Referral to nephrology less than 1 year before RRT is required is considered a late referral.

All suitable patients should be listed for a deceased donor transplantation 6 months before the anticipated start of RRT. All suitable patients should be informed about the advantages of a pre-emptive living kidney transplant and efforts made to find a donor (p308).

## Prescribing in CKD

> Never prescribe in renal failure before checking how administration should be altered due to a ↓GFR. This will be determined largely by the extent to which a drug is renally excreted. This is significant for aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalosporins, heparin, lithium, opiates, and digoxin. Loading doses should not be changed.

If precision is required for dosing (eg chemotherapy) then GFR should not be estimated from creatinine: a cystatin C or direct measure of GFR should be used.

If the patient is receiving renal replacement (haemofiltration, peritoneal or haemodialysis), dose modification depends on the extent to which a drug is cleared from the circulation by dialysis/filtration.

The best prescribing guide to consult is the Renal Drug Database/Handbook (www.renaldrugdatabase.com), an invaluable resource detailing dose modification in renal failure and in renal replacement for almost any drug you could wish to use. All hospitals should have access: speak to your pharmacist.
