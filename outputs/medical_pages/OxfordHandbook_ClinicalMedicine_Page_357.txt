# Structure of haemoglobin

## Table 8.2 The three main types of Hb in adult blood

| Type | Peptide chains | % in adult blood | % in fetal blood |
|------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| HbA  | α₂ β₂          | 97               | 10-50            |
| HbA₂ | α₂ δ₂          | 2.5              | Trace            |
| HbF  | α₂ γ₂          | 0.5              | 50-90            |

Adult haemoglobin (HbA) is a tetramer of 2 α- and 2 β-globin chains each containing a haem group. In the first year of life, adult haemoglobin replaces fetal haemoglobin (HbF).

It might be thought that because the molecular details of the thalassaemias are so well worked out they represent a perfect example of the reductionist principle at work: find out exactly what is happening within molecules, and you will be able to explain all the manifestations of a disease. But this is not so. We have to recognize that two people with the identical mutation at their β loci may have quite different diseases. Co-inheritance of other genes and conditions (eg α thalassaemia) is part of the explanation, as is the efficiency of production of fetal haemoglobin. The reasons lie beyond simple co-segregation of genes promoting the formation of fetal Hb. The rate of proteolysis of excess α-globin chains may also be important—as may mechanisms that have little to do with genetic or molecular events.

## Fig 8.41 α thalassaemia showing Mexican hat cells (also called target cells)—one of which is arrowed on the left panel. Note also the tear-drop cell on the right panel, and the 2 normoblasts (nucleated red cells, one on each panel). The shorter arrow on the left panel points to a Howell-Jolly body. Note that the cells which are not Mexican hats are rather small (microcytic). There is also poikilocytosis (poikilos is Greek for varied—so this simply means that the red blood cells are of varied shape).
