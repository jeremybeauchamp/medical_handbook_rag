# Multiple sclerosis (MS)

Inflammatory plaques of demyelination in the CNS disseminated in space and time; ie occurring at multiple sites, with ≥30d in between attacks. Demyelination heals poorly, eventually causing axonal loss; >80% of patients develop progressive disability. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown; it is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is >30% concordance in identical twins, and unusual geographical distribution, with increasing incidence with latitude in some parts of the world (NB: adult migrants take their risk with them; children acquire the risk of where they settle)—leading to hypotheses of the roles of vitamin D and infection. Mean age of onset is 30yrs. ♀:♂ ≥3:1.

## Presentation
Usually monosymptomatic: ~20% present with unilateral optic neuritis (pain on eye movement and rapid central vision). Corticospinal tract and bladder involvement are also common, and symptoms may worsen with heat (eg hot bath or exercise). Other symptoms/signs see table 10.8.

## Diagnosis
This is clinical, made by a consultant neurologist using established criteria (eg McDonald, see table 10.9) and after alternative diagnoses have been excluded.
> Early diagnosis and treatment reduce relapse rates and disability so refer to neurology as soon as MS is suspected.

## Tests
Depending on presenting symptoms, some patients may need extra supporting information to make a diagnosis (as per the McDonald criteria). MRI: Sensitive but not specific for plaque detection. It may also exclude other causes, eg cord compression. CSF: Oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis that are not present in serum suggest CNS inflammation. Delayed visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials.

## Progression
Most patients follow a relapsing-remitting course, with initial recovery in between relapses. With time, remission becomes incomplete, so disability accumulates (secondary progression). 10% of patients display steadily progressive disability in the absence of relapses (primary progressive MS), while a minority of patients experience no progressive disablement at all. Poor prognostic signs: Older ♂; motor signs at onset; many early relapses; many MRI lesions; axonal loss. Pregnancy: Does not alter the rate of progression: relapses may reduce during pregnancy and increase 3–6 months afterwards, but return to their previous rate thereafter.

## Management
As with all neurological conditions, requires the coordinated care of a multidisciplinary team and full involvement of the patient in all decisions.

### Lifestyle advice:
Regular exercise, stopping smoking and avoiding stress may help.

### Disease-modifying drugs:
Dimethyl fumarate is an option for mild/moderate relapsing-remitting MS. The monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab (acts against T cells) and natalizumab (acts against VLA-4 receptors that allow immune cells to cross the blood–brain barrier) are also approved for relapsing-remitting disease. Interferon beta and glatiramer are not recommended by NICE on the balance of clinical and cost-effectiveness. Azathioprine is not recommended due to its SE profile.

### Treating relapses:
Methylprednisolone, eg 0.5–1g/24h IV/PO for 3–5d shortens acute relapses; use sparingly (≤ twice/yr; steroid SE, p377). It doesn't alter overall prognosis.

### Symptom control:
- Spasticity: offer baclofen or gabapentin. Tizanidine or dantrolene are 2nd line; if these fail consider benzodiazepines.
- Tremor: botulinum toxin type A injections improve arm tremor and functioning.
- Urgency/frequency: if post-micturition residual urine >100mL, teach intermittent self-catheterization; if <100mL, try tolterodine.
- Fatigue: amantadine, CBT, and exercise may help.
