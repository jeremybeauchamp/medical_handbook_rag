# Prophylactic antibiotics in surgery

Prophylactic antibiotics are given to counter the risk of wound infection (see table 13.1), which occurs in ~20% of elective GI surgery (up to 60% in emergency surgery). Antibiotics are also given if infection elsewhere, although unlikely, would have severe consequences (eg when prostheses are involved). A single dose given before surgery has been shown to be just as good as more prolonged regimens in biliary and colorectal surgery. Additional doses may be given if high-risk/prolonged procedures, or if major blood loss. Wound infections are not necessarily trivial since sepsis may lead to haemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and initiate a fatal chain of events, so take measures to minimize the risk of wound infection:

- Time administration correctly (eg IV prophylaxis should be given 30min prior to surgery to maximize skin concentration; metronidazole PR is given 2h before).
- Use antibiotics which will kill anaerobes and coliforms.
- Consider use of peri-operative supplemental oxygen. This is a practical method of reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections.
- Practise strictly sterile surgical technique. (Ask for a hand with scrubbing up if you are not sureâ€”theatre staff will be more than pleased to help!)

## Antibiotic regimens
Adhere to local guidelines. BNF examples include:

- **Appendicectomy; colorectal resections and open biliary surgery:** A single dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h or gentamicin 1.5mg/kg + metronidazole 500mg or co-amoxiclav 1.2g alone.
- **Oesophageal or gastric surgery:** 1 dose of IV gentamicin or piperacillin/tazobactam or co-amoxiclav (doses as for appendicectomy).
- **Vascular surgery:** 1 dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam or flucloxacillin 1-2g + gentamicin. Add metronidazole if risk of anaerobes (eg amputations, gangrene, or diabetes).
- **MRSA:** For high-risk patients add teicoplanin or vancomycin to the above-listed regimens.

### Table 13.1 Classification of surgical procedures and wound infection risk

| Category | Description | Infection risk |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Clean | Incising uninfected skin without opening a viscus | <2% |
| Clean-contaminated | Intra-operative breach of a viscus (but not colon) | 8-10% |
| Contaminated | Breach of a viscus + spillage or opening of colon | 12-20% |
| Dirty | The site is already contaminated with pus or faeces, or from exogenous contagion, eg trauma | 25% |
