# The pregnant woman

Pre-existing conditions and non-obstetric disease cause more maternal deaths in the UK than obstetric complications.

Pregnant women should receive the same investigations and treatment as non-pregnant patients, with avoidance of harm/potential harm to the fetus whenever possible.

Most mistakes made in the medical management of pregnant women are due to acts of omission caused by inappropriate weighting of risk and benefit.

## Physiological changes in pregnancy

Clinical assessment in pregnancy requires knowledge of the physiological changes associated with the gravid state. Expected changes and guidance on when to investigate for possible underlying pathology is given in table 1.3.

### Table 1.3 Physiology and pathology in pregnancy

| System         | Normal pregnancy                  | Consider pathology                                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Cardiovascular | ↓BP before 20 weeks' gestation    | Diastolic BP >80mmHg in 1st trimester                 |
|                | ↑Heart rate                       | Sustained tachycardia >100/min                        |
| Respiratory    | Compensated respiratory alkalosis | Serum bicarbonate <18mmol/L                           |
|                | No change in PEFR                 | Decrease in PEFR                                      |
|                | ↑Respiratory rate by 10%          | Respiratory rate >20/min                              |
| Renal          | ↑GFR and creatinine clearance     | Creatinine >85μmol/L (eGFR not valid in pregnancy)    |
|                | ↑Protein excretion                | Protein:creatinine ratio >30mg/mmol                   |
| Endocrine      | Altered glucose handling          | Fasting glucose >5.0mmol/L                            |
| Haematology    | Haemodilution                     | Hb <10.5g/dL, platelets <100x10⁹/L                    |

## Radiology

If the uterus is positioned outside the imaging field of view, the radiation dose to the conceptus is minimal. Exposure from the following investigations is well below the threshold of risk to the fetus:

- Plain radiograph: chest, extremities, spine.
- CT: head, chest (but consider radiation to maternal breast in pregnancy/lactation).

Ultrasound and MRI are preferentially used when imaging the abdomen.

Reassure your pregnant patient that a chest x-ray is safe. It is the equivalent of 3 days of background radiation. Do not presume it is not required—how else will you pick up the widened mediastinum as a cause for her chest pain?

## Drugs

For drugs prescribed in pregnancy, benefit must be balanced against risk (table 1.4).
For information on drugs in lactation see: https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm.

### Table 1.4 Drugs in pregnancy

| Considered safe | Contraindicated |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Penicillins | Tetracycline/doxycycline |
| Macrolides | Ciprofloxacin |
| Low-molecular-weight heparin | Trimethoprim (1st trimester) |
| Aspirin | NSAIDs (3rd trimester) |
| Labetalol | ACE-i |
| Nifedipine | ARA |
| Adenosine | Mycophenolate |
| Prednisolone | Warfarin |
| Treatment for asthma: salbutamol, ipratropium, aminophylline, leukotriene antagonists | Live vaccines (MMR, BCG, Varicella) |

## Sepsis

Do not underestimate sepsis in pregnancy. Septic shock can be rapid. Do not ignore tachypnoea. All pregnant women should receive the influenza vaccine.
