## Chronic kidney disease (CKD): management

CKD encompasses a range of disease from mild disease without progression to advanced, symptomatic disease requiring renal replacement.

Management of CKD requires:
1. Appropriate referral to nephrology.
2. Treatment to slow renal disease progression.
3. Treatment of renal complications of CKD.
4. Treatment of other complications of CKD.
5. Preparation for renal replacement therapy (dialysis/transplantation) (p306).

### Referral to nephrology
Consider referral for:
- stage G4 and G5 CKD (table 7.5)
- moderate proteinuria A:CR >70mg/mmol unless due to DM and already treated
- proteinuria A:CR >30mg/mmol with haematuria
- declining eGFR:
  - ↓eGFR by ≥25% + ↓GFR category (table 7.5)
  - sustained ↓eGFR ≥15% within 12 months
- BP poorly controlled despite ≥4 antihypertensive drugs at therapeutic dose
- known or suspected rare or genetic cause of CKD.

### Treatment to slow renal disease progression
BP: Target systolic BP is <140mmHg (range 120-139mmHg) and diastolic <90mmHg. If DM or ACR >70 then systolic target is <130mmHg (range 120-129) and diastolic <80mmHg.

Renin-angiotensin system: Offer treatment with a renin-angiotensin system antagonist (ACE-i, ARB) to:
- DM and A:CR >3mg/mmol.
- Hypertension and A:CR >30mg/mmol.
- Any CKD with A:CR >70mg/mmol.

Do not combine renin-angiotensinsin antagonists due to risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension. Check K+ and renal function prior to, and 1-2 weeks after, starting treatment or changing dose. Stop if K+ >6mmol/L, ↓eGFR >25%, or ↑creatinine >30%: exclude other possible causes and consider a lower dose.

Glycaemic control: Target HbA1C of ~53mmol/mol (7.0%) unless risk of hypoglycaemia, comorbidity or limited life expectancy.

Lifestyle: Offer advice about exercise, healthy weight, and smoking cessation. Salt intake should be reduced to <2g of sodium/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day).

### Treatment of renal complications of CKD
Anaemia: Check Hb when eGFR <60. Investigate (especially if anaemic with eGFR >30) and treat other deficiencies: iron (hypochromic red cells >6%, transferrin saturation <20%, ferritin <100), B12, and folate. Do not miss chronic blood loss. Iron therapy may need to be given IV. Consider treatment with an erythropoietic stimulating agent (ESA, 'Epo') if Hb <110g/L and likely to benefit in terms of function and quality of life. Pure red cell aplasia is a very rare, severe complication of ESA treatment due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60g/L: exclude more common causes of anaemia first.

Acidosis: Consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for patients with eGFR <30 and low serum bicarbonate (<20mmol/L). Caution in patients with hypertension and fluid overload due to sodium component.

Oedema: Restrict fluid and sodium intake. High doses of loop diuretics may be needed. Combination of a loop and thiazide diuretic can have a powerful effect: distal tubule sodium excretion (and its inhibition with a thiazide) is more significant when already treated with a loop diuretic (fig 7.13). Diuretic treatment should only be given with careful monitoring of fluid state and renal function.
