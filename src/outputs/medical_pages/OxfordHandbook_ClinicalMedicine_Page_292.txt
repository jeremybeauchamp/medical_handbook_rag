# Viral hepatitis

## Hepatitis A
RNA virus. Spread: Faecal-oral or shellfish. Endemic in Africa and S America, so a problem for travellers. Most infections are in childhood. Incubation: 2-6wks.

Symptoms: Fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, arthralgia—then: jaundice (rare in children), hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy. Tests: AST and ALT rise 22-40d after exposure (ALT may be >1000IU/L), returning to normal over 5-20wks. IgM rises from day 25 and means recent infection. IgG is detectable for life.

℞: Supportive. Avoid alcohol. Rarely, interferon alfa for fulminant hepatitis.

Active immunization: With inactivated viral protein. 1 IM dose gives immunity for 1yr (20yrs if further booster is given at 6-12 months).

Prognosis: Usually self-limiting. Fulminant hepatitis is rare. Chronicity doesn't occur.

## Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV, a DNA virus.) Spread: Blood products, IV drug abusers (IVDU), sexual, direct contact. Deaths: 1 million/yr. Risk groups: IV drug users and their sexual partners/carers; health workers; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; haemodialysis (and chronic renal failure); sexually promiscuous; foster carers; close family members of a carrier or case; staff or residents of institutions/prisons; babies of HBsAg +ve mothers; adopted child from endemic area.

Endemic in: Far East, Africa, Mediterranean. Incubation: 1-6 months.

Signs: Resemble hepatitis A but arthralgia and urticaria are commoner.

Tests: HBsAg (surface antigen) is present 1-6 months after exposure. HBeAg (e antigen) is present for 1½-3 months after acute illness and implies high infectivity. HBsAg persisting for >6 months defines carrier status and occurs in 5-10% of infections; biopsy may be indicated unless ALT↔ and HBV DNA <2000iu/mL. Antibodies to HBcAg (anti-HBc) imply past infection; antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) alone imply vaccination. HBV PCR allows monitoring of response to therapy. See fig 6.29 and table 6.11. Vaccination: See p287. Passive immunization (specific anti-HBV immunoglobulin) may be given to non-immune contacts after high-risk exposure.

Complications: Fulminant hepatic failure, cirrhosis, HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, cryoglobulinaemia, membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa (p556).

℞: Avoid alcohol. Immunize sexual contacts. Refer all with chronic liver inflammation (eg ALT ≥30IU/L), cirrhosis, or HBV DNA >2000iu/mL for antivirals (choice is 48 wks pegylated (PEG) interferon alfa-2a vs long-term but better tolerated nucleos(t)ide analogues, eg tenofovir, entecavir). The aim is to clear HBsAg and ►prevent cirrhosis and HCC (risk is ↑↑ if HBsAg and HBeAg +ve).

## Hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) RNA flavivirus. Spread: Blood: transfusion, IV drug abuse, sexual contact. UK prevalence: >200 000. Early infection is often mild/asymptomatic. ~85% develop silent chronic infection; ~25% get cirrhosis in 20yrs—of these, ≤4% get hepatocellular cancer (HCC)/yr. Risk factors for progression: Male, older, higher viral load, use of alcohol, HIV, HBV. Tests: LFT (AST:ALT <1:1 until cirrhosis develops, p276), anti-HCV antibodies confirms exposure; HCV-PCR confirms ongoing infection/chronicity; liver biopsy or non-invasive elastography if HCV-PCR +ve to assess liver damage and need for treatment. Determine HCV genotype (1-6).

℞: BOX; quit alcohol. Other complications: Glomerulonephritis; cryoglobulinaemia; thyroiditis; autoimmune hepatitis; PAN; polymyositis; porphyria cutanea tarda.

## Hepatitis D virus 
(HDV) Incomplete RNA virus (needs HBV for its assembly). HBV vaccination prevents HDV infection. 5% of HBV carriers have HDV co-infection. It may cause acute liver failure/cirrhosis. Tests: Anti-HDV antibody (only ask for it if HBsAg +ve). ℞: As interferon alfa has limited success, liver transplantation may be needed.

## Hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) RNA virus. Similar to HAV; common in Indochina (commoner in older men and also commoner than hepatitis A in UK); mortality is high in pregnancy. It is associated with pigs. Epidemics occur (eg Africa). Vaccine is available in China (not Europe). Δ Serology. ℞: Nil specific.

## Other infective causes of hepatitis 
EBV; CMV; leptospirosis; malaria; Q fever; syphilis; yellow fever.
