# Crystal arthropathies: gout

Gout[31] typically presents with an acute monoarthropathy with severe joint inflammation (fig 12.8). >50% occur at the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe (fig 12.12) (podagra). Other common joints are the ankle, foot, small joints of the hand, wrist, elbow, or knee. It can be polyarticular. It is caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and near joints. Attacks may be precipitated by trauma, surgery, starvation, infection, or diuretics. It is associated with raised plasma urate. In the long term, urate deposits (= tophi, eg in pinna, tendons, joints; see fig 12.9) and renal disease (stones, interstitial nephritis) may occur. Prevalence: ~1%. ♂:♀ ≈ 4:1.

## Differential diagnoses
Exclude septic arthritis in any acute monoarthropathy (p544). Then consider reactive arthritis, haemarthrosis, CPPD (see following topic) and palindromic RA (p546).

## Risk factors
**Reduced urate excretion:** Elderly, men, post-menopausal females, impaired renal function, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diuretics, antihypertensives, aspirin. **Excess urate production:** Dietary (alcohol, sweeteners, red meat, seafood), genetic disorders, myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis, tumour-lysis syndrome, drugs (eg alcohol, warfarin, cytotoxics). **Associations:** Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (see p680).[31] Gout is an independent risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular and renal disease. Screen for and treat CKD, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes.

## Investigations
Polarized light microscopy of synovial fluid shows negatively birefringent urate crystals (fig 12.10). Serum urate (SUA) is usually raised but may be normal.[32] Radiographs show only soft-tissue swelling in the early stages. Later, well-defined 'punched out' erosions are seen in juxta-articular bone (see fig 12.6 on p541). There is no sclerotic reaction, and joint spaces are preserved until late.

## Treatment of acute gout
High-dose NSAID (see BOX, p545) or if CI use colchicine (500mcg BD) which is effective but slower to work (BNF states max 6mg per course although rheumatologists will often use more).[33] NB: in renal impairment, NSAIDs and colchicine are problematic. Steroids (oral, IM, or intra-articular) may also be used.[34] Rest and elevate joint. Ice packs and 'bed cages' can be effective.

## Prevention
Lose weight, avoid prolonged fasts, alcohol excess, purine-rich meats, and low-dose aspirin. **Prophylaxis:** Start if >1 attack in 12 months, tophi, or renal stones. The aim is to ↓ attacks and prevent damage caused by crystal deposition. Use allopurinol and titrate from 100mg/24h, increasing every 4 weeks until plasma urate <0.3mmol/L (max 300mg/8h). SE: rash, fever, WCC. Allopurinol may trigger an attack so wait 3 weeks after an acute episode, and cover with regular NSAID (for up to 6 weeks) or colchicine (0.5mg/12h PO for up to 6 months). Avoid stopping allopurinol in acute attacks once established. Febuxostat (80mg/24h) is an alternative if allopurinol is CI or not tolerated. It ↓ uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase (SE: LFTs) and is more effective at reducing serum urate than allopurinol (number of acute attacks the same).[35] Uricosuric drugs ↑ urate excretion.

# Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD)

- **Acute CPPD crystal arthritis** Acute monoarthropathy usually of larger joints in elderly. Usually spontaneous but can be provoked by illness, surgery, or trauma.
- **Chronic CPPD** Inflammatory RA-like (symmetrical) polyarthritis and synovitis.
- **Osteoarthritis with CPPD** chronic polyarticular osteoarthritis with superimposed acute CPP attacks.

**Risk factors** Old age, hyperparathyroidism (see p222), haemochromatosis (see p288), hypophosphataemia (see p679). **Tests** Polarized light microscopy of synovial fluid shows weakly positively birefringent crystals (fig 12.11). It is associated with soft tissue calcium deposition on x-ray. **Management** Acute attacks: cool packs, rest, aspiration, and intra-articular steroids. NSAIDs (+PPI) ± colchicine 0.5-1.0mg/24h (used with caution) may prevent acute attacks. Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine may be considered for chronic CPP inflammatory arthritis.[36]
