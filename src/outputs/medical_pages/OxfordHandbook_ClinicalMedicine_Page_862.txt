# 848 Hypothermia

Have a high index of suspicion and a low-reading thermometer. Most patients are elderly and do not complain of, or feel, cold—so they have not tried to warm up. In the young, hypothermia is usually from cold exposure (eg near-drowning), or is secondary to impaired consciousness (eg following excess alcohol or drug overdose).

**Definition** Hypothermia implies a core (rectal) temperature <35°C.

**Causes** In the elderly, hypothermia is often caused by a combination of factors:
- Impaired homeostatic mechanisms: usually age-related.
- Low room temperature: poverty, poor housing.
- Impaired thermoregulation: pneumonia, MI, heart failure.
- Reduced metabolism: immobility, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus.
- Autonomic neuropathy (p505): eg diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's.
- Excess heat loss: psoriasis and any other widespread dermatological diseases (ie TEN/ erythrodermic eczema).
- Cold awareness: dementia, confusion.
- Increased exposure to cold: falls, especially at night when cold.
- Drugs: major tranquillizers, antidepressants, diuretics, alcohol.

**The patient**
- If the patient is shivering then the hypothermia is mild, if they are not shivering despite temp <35°C then the hypothermia is severe.
- Symptoms and signs include confusion, agitation, ↓GCS, coma, bradycardia, hypotension and arrhythmias (AF, VT, VF), especially if temp <30°C.

There are many stories of people 'returning to life' when warmed despite absence of vital signs, see BOX. It is essential to rewarm (see 'Treatment' later in topic) and re-examine.

**Diagnosis** Check oral or axillary T°. If ordinary thermometer shows <36.5°C, use a low-reading one PR. Is the rectal temperature <35°C? Infra-red ear thermometers can accurately reflect core temperature.

**Tests** Urgent U&E, plasma glucose, and amylase. Thyroid function tests; FBC; blood cultures. Consider blood gases. The ECG may show J-waves (fig 19.28).

**Treatment** Use ABCDE approach (p779)—but don't expose to cold.
- All patients should receive warm, humidified O₂; ventilate if comatose or respiratory insufficiency.
- Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of ½°C/h (check temperature, BP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min) using blankets or active external warming (hot air duvets). If T° rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid rewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. A falling BP can be a sign of too rapid warming.
- Warm IVI.
- Cardiac monitor is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming or on stimulation).
- Consider antibiotics for the prevention of pneumonia (p166). Give these routinely in patients over 65yrs with T° <32°C.
- Consider urinary catheter (to monitor renal function).

NB: In sudden hypothermia from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovascular instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. Options include warmed fluid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal) and intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). In the event of cardiac arrest, defibrillation is usually unsuccessful if T° <30°C (consider amiodarone, bretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C (OHCS p786).

**Complications** Arrhythmias (if there is a cardiac arrest continue resuscitating until T° >33°C, as cold brains are less damaged by hypoxia); pneumonia; pancreatitis; AKI; DIC. **Prognosis:** Depends on age and degree of hypothermia. If age >70yrs and T° <32°C then mortality >50%.

**Before hospital discharge** Anticipate problems. Will it happen again? What is their network of support? Review medication (could you stop tranquillizers)? How is progress to be monitored? Liaise with GP/social worker.
