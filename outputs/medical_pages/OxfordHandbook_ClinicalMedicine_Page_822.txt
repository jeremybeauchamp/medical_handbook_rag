# Bradycardia

Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate <60bpm. This may be normal and asymptomatic in very fit, young individuals whose high stroke volumes will maintain adequate cardiac output at low heart rates.

**Symptoms** Often asymptomatic. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness. The presence of syncope, chest pain, or breathlessness is concerning and suggests the presence of adverse signs; sudden cardiac death can occur.

**Rhythm** The immediate management tends to relate more to cause and adverse signs than to the underlying rhythm, which may be •sinus bradycardia •heart block (see p98) •AF with a slow ventricular response •atrial flutter with a high-degree block •junctional bradycardia.

**Causes**
- **Physiological**: Heart rates as low as 40bpm at rest and 30bpm in sleep can be accepted in asymptomatic trained athletes.
- **Cardiac**:
  - Degenerative changes causing fibrosis of conduction pathways (risk in elderly patients; may have previous ECGs showing bundle branch block or 1st- or 2nd-degree heart block).
  - Post-MI—particularly after an inferior MI (the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node in most people).
  - Sick sinus syndrome (p125).
  - Iatrogenic—ablation, surgery.
  - Aortic valve disease, eg infective endocarditis (p150; do daily ECGs looking for heart block).
  - Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, amyloid, sarcoid, SLE.
- **Non-cardiac origin**:
  - Vasovagal—very common (p460).
  - Endocrine—hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency.
  - Metabolic—hyperkalaemia, hypoxia.
  - Other—hypothermia, ↑ICP (Cushing's triad: bradycardia, hypertension, and irregular breathing; **urgent senior input needed**).
- **Drug-induced**:
  - β-blockers, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin.

**Management** ►Follow a logical approach,6 see fig 19.11.6
►►Think ahead. If you may need an anaesthetist to sedate the patient for transcutaneous pacing, or a cardiologist for transvenous pacing, call them now.
- Perform a 12-lead ECG, check electrolytes (including K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), do digoxin levels.
- Connect patient to cardiac monitor/telemetry.
- Address the cause: correct metabolic defects; if the patient has adverse signs or is deteriorating, give antidotes to medicines likely to have caused the bradycardia (eg glucagon if β-blocker overdose).
- If the patient has adverse signs or risk of asystole, give atropine (not to be given if patient has a transplanted heart).
- If atropine is insufficient and adverse signs persist, transcutaneous pacing should be considered (p777). If this cannot be initiated immediately (eg waiting for an anaesthetist), consider other medications such as isoprenaline infusion.
- Remember electrical 'capture' with transcutaneous pacing does not guarantee mechanical 'capture'. Once pacing is established, check the patient's pulse.

►It is possible to have two patients sat next to each other with identical bradycardic ECG tracings, one of whom is peri-arrest, the other is sat comfortably and cannot understand your concern. The clinical state is more important than the numbers on the screen.
