## Acute pancreatitis

This unpredictable disease (mortality ~12%) is characterized by self-perpetuating pancreatic enzyme-mediated autodigestion; oedema and fluid shifts cause hypovolaemia, as extracellular fluid is trapped in the gut, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum (worsened by vomiting). Although pancreatitis is mild in 80% of cases; 20% develop severe complicated and life-threatening disease: progression may be rapid from mild oedema to necrotizing pancreatitis. ~50% of cases that advance to necrosis are further complicated by infection.

### Causes
The one mnemonic we can all agree on: 'GET SMASHED'. Gallstones (~35%), Ethanol (~35%), Trauma (~1.5%), Steroids, Mumps, Autoimmune (PAN), Scorpion venom, Hyperlipidaemia, hypothermia, hypercalcaemia, ERCP (~5%) and emboli, Drugs. Also pregnancy and neoplasia or no cause found (~10-30%).

### Symptoms
Gradual or sudden severe epigastric or central abdominal pain (radiates to back, sitting forward may relieve); vomiting prominent.

### Signs
May be subtle in serious disease. HR, fever, jaundice, shock, ileus, rigid abdomen ± local/general tenderness, periumbilical bruising (Cullen's sign) or flanks (Grey Turner's sign) from blood vessel autodigestion and retroperitoneal haemorrhage.

### Tests
Raised serum amylase (>1000U/mL or around 3-fold upper limit of normal). The degree of elevation is not related to severity of disease. Amylase may be normal even in severe pancreatitis (levels starts to fall within 24-48h). It is excreted renally so renal failure will ↑ levels. Cholecystitis, mesenteric infarction, and GI perforation can cause lesser rises. Serum lipase is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis (especially when related to alcohol), and rises earlier and falls later. ABG to monitor oxygenation and acid-base status. AXR: No psoas shadow (retroperitoneal fluid), 'sentinel loop' of proximal jejunum from ileus (solitary air-filled dilatation). Erect CXR helps exclude other causes (eg perforation). CT is the standard choice of imaging to assess severity and for complications. US (if gallstones + AST). ERCP if LFTs worsen. CRP >150mg/L at 36h after admission is a predictor of severe pancreatitis.

### Management
Severity assessment is essential (see BOX and table 13.17).
- Nil by mouth, consider NJ feeding (decrease pancreatic stimulation). Set up IVI and give lots of crystalloid, to counter third-space sequestration, until vital signs are satisfactory and urine flow stays at >30mL/h. Insert a urinary catheter and consider CVP monitoring.
- Analgesia: pethidine 75-100mg/4h IM, or morphine (may cause Oddi's sphincter to contract more, but it is a better analgesic and not contraindicated).
- Hourly pulse, BP, and urine output; daily FBC, U&E, Ca²⁺, glucose, amylase, ABG.
- If worsening: ITU, O₂ if ↓PaO₂. In suspected abscess formation or pancreatic necrosis (on CT), consider parenteral nutrition ± laparotomy & debridement ('necrosectomy'). Antibiotics may help in severe disease.
- ERCP + gallstone removal may be needed if there is progressive jaundice.
- Repeat imaging (usually CT) is performed in order to monitor progress.

### Early complications
Shock, ARDS (p186), renal failure (give lots of fluid!), DIC, sepsis, ↓Ca²⁺, ↑glucose (transient; 5% need insulin).

### Late complications
(>1wk.) Pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst (fluid in lesser sac, fig 13.45), with fever, a mass ± persistent ↑amylase/LFT; may resolve or need drainage. Abscesses need draining. Bleeding from elastase eroding a major vessel (eg splenic artery); embolization may be life-saving. Thrombosis may occur in the splenic/gastroduodenal arteries, or colic branches of the SMA, causing bowel necrosis. Fistulae normally close spontaneously. If purely pancreatic they do not irritate the skin. Some patients suffer recurrent oedematous pancreatitis so often that near-total pancreatectomy is contemplated. It can all be a miserable course.
