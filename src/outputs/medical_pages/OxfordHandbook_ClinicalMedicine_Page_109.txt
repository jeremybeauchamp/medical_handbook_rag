# Chest pain from the patient's perspective

On acute wards we are always hearing questions such as 'Is your pain sharp or dull?', followed by an equivocal answer. The doctor goes on: 'Sharp like a knife—or dull and crushing?' The doctor is getting irritated because the patient must know the answer but is not saying it. A true story paves the way to being less inquisitorial and having a more creative understanding of the nature of symptoms.

A patient came to a previous OHCM author saying 'Last night I dreamed I had a pain in my chest. Now I've woken up, and I'm not sure—have I got chest pain, doctor? What do you think?' How odd it is to be asked to examine a patient to exclude a symptom, not a disease. (It turned out that she did have serious chest pathology.) Odd, until one realizes that symptoms are often half-formed, and it is our role to give them a local habitation and a name. Dialogue can transform a symptom from 'airy nothingness' to a fact.²

Patients often avoid using the word 'pain' to describe ischaemia: 'wind', 'tightening', 'pressure', 'burning', or 'a lump in the throat' (angina means to choke) may be used. They may say 'sharp' to communicate severity, and not character. So be as vague in your questioning as your patient is in their answers. 'Tell me some more about what you are feeling (long pause) ... as if someone was doing what to you?' 'Sitting on me' or 'like a hotness' might be the response (suggesting cardiac ischaemia). Do not ask 'Does it go into your left arm'. Try 'Is there anything else about it?' (pause) ... 'Does it go anywhere?' Note down your patient's exact words.

A good history, taking account of these features, is the best way to stratify patients likely to have cardiac pain. If the history is non-specific, there are no risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and ECG and plasma troponin T (p118) are normal 6-12h after the onset of pain, discharge will probably be ok.⁴ When in doubt, get help. Features making cardiac pain unlikely:

- Stabbing, shooting pain.
- Pain lasting <30s, however intense.
- Well-localized, left sub-mammary pain ('In my heart, doctor').
- Pains of continually varying location.
- Youth.

Do not feel that you must diagnose every pain. Chest pain with no cause is common, even after extensive tests. Some patients have a 'chronic pain syndrome' similar to post-herpetic neuralgia. Typically, this responds to a tricyclic, eg low-dose amitriptyline at night (this dose does not imply any depression).

Avoid being that doctor who triumphantly tells a patient that they are fine and can go home, only to be met by a glare, as the disabling pain the patient presented with is no better than when they arrived. Take time to explain why you do not believe the pain is a result of dangerous pathology; to give advice on pain control and 'red flags'; and to reassure the patient that their problem is likely to resolve with time.

² Dialogue-transformed symptoms explain one of the junior doctor's main vexations: when patients retell symptoms to a consultant in the light of day, they bear no resemblance to what you originally heard. But do not be vexed: your dialogue may have helped the patient far more than any ward round.
