# Psychiatry on medical and surgical wards

> 'Body and soul cannot be separated for purposes of treatment, for they are one and indivisible. Sick minds must be healed as well as sick bodies.' C Jeff Miller, 1931.

## Mental state examination: ASEPTIC

- **A**ppearance and behaviour: dress, hygiene, eye contact, rapport.
- **S**peech: volume, rate, tone.
- **E**motion: mood (subjective and objective), affect (how mood is expressed with behaviour—appropriate or incongruent?).
- **P**erception: hallucinations—auditory (in the second or third person)?, visual?
- **T**hought:
  - Form: block, insertion, broadcast, flight of ideas, knight's move.
  - Content: delusions, obsessions, phobias, preoccupations, self-harm, suicide.
- **I**nsight: ask the patient why they have presented today.
- **C**ognition: orientation, registration, recall, concentration, knowledge.

Do not be afraid to ask about suicidal thoughts and plans. Remove yourself from the situation if you feel threatened.

## Depression

Two questions can be used to identify depression:

1. During the last month, have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
2. During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?

If a person answers 'yes' to either question they should undergo mental health assessment including a risk assessment of self-harm and suicide. Appropriate treatments include psychosocial intervention (guided self-help, cognitive behavioural therapy, structured physical activity) and medication. Treatment choice depends on disease severity, previous psychiatric history, response to treatment, and patient preference. If medication is indicated, a generic SSRI should be considered first line after consideration of GI bleeding risk, drug interactions, toxicity, overdose, and discontinuation symptoms. The full effect of medication is gradual, over 4-6 weeks.

## Capacity

The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 has a two-stage test for lack of capacity:

1. There is an impairment or disturbed functioning of the mind.
2. The patient is unable to make a decision.

Decision-making is impaired if the patient is unable to: understand the relevant information, retain it for long enough to make a decision, weigh up the information, communicate their decision. Capacity is decision-specific not patient-specific. When treatment is proposed to those who lack capacity, a capacity advocate should be provided. Even patients without capacity should be as involved as possible in decision-making.

## Mental Health Act (MHA) and common law

A patient can be detained under common law (subject to a test of reasonableness) or under the MHA, only if they lack capacity to remain informally and are a danger to themselves or others. You will have more experience in verbal and non-verbal communication, than in detention under the MHA, so use these skills first to try and de-escalate the situation. If rapid tranquillization is needed, be familiar with dosage, side-effects, and the need for ongoing observation. If there is no history to guide choice of medication, intramuscular lorazepam can be used.

## Doctors and mental health

Suicide rates are three times higher in doctors compared to the general population. Up to 7% of doctors will have a substance abuse problem within their lifetime. Do not ignore feeling low, poor concentration, and reduced energy levels. Do not self-diagnose and manage. Avoid 'corridor consultations'. Trust your GP. Seek support:
