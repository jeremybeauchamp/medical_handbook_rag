## Joints

Examine for acute inflammation (swollen, red joints) as well as the characteristic deformities of chronic arthritis, eg rheumatoid, osteoarthritis (fig 2.38).
- Ulnar deviation at the wrist.
- Z deformity of the thumb.
- Swan-neck (flexed DIP, hyperextended PIP—fig 12.2, p540).
- Boutonnière (hyperextended DIP, flexed PIP).
- Heberden's nodes (DIP joints, p77).
- Bouchard's nodes (PIP joints).

## Move and feel

By this point, you should know the likely diagnosis, so assess neurological function looking at power, function, and sensation:
- Wrist and forearm: Extension (prayer position) and flexion (reverse prayer), supination and pronation. Look at the elbows.
- Small muscles: Pincer grip, power grip (squeeze my two fingers), abduction of the thumb, abduction (spread your fingers), and adduction (grip this piece of paper between your fingers) of the fingers. NB Froment's sign = flexion of the thumb during grip as ulnar nerve lesion prevents adduction (p453).
- Function: Write a sentence, undo a button, pick up a coin.
- Sensation: Test little finger (ulnar), index finger (median), and anatomical snuffbox (radial) using light touch/pinprick.

When you have clinched the diagnosis and functional status, examine each joint, palpating for tenderness, effusions, and crepitus. Test sensation (see p67) and examine the elbows. Consider examination of upper limbs and face.

### Top tips
- Cross your fingers before the patient grips them, it hurts less!
- Don't forget to palpate the radial pulse.
- Don't forget to look at the elbows for plaques of psoriasis and rheumatoid nodules.
