## Clostridium difficile

Gram-positive anaerobic bacillus and most common healthcare-associated pathogen. Part of colonic flora in 2-5% of healthy adults, and 20-40% of hospitalized adults. Disease occurs when it converts to a vegetative (growth) state with production of enterotoxins A and B, causing colitis. Typically happens when inhibition by competing colonic flora is lost due to antibiotic exposure.

**Presentation:** Watery diarrhoea, mild→fulminant colitis (pseudomembranes on endoscopy='pseudomembranous colitis'), ileus, toxic megacolon. Consider in all diarrhoea associated with antibiotic use, especially if marked neutrophilia.

**Diagnosis:** Immunoassay for glutamate dehydrogenase (common antigen) detects all strains of C. difficile. Detection of toxin (toxin immunoassay, toxin gene nucleic acid amplification) distinguishes infection from carriage.

**Management:** SIGHT: Suspect, Isolate within 2h, Gloves and aprons, Hand wash with soap, Test immediately.

- Mild/moderate: metronidazole PO.
- Severe (WCC >15×10⁹/L or AKI or colitis or temperature >38.5°C): vancomycin PO (injection preparation can be given orally and is cheaper than capsules) or fidaxomicin (£cost).
- Non-responders: high-dose vancomycin+IV metronidazole, fidaxomicin, IV immunoglobulin (no RCT data).
- Recurrence: (weaning) vancomycin, fidaxomicin, faecal transplantation.

## Management of healthcare-associated infection

**Identify:** Screening (eg hospital admissions for MRSA) allows isolation and decolonization before harm. Be alert to new infections.

**Protect:** Isolate multi-antibiotic-resistant microbes (eg MRSA), highly transmissible infections (eg norovirus), and high-risk groups including reverse barrier nursing (avoids transmission to, rather than from, patients, eg neutropenia). Patients with high-risk infections may need negative-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially infected air leaving the room), or in severe immunosuppression, positive-pressure rooms (to prevent potentially infected air entering the room). When many patients have the same nosocomial infection (eg norovirus) they may be barrier nursed together in dedicated bays.

**Treat:** Refer to local guidelines, seek expert help. Initial antibiotic choice may differ for healthcare-associated infection.

**Prevent:** Modify risk factors, eg nutrition, post-operative incentive spirometry to reduce pneumonia risk. Use/convert to narrow-spectrum antibiotics whenever possible. Remove catheters, intravascular access devices, and wean off ventilators as soon as clinically appropriate. Take measures to ↓ person-to-person transmission:

1. **Hand hygiene.** Wash hands before and after each patient contact (fig 9.22). Alcohol-based gels are helpful but soap is needed to kill C. difficile spores.

2. **Personal attire.** In the UK there is a bare-below-the-elbows policy. Long hair should be tied back. In areas where infection risk is particularly high (theatre, ICU), staff change into scrubs on arrival.

3. **Personal protective equipment (PPE).** Used for isolated patients and during procedures. Includes gloves, aprons, caps, respiratory protection/mask according to risk, eg FFP3 respirators in aerosolized infection.

4. **Procedures.** Strict aseptic techniques for any procedure which breaches the body's defences including insertion/maintenance of invasive devices, IV infusions, wound care.

5. **Environment.** Should be clean and safe, with effective decontamination.

**System interventions:** Up-to-date infection guidelines, audit, education, training.
