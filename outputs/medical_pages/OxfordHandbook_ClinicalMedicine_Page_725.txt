# Causes of a long QT interval

Many conditions and drugs (check BNF) cause a long QT interval. Brugada syndrome (p695) is similar, predisposing to sudden cardiac death.

**Congenital:** Romano-Ward syndrome (autosomal dominant). Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (autosomal recessive) with associated deafness (p702).

**Cardiac:** Myocardial infarction or ischaemia; mitral valve prolapse.

**HIV:** May be a direct effect of the virus or from protease inhibitors.

**Metabolic:** ↓K+; ↓Mg2+; ↓Ca2+; starvation; hypothyroidism; hypothermia.

**Toxic:** Organophosphates.

**Anti-arrhythmic drugs:** Quinidine; amiodarone; procainamide; sotalol.

**Antimicrobials:** Erythromycin; levofloxacin; pentamidine; halofantrine.

**Antihistamines:** Terfenadine; astemizole.

**Motility drugs:** Domperidone.

**Psychoactive drugs:** Haloperidol; risperidone; tricyclics; SSRIs.

**Connective tissue diseases:** Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (p552).

**Herbalism:** Ask about Chinese folk remedies (may contain unknown amounts of arsenic). Cocaine, quinine, and artemisinins (and other antimalarials) are examples of herbalism-derived products that can prolong the QT interval.
