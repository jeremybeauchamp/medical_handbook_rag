# The renal tubule: disorders and diuretics

Tubular disorders and the action of diuretics can be considered according to the affected segment of the nephron (fig 7.13 and table 7.8).

Fig 7.13 The nephron divided into segments (proximal tubule, thick ascending loop of Henle, distal tubule, collecting duct) with key solute movement (red).

## Table 7.8 Summary table of tubular disorders and diuretic action (RTA = renal tubular acidosis)

| Nephron segment | Solute movement | Tubular pathology | Diuretic |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Proximal tubule | Reabsorption: Na+, HCO3-, phosphate, sugars, amino acids | Fanconi syndrome Proximal (type 2) RTA | Mannitol Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor |
| Thick ascending loop | Reabsorption: Na+, K+, Cl- | Bartter syndromes | Loop |
| Distal tubule | Reabsorption: Na+, Cl- | Gitelman syndrome | Thiazide |
| Cortical collecting duct | Excretion: K+, H+ | Distal (type 1) RTA Type 4 RTA | K+-sparing |
| Collecting duct | Excretion: water | Diabetes insipidus (p240) | V2 antagonists ('vaptan') (p320) |

## Proximal tubule

### Physiology
Reabsorbs Na+ (~70%), bicarbonate, phosphate, amino acids, sugars, uric acid.

### Pathology
Fanconi syndrome: Generalized impairment of proximal tubular function leading to glycosuria (in a non-diabetic), phosphaturia, uricosuria, aminoaciduria, and tubular-proteinuria (negative dipstick but positive urine P:CR p294). Phosphaturia leads to phosphate loss from bone, demineralization, and growth impairment. Treatment: replace phosphate. Proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Failure of bicarbonate reabsorption. Distal reabsorption intact so serum bicarbonate usually ≥12mmol/L. Accompanied by Fanconi syndrome unless rare familial cause. Aetiology: light chain disease, drugs (eg tenofovir), heavy metals. Diagnosis: IV bicarbonate increases bicarbonate loss in urine and causes rapid rise in urine pH to ~7.5. Treatment: bicarbonate and potassium replacement.

### Diuretics
Osmotic diuretic (eg mannitol): Used to ↓ICP and intra-ocular pressure. Freely filtered but poorly reabsorbed, holding water by osmosis. Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, Mg2+, HCO3- may be affected. Risk of pulmonary oedema if oligo/anuric. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (eg acetazolamide): Used in altitude sickness, glaucoma. Metabolic acidosis due to ↑bicarbonate excretion. Risk of nephrocalcinosis.
