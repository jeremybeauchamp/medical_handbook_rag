# Features of vasculitis

The presentation of vasculitis will depend on the organs affected:

- **Systemic:** Fever, malaise, weight loss, arthralgia, myalgia.
- **Skin:** Purpura, ulcers, livedo reticularis (fig 12.17), nailbed infarcts, digital gangrene.
- **Eyes:** Episcleritis, scleritis, visual loss.
- **ENT:** Epistaxis, nasal crusting, stridor, deafness.
- **Pulmonary:** Haemoptysis and dyspnoea (due to pulmonary haemorrhage).
- **Cardiac:** Angina or MI (due to coronary arteritis), heart failure, and pericarditis.
- **GI:** Pain or perforation (infarcted viscus), malabsorption (chronic ischaemia).
- **Renal:** Hypertension, haematuria, proteinuria, casts, and renal failure (renal cortical infarcts; glomerulonephritis in ANCA +ve vasculitis).
- **Neurological:** Stroke, fits, chorea, psychosis, confusion, impaired cognition, altered mood. Arteritis of the vasa nervorum (arterial supply to peripheral nerves) may cause mononeuritis multiplex or a sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
- **GU:** Orchitis—testicular pain or tenderness.

# Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)

PMR is not a true vasculitis and its pathogenesis is unknown. PMR and GCA share the same demographic characteristics and, although separate conditions, the two frequently occur together.

**Features:** Age >50yrs; subacute onset (<2 weeks) of bilateral aching, tenderness, and morning stiffness in shoulders, hips, and proximal limb muscles ± fatigue, fever, weight, anorexia, and depression. There may be associated mild polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (10%). Weakness is not a feature.

**Investigations:** ↑CRP, ESR typically >40 (but may be normal); AlkP is ↑ in 30%. Note creatinine kinase levels are normal (helping to distinguish from myositis/myopathies).

**Differential diagnoses:** Recent-onset RA, polymyositis, hypothyroidism, primary muscle disease, occult malignancy or infection, osteoarthritis (especially cervical spondylosis, shoulder OA), neck lesions, bilateral subacromial impingement (OHCS Rheumatology p666), spinal stenosis (OHCS p676).

**Management:** Prednisolone 15mg/d PO. Expect a dramatic response within 1 week and consider an alternative diagnosis if not. ↓ dose slowly, eg by 1mg/month (according to symptoms/ESR). Investigate apparent 'flares' during withdrawal—attributable to another condition? Most need steroids for ≥2yrs, so give bone protection. Addition of methotrexate may be considered, under specialist supervision, for patients at risk of relapse/prolonged therapy. NSAIDs are not effective. Inform patients to seek urgent review if symptoms of GCA develop.
