# Neuroimaging

CT (fig 16.39) Imaging modality of choice for patients presenting with acute neurological symptoms suggestive of a stroke. It is better than MRI at showing acute haemorrhage and fractures, and is much easier to do in ill or anaesthetized patients, and so is good in emergencies. The attenuation of biological soft tissues is in a narrow range from about +80 for blood and muscle, to 0 for CSF, and down to -100 for fat (Hounsfield units, p730). IV contrast medium initially gives an angiographic effect, whitening the vessels. Later, if there is a defect in the blood-brain barrier (eg tumours or infection), contrast medium will opacify a lesion's margins, giving enhancing white areas.

- Some CNS areas, eg pituitary gland, choroid plexus, have no blood-brain barrier and enhance normally.
- Fresh blood is of higher attenuation (ie whiter) than brain tissue.
- In old haematomas, Hb breaks down and loses attenuation, so a subacute subdural haematoma at 2wks may be of the same attenuation as adjacent brain.
- A chronic subdural haematoma will be of relatively low attenuation.

CT is often used in acute stroke to exclude haemorrhage (eg pre-antiplatelets) and with perfusion scanning (fig 16.14) to aid management decisions regarding thrombolysis. The actual area of infarction/ischaemia may not show up for a day or so, and will be low-attenuation cytotoxic oedema (affecting both white and grey matter—look for loss of grey matter definition).

Tumours and abscesses appear similar, eg a ring-enhancing mass, surrounding vasogenic oedema, and mass effect. Vasogenic oedema (from leaky capillaries) is extracellular and spreads through the white matter (grey matter spared). Mass effect causes compression of the sulci and ipsilateral ventricles, and may also cause herniation (subfalcine, transtentorial, or tonsillar). ►See p483 (and also fig 16.40).

Another indication for CT is acute, severe headache, eg suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478). An unenhanced CT may show fresh blood, hydrocephalus or ↑ICP, any of which could make LP unsafe.

CT angiography gives excellent mapping of the cerebral circulation (fig 16.41), and can be done directly after unenhanced CT, looking for an aneurysm if the unenhanced CT shows subarachnoid haemorrhage.

MRI (MRI in stroke: fig 10.19, p481) The chief image sequences are:
- T1-weighted images: Give good anatomical detail to which the T2 image can be compared. Fat is brightest (signal intensity); other tissues are darker to varying degrees. Flowing blood is low signal. Gadolinium contrast (p748) usually results in an increase in signal intensity. See table 16.4.
- T2-weighted images: These provide the best detection of most lesions as they usually contain some oedema or fluid and therefore appear white (eg fig 16.20, p735). Fat and fluid appear brightest. Flowing blood is again low signal.

Magnetic resonance angiography maps carotid, vertebrobasilar, and cerebral arterial circulations (and sinuses, veins). Functional MRI can image local blood flow.

Catheter angiography (fig 16.42) Less commonly used since the advent of MRA and CT angiography and perfusion techniques, though it has the advantage of allowing immediate therapy—eg coil embolization of saccular aneurysms.

Radionuclide imaging (p738) PET is mostly used as a research tool in dementia, but perfusion scintigraphy scan be used in the assessment of Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, and localizing epileptogenic foci. SPECT to visualize uptake of 123I-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN™) can be used to assess reduced striatal dopaminergic transport in Parkinson's disease.
