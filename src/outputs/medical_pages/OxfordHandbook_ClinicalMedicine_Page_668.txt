## Aneurysms of arteries

An artery with a dilatation >50% of its original diameter has an aneurysm; remember this is an ongoing process. True aneurysms are abnormal dilatations that involve all layers of the arterial wall. False aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) involve a collection of blood in the outer layer only (adventitia) which communicates with the lumen (eg after trauma). Aneurysms may be fusiform (eg most AAAs) or sac-like (eg Berry aneurysms; fig 10.17 p479).

**Causes** Atheroma, trauma, infection (eg mycotic aneurysm in endocarditis; tertiary syphilis—especially thoracic aneurysms), connective tissue disorders (eg Marfan's, Ehlers-Danlos), inflammatory (eg Takayasu's aortitis, p712).

**Common sites** Aorta (infrarenal most common), iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries.

**Complications** Rupture; thrombosis; embolism; fistulae; pressure on other structures.

**Screening** All ♂ at age 65yr are invited for screening in UK, decreases mortality from ruptured AAA.

**Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)** Death rates/year from ruptured AAAs rise with age: 125 per million in those aged 55-59; 2728 per million if over 85yrs.
*Symptoms & signs:* Intermittent or continuous abdominal pain (radiates to back, iliac fossae, or groins; don't dismiss this as renal colic), collapse, an expansile abdominal mass (it expands and contracts, unlike swellings that are purely pulsatile, eg nodes overlying arteries), and shock. If in doubt, assume a ruptured aneurysm.

**Unruptured AAA** *Definition:* >3cm across. *Prevalence:* 3% of those >50yrs. ♂:♀ >3:1. Less common in diabetics. *Cause:* Degeneration of elastic lamellae and smooth muscle loss. There is a genetic component. *Symptoms:* Often none, they may cause abdominal/back pain, often discovered incidentally on abdominal examination (see BOX). *Monitoring:* RCTs have failed to demonstrate benefit from early endovascular repair (EVAR, see later in paragraph) of aneurysms <5.5cm (where rupture rates are low). Risk of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms >6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rupture is more likely if: •↑BP •Smoker •♀ •Positive family history. Modify risk factors if possible at diagnosis. *Elective surgery:* Reserve for aneurysms ≥5.5cm or expanding at >1cm/yr, or symptomatic aneurysms. Operative mortality: ~5%; complications include spinal or visceral ischaemia and distal emboli from dislodged thrombus debris. Studies show that age >80yrs should not, in itself, preclude surgery. *Stenting (EVAR):* Major surgery can be avoided by inserting an endovascular stent via the femoral artery. EVAR has less early mortality but higher graft complications, eg failure of stent-graft to totally exclude blood flow to the aneurysm—'endoleak'. See fig 13.52.

### Emergency management of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm

Mortality—treated: 41% and improving; untreated: ~100%.

- Summon a vascular surgeon and an experienced anaesthetist; warn theatre.
- Do an ECG, and take blood for amylase, Hb, crossmatch (10-40U may eventually be needed). Catheterize the bladder.
- Gain IV access with 2 large-bore cannulae. Treat shock with O Rh-ve blood (if not cross matched), but keep systolic BP ≤100mmHg to avoid rupturing a contained leak (NB: raised BP is common early on).
- Take the patient straight to theatre. Don't waste time on X-rays: fatal delay may result, though CT can help in a stable patient with an uncertain diagnosis.
- Give prophylactic antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg IV.
- Surgery involves clamping the aorta above the leak, and inserting a Dacron® graft (eg 'tube graft' or, if significant iliac aneurysm also, a 'trouser graft' with each 'leg' attached to an iliac artery).
