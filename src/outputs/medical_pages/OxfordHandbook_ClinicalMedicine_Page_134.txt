## Management of ACS

ACS management depends on whether the ACS is 'ST elevated' or not:

1. ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI): this category includes ACS with ST elevation on ECG (fig 3.9) but also ACS with new LBBB (fig 3.7); and posterior MIs (fig 3.24) where ST elevation may only be seen with extra leads (V7-V9). Urgent revascularization is essential. ▶p796.

2. ACS without ST elevation: serial troponins are needed to differentiate non-ST elevated MIs (NSTEMIs) (trop rise) from unstable angina (no trop rise). ▶▶p798.

After the immediate actions described on pp796-9, treatment of ACS" focuses on managing symptoms, secondary prevention of further cardiovascular disease, revascularization (if not already undertaken), and addressing complications.

### Symptom control
Manage chest pain with PRN GTN and opiates. If this proves insufficient, consider a GTN infusion (monitor BP, omit if recent sildenafil use). If pain is deteriorating, seek senior help. Manage symptomatic heart failure, p136.

### Modify risk factors
- Patients should be strongly advised and helped to stop smoking (p93).
- Identify and treat diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia.
- Advise a diet high in oily fish, fruit, vegetables, & fibre, and low in saturated fats.
- Encourage daily exercise. Refer to a cardiac rehab programme.
- Mental health: flag to the patient's GP if depression or anxiety are present—these are independently associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes.

### Optimize cardioprotective medications
- Antiplatelets: aspirin (75mg OD) and a second antiplatelet agent (eg clopidogrel) for at least 12 months to ↓vascular events (eg MI, stroke). Consider adding a PPI (eg lansoprazole) for gastric protection.
- Anticoagulate, eg with fondaparinux, until discharge.
- β-blockade reduces myocardial oxygen demand. Start low and increase slowly, monitoring pulse and BP. If contraindicated, consider verapamil or diltiazem.
- ACE-i in patients with LV dysfunction, hypertension, or diabetes unless not tolerated (consider ARB). Titrate up slowly, monitoring renal function.
- High-dose statin, eg atorvastatin 80mg.
- Do an echo to assess LV function. Eplerenone improves outcomes in MI patients with heart failure (ejection fraction <40%).

### Revascularization
- STEMI patients and very high-risk NSTEMI patients (eg haemodynamically unstable) should receive immediate angiography ± PCI. NSTEMI patients who are high risk (eg GRACE score >140) should have angiography within 24h; intermediate risk (eg GRACE 109-140) within 3d; low-risk patients may be considered for non-invasive testing.
- Patients with multivessel disease may be considered for CABG instead of PCI (p123).

### Manage complications See p122.

### Discharge 
Address any questions the patient has. Discuss 'red flag' symptoms and where to seek medical advice should they arise. Ensure the management plan is communicated to the patient's GP. Book clinic and cardiac rehab appointments.

### General advice
- Driving:18 drivers with group 1 licences (car and motorcycle) can resume driving 1wk after successful angioplasty, or 4wk after ACS without successful angioplasty, if their ejection fraction is >40%. Group 2 licence holders must inform the DVLA of their ACS and stop driving; depending on the results of functional tests, they may be able to restart after 6wk.
- Work: how soon a patient can return to work will depend on their clinical progress and the nature of their work. They should be encouraged to discuss speed of return ± changes in duties (eg to lighter work if manual labour) with their employer. Some occupations cannot be restarted post-MI: eg airline pilots & air traffic controllers. Drivers of public service or heavy goods vehicles will have to undergo functional testing (eg exercise test), as mentioned previously.
