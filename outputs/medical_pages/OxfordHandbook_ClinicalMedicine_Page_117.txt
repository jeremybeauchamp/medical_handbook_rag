The image shows an electrocardiogram (ECG) with 12 leads labeled I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6. The ECG is printed on pink graph paper. Below the ECG, there is a caption describing the findings.

Fig 3.9 Acute infero-lateral myocardial infarction: marked ST elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, aVF), but also in V5 and V6, indicating lateral involvement. There is a 'reciprocal change' of ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL; this is often seen with a large inferior myocardial infarction.

The ECG shows:
1. Significant ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (inferior leads)
2. ST-segment elevation also visible in leads V5 and V6 (lateral leads)
3. Reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL

These findings are consistent with an acute infero-lateral myocardial infarction, as described in the caption.

At the bottom of the image, there's a green bar with "Cardiovascular medicine" written on it, and the page number 103 is visible in the corner.
