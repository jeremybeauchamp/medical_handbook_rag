## Diarrhoea

Diarrhoea is characterized by increased stool frequency and volume and decreased consistency—though patients' perspectives of these may vary wildly.

### History
As ever, a careful history will help narrow myriad causes to just a few. Acute or chronic? If acute (<2wks) suspect gastroenteritis—any risk factors: Travel? Diet change? Contact with D&V? Any fever/pain? HIV; achlorhydria, eg PA, p334, or on acid suppressants, eg PPI? Chronic diarrhoea alternating with constipation suggests irritable bowel (p266). Weight, nocturnal diarrhoea, or anaemia mandate close follow-up (coeliac/UC/Crohn's?).

- **Bloody diarrhoea:** Campylobacter, Shigella/Salmonella (p431), E. coli, amoebiasis (p432), UC, Crohn's, colorectal cancer (p616), colonic polyps, pseudomembranous colitis, ischaemic colitis (p620). Fresh PR bleeding: p629.
- **Mucus:** Occurs in IBS (p266), colorectal cancer, and polyps.
- **Frank pus:** Suggests IBD, diverticulitis, or a fistula/abscess.
- **Explosive:** Eg cholera; Giardia; Yersinia (p425); Rotavirus.
- **Steatorrhoea:** Characterized by ↑gas, offensive smell, and floating, hard-to-flush stools—consider pancreatic insufficiency (p267) or biliary obstruction.

### Look for
Dehydration—dry mucous membranes, ↓skin turgor; capillary refill >2s; shock. Any fever, ↓weight, clubbing, anaemia, oral ulcers (p246), rashes or abdominal mass or scars? Any goitre/hyperthyroid signs? Do rectal exam for masses (eg rectal cancer) or impacted faeces:

- **Blood:** FBC: MCV/Fe deficiency, eg coeliac or colon ca; ↑MCV if alcohol abuse or B12 absorption, eg in coeliac or Crohn's; eosinophilia if parasites. ESR/CRP: infection, Crohn's/UC, cancer. U&E: K+ ≈ severe D&V. ↓TSH: thyrotoxicosis. Coeliac serology: p266.
- **Stool:** MC&S: bacterial pathogens, ova cysts, parasites, C. diff toxin (CDT, see BOX 'Causes of diarrhoea'), viral PCR. Faecal elastase: if suspect chronic pancreatitis (malabsorption, steatorrhoea).
- **Lower GI endoscopy:** (Malignancy? colitis?) ► If acutely unwell, limited flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. Full colonoscopy (including terminal ileum) can assess for more proximal disease If normal, consider small bowel radiology or video capsule.

### Management
Treat cause. Food handlers: no work until stool samples are -ve. If a hospital outbreak, wards may need closing. Oral rehydration is better than IV, but ► if sustained diarrhoea or vomiting, IV fluids with appropriate electrolyte replacement may be needed. Codeine phosphate 30mg/8h PO or loperamide 2mg PO after each loose stool (max 16mg/day) ↓stool frequency (avoid in colitis; both may precipitate toxic megacolon). Avoid antibiotics unless infective diarrhoea is causing systemic upset (fig 6.20). Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea¹² may respond to probiotics (eg lactobacilli).

### Causes of diarrhoea

| Common | Non-GI or rare causes |
|--------|------------------------|
| • Gastroenteritis (p428) | • Thyrotoxicosis |
| • Traveller's diarrhoea (p429) | • Autonomic neuropathy |
| • C. difficile (BOX 'Clostridium difficile') | • Addison's disease |
| • IBS (p266) | • Ischaemic colitis |
| • Colorectal cancer | • Tropical sprue • Pellagra |
| • Crohn's; UC; coeliac. | • Gastrinoma • VIPoma¹⁴ |
| | • Carcinoid • Amyloid. |

| Less common causes (Esp. if painful) | Drugs |
|--------------------------------------|-------|
| • Microscopic colitis¹³ | (Many, see BNF.) |
| • Chronic pancreatitis | • Antibiotics¹² • PPI |
| • Bile salt malabsorption | • Propranolol • NSAIDs |
| • Laxative abuse | • Cytotoxics • Digoxin |
| • Lactose intolerance | • Laxatives • Alcohol. |
| • Ileal/gastric resection | |
| • Overflow diarrhoea | |
| • Bacterial overgrowth. | |

12. Erythromycin is prokinetic, others cause overgrowth of bowel organisms, or alter bile acids.
13. Think of this in any chronic watery diarrhoea; diagnosis by biopsy. Associated with a range of drugs including NSAIDs and PPIs. Stop the offending drug where possible. Treat with budesonide.
14. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumour; suspect if ↓K+ and acidosis; ↓Ca²+; ↓Mg²+.
