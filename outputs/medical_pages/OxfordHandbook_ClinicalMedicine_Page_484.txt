# Stroke: clinical features and acute management

Infarction or bleeding into the brain manifests with sudden-onset focal CNS signs. Someone in the UK has a stroke every 3.5 minutes; 1 in 4 of those will die within a year and half of survivors will have a permanent disability.

## Causes
- Small vessel occlusion/cerebral microangiopathy or thrombosis *in situ*.
- Cardiac emboli (AF; endocarditis; MI—see BOX 'Cardiac causes of stroke', p473).
- Atherothromboembolism (eg from carotids).
- CNS bleeds (HBP, trauma, aneurysm rupture, anticoagulation, thrombolysis).

### Other causes:
Consider in younger patients: sudden BP drop by ≥40mmHg (most likely to affect the boundary zone between vascular beds), carotid artery dissection (spontaneous, or from neck trauma or fibromuscular dysplasia), vasculitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478), venous sinus thrombosis (p480), antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombophilia (p374), Fabry disease (p698), CADASIL.

## Differentials
Head injury, hypo/hyperglycaemia, subdural haemorrhage, intracranial tumours, hemiplegic migraine, post-ictal (Todd's palsy), CNS lymphoma, Wernicke's encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cerebral abscesses, mycotic aneurysm, drug overdose (if comatose).

## Modifiable risk factors
HBP, smoking, DM, heart disease (valvular, ischaemic, AF), peripheral vascular disease, PCV, carotid bruit, combined OCP, lipids, alcohol use, clotting (eg plasma fibrinogen, antithrombin III, p374), homocysteine, syphilis.

## Signs
Worst at onset. Pointers to bleeding (unreliable!): meningism, severe headache, coma. Pointers to ischaemia: carotid bruit, AF, past TIA, IHD.

### Cerebral infarcts:
(50%.) Depending on site there may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia—initially flaccid (floppy limb, falls like a dead weight when lifted), becoming spastic (UMN); dysphasia; homonymous hemianopia; visuo-spatial deficit.

### Brainstem infarcts:
(25%.) Varied; include quadriplegia, disturbances of gaze and vision, locked-in syndrome (aware, but unable to respond).

### Lacunar infarcts:
(25%). Basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons.) Five syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, and dysarthria/clumsy hand. Cognition/consciousness are intact except in thalamic strokes.

## Acute management
- **Protect the airway:** This avoids hypoxia/aspiration.
- **Maintain homeostasis:** Blood glucose: keep between 4–11 mmol/L. Blood pressure: only treat if there is a hypertensive emergency (eg encephalopathy or aortic dissection) or thrombolysis is considered (ideally aim for ≤185/110) as treating even very high BPs may impair cerebral perfusion.
- **Screen swallow:** 'Nil by mouth' until this is done (but keep hydrated).
- **CT/MRI within 1h:** Essential if: thrombolysis considered, high risk of haemorrhage (↓GCS, signs of ↑ICP, severe headache, meningism, progressive symptoms, bleeding tendency or anticoagulated), or unusual presentation (eg fluctuating consciousness, fever). Otherwise imaging less urgent (aim <24h). Diffusion-weighted MRI is most sensitive for an acute infarct, but CT helps rule out primary haemorrhage (fig 10.15).
- **Antiplatelet agents:** Once haemorrhagic stroke is excluded, give aspirin 300mg (continue for 2 weeks, then switch to long-term antithrombotic treatment, p472).
- **Thrombolysis:** Consider this as soon as haemorrhage has been excluded, provided the onset of symptoms was ≤4.5h ago. The benefits of thrombolysis outweigh the risks within this window, though best results are within 90min. Alteplase is the agent of choice and must be given by trained staff, ideally within an expert acute stroke team. Always do CT 24h post-lysis to identify bleeds. CI to thrombolysis:
  - Major infarct or haemorrhage on CT.
  - Mild/non-disabling deficit.
  - Recent surgery, trauma, or artery or vein puncture at uncompressible site.
  - Previous CNS bleed.
  - AVM/aneurysm.
  - Severe liver disease, varices, or portal hypertension.
  - Seizures at presentation.
  - Blood glucose (<3 or >22).
  - Stroke or serious head injury in last 3 months.
  - GI or urinary tract haemorrhage in the last 21 days.
  - Known clotting disorder.
  - Anticoagulants or INR >1.7.
  - Platelets <100×10⁹/L.
  - History of intracranial neoplasm.
  - Rapidly improving symptoms.
  - BP >180/105.
- **Thrombectomy:** Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy provides additional benefit for those with large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation.
- Admit to an acute stroke unit: multidisciplinary care improves outcomes (p474).
