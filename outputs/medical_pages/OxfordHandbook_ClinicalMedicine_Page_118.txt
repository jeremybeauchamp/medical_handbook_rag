| I | aVR | V1 | V4 |
|---|-----|----|----|
| [ECG trace showing normal sinus rhythm] | [ECG trace with inverted P waves and QRS complexes] | [ECG trace showing ST elevation and Q waves] | [ECG trace showing prominent R waves] |

| II | aVL | V2 | V5 |
|---|-----|----|----|
| [ECG trace showing normal sinus rhythm] | [ECG trace with small deflections] | [ECG trace showing ST elevation and Q waves] | [ECG trace showing tall R waves] |

| III | aVF | V3 | V6 |
