# 280 Alcoholism

An alcoholic is one whose problematic pattern of alcohol use leads to clinically significant impairment or distress, manifested by multiple psychosocial, behavioural, or physiological features. Other addictions may coexist. Lifetime prevalence: ♂~10% (♀≈4%). ▶Denial is a leading feature, so be sure to question relatives.

## Organs affected 
▶Don't forget the risk of trauma while intoxicated.

**The liver:** Normal in 50%; ↑ or ↑↑γGT—but may be ↑↑ in any type of liver inflammation, eg fatty liver, AIH (p284), HBV. Fatty liver: Acute/reversible, but may progress to cirrhosis if drinking continues (also seen in obesity, DM, and with amiodarone).
Alcoholic hepatitis: See BOX 'Managing alcoholic hepatitis'. 80% progress to cirrhosis (hepatic failure in 10%). Cirrhosis: (See p276.) 5yr survival is 48% if drinking continues (if not, 77%). Biopsy: Mallory bodies ± neutrophil infiltrate (can be indistinguishable from NASH, p277).

**CNS:** Self neglect; ↓memory/cognition: high-potency vitamins IM may reverse it (p714; don't delay!); cortical atrophy; retrobulbar neuropathy; fits; falls; wide-based gait; neuropathy; confabulation/Korsakoff's (p704) ± Wernicke's encephalopathy (p714).

**Gut:** Obesity; D&V; gastric erosions; peptic ulcers; varices (p257); pancreatitis (acute or chronic); cancer (many types); oesophageal rupture (↑↑ vomiting against a closed glottis; suspect if shock and surgical emphysema in the neck: Boerhaave's syndrome).

**Blood:** ↑MCV; anaemia from: marrow depression, GI bleeding, alcoholism-associated folate deficiency, haemolysis; sideroblastic anaemia. See p326.

**Heart:** Arrhythmias; ↑BP; cardiomyopathy; sudden death in binge drinkers.

**Reproduction:** Testicular atrophy; ↓testosterone/progesterone; ↑oestrogen; fetal alcohol syndrome—↓IQ, short palpebral fissure, absent philtrum, and small eyes.

**Withdrawal** starts 10–72h after last drink. Signs: ↑Pulse; ↑BP; tremor; confusion; fits; hallucinations (delirium tremens)—may be visual or tactile, eg animals crawling all over skin. Consider it in any new (<3d) ward patient with acute confusion.

## Management Alcohol withdrawal: 
There is almost no role for hospital inpatient 'detox' as a sole indication for admission however attractive the idea of a 'quick fix' may be—community-based services are much better placed to support cessation. Admit only if complicating or coexisting medical problems require inpatient treatment. Check BP + TPR/4h. Beware ↓BP. For the 1st 3d give generous chlordiazepoxide, eg 10–50mg/6h PO with additional doses PRN, then sum total dose and plan weaning regimen over 5–7d. Vitamins may be needed (p714). Prevention: (OHCS p512.) Alcohol-free beers; price may help promote lower-risk drinking. NB: there are no absolutes: risk is a continuum. Suggest: 1 Graceful ways of declining a drink, eg 'I'm seeing what it's like to go without for a bit'. 2 Not buying him- or herself a drink when it is his/her turn. 3 'Don't lift your glass to your lips until after the slowest drinker in your group takes a drink.' 4 'Sip, don't gulp.' Give follow-up and encouragement. Treating established alcoholics: May be rewarding, particularly if they really want to change. If so, group therapy or self-help (eg Alcoholics Anonymous) may be useful—especially if self-initiated and determined. Encourage the will to change.

**Relapse** 50% will relapse soon after starting treatment. Acamprosate (p449)may help intense anxiety, insomnia, and craving. CI: pregnancy, severe liver failure, creatinine >120μmol/L. SE: D&V, ↑ or ↓ libido; dose example: 666mg/8h PO if >60kg and <65yrs old. It should be started as soon as acute withdrawal is complete and continued for ~1yr. Disulfiram can be used to treat chronic alcohol dependence. It causes acetaldehyde build-up (like metronidazole) with extremely unpleasant effects to any alcohol ingestion—eg flushing, throbbing headache, palpitations. Care must be taken to avoid alcohol (eg toiletries, food, medicines) since severe reactions can occur. ▶Confer with experts if drugs are to be used.

30 γGT is ↑ in 52% of alcoholics; it is also ↑ in 50% of those with non-alcoholic fatty livers. Its best use is not in diagnosing alcoholism but in seeing if a raised ALP is likely to be from liver, not bone.
