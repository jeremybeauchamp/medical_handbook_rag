# Management of suspected bacterial meningitis and meningococcal sepsis

ABCs: IVI + fluid resus. Check and correct blood glucose

| Meningitic: (eg neck stiffness; photophobia) without shock | Septicaemic: eg shock (prolonged capillary refill time; cold hands + feet; ↓BP), evolving rash |

Careful monitoring

Subsequent therapy: Discuss antibiotic therapy with microbiology and adjust based on organism and local sensitivities. Maintain normovolaemia with IVI if needed. Isolate for 1st 24h. Inform Public Health, p381.
