# 816 Pneumonia

An infection of the lung parenchyma. Incidence of community-acquired pneumonia is 5-11 per 1000 adults. Of these, 1-3 per 1000 will require hospitalization, and mortality in those hospitalized is up to 14%.

## Common organisms
- Streptococcus pneumoniae is the commonest cause (60-75%).
- Haemophilus influenzae.
- Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
- Staphylococcus aureus found more commonly in ICU patients.
- Legionella species and Chlamydia psittaci.
- Gram-negative bacilli, often hospital-acquired or immunocompromised, eg Pseudomonas, especially in those with COPD.
- Viruses including influenza account for up to 15%.

## Symptoms
Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, purulent sputum (classically 'rusty' with pneumococcus), haemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain.

## Signs
Fever, cyanosis, herpes labialis (pneumococcus), confusion, tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (diminished expansion, dull percussion note, ↑ tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), pleural rub.

## Management
Ensure oxygenation then identify and treat reversible pathology, see fig 19.15.

## Investigations: Assess severity—this will guide both investigation and treatment.
- CXR (X-ray images, fig 16.4 on p725).
- Oxygen saturation and ABG if SaO₂ <92% or severe pneumonia.
- FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP.
- Blood cultures (if CURB-65 ≥2).
- Sputum cultures (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if CURB-65 =2 and not had antibiotics yet).
- Urine pneumococcal antigen (if CURB-65 ≥2); Legionella antigen (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if clinical suspicion).
- Consider need for viral throat swabs and mycoplasma PCR/serology.
- Pleural fluid may be aspirated for culture (if CURB-65 ≥2).
- Consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if the patient is immunocompromised or on ICU.

## Severity: Calculate the core adverse features 'CURB-65' score:
- Confusion (abbreviated mental test ≤8).
- Urea >7mmol/L.
- Respiratory rate ≥30/min.
- BP <90/60mmHg.
- Age ≥65.
Score: 0-1: home treatment if possible; ≥2: hospital therapy; ≥3: indicates severe pneumonia and should consider ICU referral.

Other features increasing the risk of death are: coexisting disease; bilateral/multilobar involvement; PaO₂ <8kPa or SaO₂ <92%.

## Treatment:
See antibiotic guidance (table 4.2 on p167). Most patients who require IV antibiotics can safely be switched to PO therapy by day 3.

## Complications (Of infection or treatment.)
Pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, respiratory failure, septicaemia, pericarditis, myocarditis, cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury.
