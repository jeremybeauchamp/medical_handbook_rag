# The cardiovascular system: examination 2

## General inspection
Ill or well? In pain? Dyspnoeic? Are they pale, cold, and clammy? Can you hear the click of a prosthetic valve? Inspect for scars: median sternotomy (CABG; valve replacement; congenital heart disease). Inspect for any pacemakers/internal cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). Look around the bed for oxygen and GTN spray.

## Hands
Finger clubbing occurs in congenital cyanotic heart disease and endocarditis. Splinter haemorrhages, Osler's nodes (tender nodules, eg in finger pulps) and Janeway lesions (red macules on palms, fig 3.38, p151) are signs of infective endocarditis. If found, examine the fundi for Roth's spots (retinal infarcts, p560). Are there nail fold infarcts (vasculitis, p556) or nailbed capillary pulsation (Quincke's sign in aortic regurgitation)? Is there arachnodactyly (Marfan's) or polydactyly (ASD)? Are there tendon xanthomata (see BOX 'Hyperlipidaemia')?

## Pulse
See p42. Feel for radio-femoral delay (coarctation of the aorta) and radio-radial delay (eg from aortic arch aneurysm).

## Blood pressure
(see BOX 'An unusual BP measurement') Systolic BP is the pressure at which the pulse is first heard as on cuff deflation (Korotkoff sounds); the diastolic is when the heart sounds disappear or become muffled (eg in the young). The pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures. It is narrow in aortic stenosis and hypovolaemia, and wide in aortic regurgitation, arteriosclerosis, and septic shock. Defining hypertension: see p138. Examine the fundi for hypertensive changes (p138). Shock may occur if systolic <90mmHg (p790). Postural hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic >20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg on standing for 3-5 min (see BOX 'Postural hypotension').

## Carotid pulse
(See p42.)

## Jugular venous pressure
(See p43.)

## Face
Is there corneal arcus (fig 2.7, p39) or xanthelasma (fig 2.29, p60, signifying dyslipidaemia, p690)? Is there a malar flush (mitral stenosis, low cardiac output)? Are there signs of Graves' disease, eg bulging eyes (exophthalmos) or goitre—p218)? Is the face dysmorphic, eg Down's syndrome, Marfan's syndrome (p706)—or Turner's, Noonan's, or Williams syndromes (p149)?

## Praecordium
Palpate the apex beat. Normal position: 5th intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Is it displaced laterally? Is it abnormal in nature: heaving (caused by outflow obstruction, eg aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension), thrusting (caused by volume overload, eg mitral or aortic incompetence), tapping (mitral stenosis, essentially a palpable 1st heart sound), diffuse (LV failure, dilated cardiomyopathy) or double impulse (H(O)CM, p152)? Is there dextrocardia? Feel for left parasternal heave (RV enlargement, eg in pulmonary stenosis, cor pulmonale, ASD) or thrills (transmitted murmurs).

## Auscultating the heart
Also auscultate for bruits over the carotids and elsewhere, particularly if there is inequality between pulses or absence of a pulse. Causes: atherosclerosis (elderly), vasculitis (young, p556).

## Lungs
Examine the bases for creps & pleural effusions, indicative of cardiac failure.

## Oedema
Examine the ankles, legs, sacrum, and torso for pitting oedema. (You may prefer to examine ankles while standing at the foot of the bed as it is a good early clue that there may be further pathology to be found.)

## Abdomen
Hepatomegaly and ascites in right-sided heart failure; pulsatile hepatomegaly with tricuspid regurgitation; splenomegaly with infective endocarditis.

## Fundoscopy
Roth spots (infective endocarditis).

## Urine dipstick
Haematuria.

## Presenting your findings

1. Signs of heart failure?
2. Clinical evidence of infective endocarditis?
3. Sinus/abnormal rhythm?
4. Heart sounds normal, abnormal, or additional?
5. Murmurs?
