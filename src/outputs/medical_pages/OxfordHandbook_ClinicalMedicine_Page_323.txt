## Prognosis

Acute rejection <15%, 1-year graft survival >90%. Longer-term graft loss ~4%/year.
Factors contributing to graft loss:
• Donor factors: age, comorbidity, living/deceased, DBD/DCD.
• Rejection.
• Infection.
• BP/CVD.
• Recurrent renal disease in graft.
Most common outcome is death with a functioning transplant (ie transplant 'out-
lives' the patient).

### When a patient with a renal transplant presents...

1. Discuss everything with the local renal transplant unit: they will be happy to
   advise, review, transfer, and follow-up any renal transplant recipient.
2. What is the eGFR/creatinine? How does that compare with previous results? If
   you do not have any, ask the transplant unit.
3. Examine for and treat any reversible cause of AKI. Fluid state assessment
   (p300) is important—if you are unsure, get expert help. Correction of volume
   depletion and treatment of any sepsis should be prompt.
4. Consider viral/opportunistic infections and atypical presentations due to im-
   munosuppression, eg CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii.
5. Do not stop any immunosuppressive medication. If the patient is unable to
   tolerate oral medication then immunosuppression must be given NG or convert-
   ed to an IV dose (conversion depends on drug: check with your pharmacist).
6. Check for medication interactions: macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin,
   clarithromycin) can cause calcineurin inhibitor toxicity.
7. Dose all drugs according to renal function: penicillins, cephalosporins, amino-
   glycosides, insulin, opiates, and low-molecular-weight heparin.
8. Check with the transplant unit before you give low-molecular-weight heparin
   for VTE prophylaxis: they may want to do a transplant biopsy.

### Thank you for life

It feels good to be able to put pen to paper at last and to thank you from the bot-
tom of my heart for the gift of life your daughter has given me and for the kindness
and compassion you have shown.... I want to say to you that it was a wonderful
thing that you did as a mother that in your deep sadness showed a caring and giv-
ing heart. I have a much better quality of life now since coming off dialysis 5 years
ago. My father died of kidney failure when I was 3 years old. He was someone I
would have loved to have known. I often think about your daughter, who she was
and what she was like. Despite not knowing her, I think about her with affection
and much respect. These last years must have been extremely painful for you all. I
really hope that you, your family and friends have found peace in your lives.

Love Deborah (renal transplant recipient, 1998)
