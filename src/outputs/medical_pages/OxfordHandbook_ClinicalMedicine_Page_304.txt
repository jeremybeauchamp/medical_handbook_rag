# 290 α1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency

A1AT deficiency is an inherited disorder affecting lung (emphysema) and liver (cirrhosis and HCC). A1AT is a glycoprotein and one of a family of serine protease inhibitors made in the liver that control inflammatory cascades. Deficiency is called a serpinopathy. It makes up 90% of serum α1-globulin on electrophoresis (p687). A1AT deficiency is the chief genetic cause of liver disease in children. In adults, its lack is more likely to cause emphysema. Lung A1AT protects against tissue damage from neutrophil elastase—a process that is also induced by cigarette smoking (p184). Prevalence ~1:4000 (higher in Caucasians).

## Genetics
Genetic variants of A1AT are typed by electrophoretic mobility as medium (M), slow (S), or very slow (Z). S and Z types are due to single amino acid substitutions at positions 264 and 342, respectively. These result in ↓production of α1-antitrypsin (S=60%, Z=15%). The normal genotype is PiMM, the high risk homozygote is PiZZ; heterozygotes are PiMZ and PiSZ (at low risk of developing liver disease).

## The patient
Symptomatic patients usually have the PiZZ genotype: dyspnoea from emphysema; cirrhosis; cholestatic jaundice. Cholestasis often remits in adolescence.

## Tests
Serum α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) levels ↓, usually (eg <11μmol/L or <75% of lower limit of normal, which is ~0.9g/L; labs vary). Note the 'usually'. Because A1AT is part of the acute-phase response, inflammation may hide a low level. Unless you do genotyping, you will inevitably mis-label some cirrhosis as cryptogenic. Lung function testing: Shows reductions in FEV1 with obstructive pattern (p162). There may be some bronchodilator reversibility. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) +ve; diastase-resistant globules. Phenotyping: By isoelectric focusing requires expertise to distinguish SZ and ZZ phenotypes. Phenotyping can miss null phenotypes. Prenatal diagnosis: Possible by DNA analysis of chorionic villus samples obtained at 11–13wks' gestation.

## Management
Smoking cessation. Prompt treatment/preventative vaccination for lung infections. Giving IV A1AT pooled from human plasma is expensive but COPD exacerbations may be prevented (no good randomized trials). Liver transplantation: Needed in decompensated cirrhosis. Lung transplantation: Improves survival and has a comparable survival to transplantation in non-A1AT-deficient COPD. Inhaled A1AT: Has been tried in lung disease.

## Prognosis
Some patients have life-threatening symptoms in childhood, whereas others remain asymptomatic and healthy into old age. Worse prognosis if male, a smoker, or obese. Emphysema is the cause of death in most, liver disease in ~5%. In adults, cirrhosis ± HCC affect 25% of A1AT-deficient adults >50yrs.
