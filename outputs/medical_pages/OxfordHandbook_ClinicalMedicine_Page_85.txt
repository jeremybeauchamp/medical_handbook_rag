# Causes of cranial nerve lesions

Any cranial nerve may be affected by diabetes mellitus; stroke; MS; tumours; sarcoidosis; vasculitis (p556), eg PAN (p556), SLE (p554); syphilis. Chronic meningitis (malignant, TB, or fungal) tends to pick off the lower cranial nerves one by one.

- **I**: Trauma; respiratory tract infection; meningitis; frontal lobe tumour.
- **II**: Field defects may start as small areas of visual loss (scotomas, eg in glaucoma).
  *Monocular blindness*—lesions of one eye or optic nerve eg MS, giant cell arteritis.
  *Bilateral blindness*⁴—any cause of mononeuritis, eg diabetes, MS; rarely methanol,
  neurosyphilis. *Field defects*—*bitemporal hemianopia*—optic chiasm compression, eg pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, internal carotid artery aneurysm
  (fig 10.3, p451). *Homonymous hemianopia*—affects half the visual field contralateral to the lesion in each eye. Lesions lie beyond the chiasm in the tracts, radiation,
  or occipital cortex, eg stroke, abscess, tumour. *Optic neuritis* (pain on moving
  eye, loss of central vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, disc swelling from
  papillitis⁵)—causes demyelination (eg MS); rarely sinusitis, syphilis, collagen vascular disorders. *Ischaemic papillopathy*—swelling of optic disc due to stenosis
  of the posterior ciliary artery (eg in giant cell arteritis). *Papilloedema* (bilaterally swollen discs, fig 12.20, p560)—most commonly ↑ICP (tumour, abscess, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension); rarer: retro-orbital
  lesion (eg cavernous sinus thrombosis, p480). *Optic atrophy* (pale optic discs
  and reduced acuity)—MS; frontal tumours; Friedreich's ataxia; retinitis pigmentosa; syphilis; glaucoma; Leber's optic atrophy; chronic optic nerve compression.
- **III**:ᶜ *Alone*—'medical' causes (pupillary sparing): diabetes; HTN; giant cell arteritis; syphilis; idiopathic. 'Surgical' causes (early pupil involvement due to external
  compression of nerve damaging parasympathetic fibres): posterior communicating artery aneurysm (± surgery) ↑ICP (if uncal herniation through the tentorium compresses the nerve); tumours.
- **IV**:ᶜ *Alone*—rare and usually due to trauma to the orbit.
- **V**:ᶜ *Sensory*—trigeminal neuralgia (pain but no sensory loss, p457); herpes zoster,
  nasopharyngeal cancer, acoustic neuroma (p462). *Motor*—rare.
- **VI**:ᶜ *Alone*—MS, Wernicke's encephalopathy, false localizing sign in ↑ICP, pontine
  stroke (presents with fixed small pupils ± quadriparesis).
- **VII**: *LMN*—Bell's palsy (p500), polio, otitis media, skull fracture; cerebellopontine
  angle tumours, eg acoustic neuroma, malignant parotid tumours, herpes zoster
  (Ramsay Hunt syndrome p501, OHCS p652). *UMN*—(spares the forehead, because
  of its bilateral cortical representation), stroke, tumour.
- **VIII**: (p462 & p464.) Noise damage, Paget's disease, Ménière's disease, herpes
  zoster, acoustic neuroma, brainstem CVA, drugs (eg aminoglycosides).
- **IX, X, XI**: Trauma, brainstem lesions, neck tumours.
- **XII**: Rare. Polio, syringomyelia, tumour, stroke, bulbar palsy, trauma, TB.

**Groups of cranial nerves:**

VIII, then V, VI, IX, & X: cerebellopontine angle tumours, eg acoustic neuroma (p462;
facial weakness is not a prominent sign). III, IV & VI: stroke, tumours, Wernicke's
encephalopathy; aneurysms, MS. III, IV, Vₐ, & VI: cavernous sinus thrombosis, superior orbital fissure lesions (Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, OHCS p654). IX, X, & XI: jugular
foramen lesion. All: myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy,
mononeuritis multiplex (p502).

## Top tips

If the patient is able to shake their head, there is no meningism.

4 Remember the commonest cause of monocular or binocular blindness is not a cranial nerve lesion but
a problem with the eye itself (cataracts, retinal problems). Neurological disorders more commonly cause
loss of part of the visual field.

5 Unilateral disc swelling = papillitis, bilateral papillitis/disc swelling = papilloedema. Check both eyes!

ᶜ= structures passing through the cavernous sinus; see BOX 'Psychiatric symptoms', p89. NB: Vₐ is the only
division of V to do so.

ᵖ= Remember that these cranial nerves carry parasympathetic fibres. Sympathetic fibres originate from
the thoracic chain and run with the arterial supply to distribute about the body (see also OHCS, fig 9.6, p621).
