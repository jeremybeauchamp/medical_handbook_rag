# Diagnostic taps

If you are unsure whether a drain is needed, a diagnostic tap can be helpful. Whatever fluid you are sampling, a green needle carries far less risk than a formal drain. It also allows you to decide whether a drain is required.

Ascites may be sampled to give a cytological or bacterial diagnosis, eg to exclude spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP; p276). Before starting, know the patient's platelets + clotting times. If they are abnormal, seek help before proceeding.

- Place the patient flat and tap out the ascites, marking a point where fluid has been identified, avoiding vessels, stomas, and scars (adhesions to the anterior abdominal wall). The left side may be safer—less chance of nicking liver (fig 18.5).
- Clean the skin. Infiltrate some local anaesthetic, eg 1% lidocaine (see p573).
- Insert a 21G needle on a 20mL syringe into the skin and advance while aspirating until fluid is withdrawn, try to obtain 60mL of fluid.
- Remove the needle, apply a sterile dressing.
- Send fluid to microbiology (15mL) for microscopy and culture, biochemistry (5mL for protein, see p192), and cytology (40mL). Call microbiology to forewarn them if urgent analysis of the specimen is required.

## Diagnostic aspiration of a pleural effusion

- If not yet done, a CXR may help evaluate the side and size of the effusion.
- Ideally use US guidance at the bedside (↑ chance of successful aspirate and ↓ chance of organ puncture). If this is unavailable, ask an ultrasonographer to mark a spot, or percuss the upper border of the pleural effusion and choose a site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (usually posteriorly or laterally).
- Clean the area around the marked spot with 2% chlorhexidine solution.
- Infiltrate down to the pleura with 5-10mL of 1% lidocaine.
- Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of the rib below the mark to avoid the neurovascular bundle (fig 18.6). Aspirate whilst advancing the needle. Draw off 10-30mL of pleural fluid. Send fluid to the lab for chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH); bacteriology (microscopy and culture, auramine stain, TB culture); cytology, and, if indicated, amylase and immunology (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, complement).
- If you cannot obtain fluid with a 21G needle, seek help.
- If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.
