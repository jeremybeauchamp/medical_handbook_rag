# Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: the darkest hour

In paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), surface proteins are missing in all blood cells due to a somatic mutation in the X-linked PIG-A gene. Cells lack the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that binds the surface proteins to cell membranes. This causes uncontrolled amplification of the complement system and leads to destruction of the RBC membrane and release of haemoglobin into the circulation (fig 15.8). NB: the phenomenom of haemoglobinuria³ is not all that reliable. A much better test even than a marrow biopsy (right-hand panel, showing a clone of PNH cells) is flow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored proteins on peripheral blood cells. This can determine the size of the PNH clone and type of GPI deficiency (complete or partial). ℞: Most benefit from supportive measures—but allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 protein of the complement system. Blockade prevents activation of the complement distal pathway, reducing haemolysis, stabilizing haemoglobin, and reducing transfusion requirements.⁵⁴

³ In haemoglobinuria, urine dipstick will be positive for blood but microscopy of urine does not show RBCs (thus differentiating it from haematuria, but not myoglobinuria—where CK ± AST will be high).
