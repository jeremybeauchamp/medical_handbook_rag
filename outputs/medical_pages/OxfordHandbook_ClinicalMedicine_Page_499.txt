## Delirium vs dementia

One is often mistaken for the other, yet perhaps the interconnectedness of these two conditions is greater than we realize: not only is dementia the leading risk factor for delirium, but delirium itself confers a greater risk of subsequently developing dementia. It is likely that this is due to a number of factors: delirium is a marker of vulnerability of the brain, and may also emphasize previously unrecognized dementia symptoms. Furthermore, there may be direct causation through the noxious insults incurred during an episode of delirium, which can lead to permanent neuronal damage.

In distinguishing the two conditions (not always an easy task) the presence of inattention, distractibility, and disorganized thinking will all point you towards delirium. But the fundamental question is 'Has there been an acute change from the patient's cognitive baseline?' Family or carer collateral reports are invaluable, but may not always be available. Document cognition in all patients >65y admitted to hospital (eg AMTs, p64, many admission proformas allow for this). This will then allow you to compare their admission score with subsequent assessments and track any improvements, deteriorations, or fluctuations in cognition throughout the admission.
