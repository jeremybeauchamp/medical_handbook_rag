## Bacterial infection: an overview

Humans and bacteria are symbiotes, with each of us host to ten times as many bacterial cells as our own human cells. Our gut, skin, and mucosal linings are covered with bacteria. We rely on this for nutrition, functioning vitamin K, anti-inflammatory effects, and immune system regulation.

Bacterial disease results from a breach of the measures that limit bacteria to their 'normal' roles: skin commensals moved into the bloodstream by a cannula, antibiotics altering the commensal microflora, immune system evasion or dysfunction allowing organisms to stray beyond their usual boundaries, toxin production. When treating infections we should therefore remember to look beyond the offending organism and consider what factors may have aided pathogenesis: malnutrition, 'barrier' breach by cancer/plastic, immunosuppression.

### Bacterial glossary

**Bacteria:** Prokaryotic micro-organism without a membrane-bound nucleus.

**Classification of bacteria:** By microscopy and culture of infected samples. Informs antibiotic choice. Includes:

- **Gram stain:** a staining technique. Bacteria with thick, exposed peptidoglycan layers will stain 'Gram positive' (purple/blue). Bacteria with a protected peptidoglycan layer will counterstain pink/red and are 'Gram negative' (fig 9.3).
- **Shape:** cocci = round; bacilli = rod-shaped; spirochaete = spiral.
- **Aerobes/anaerobes:** some bacteria cannot survive without oxygen (obligate aerobes), whilst others cannot grow in its presence (obligate anaerobes). Many more can survive in either environment (facultative anaerobes). Some types of infection are more likely to involve aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, eg GI infections are typically anaerobic.

**Bacteraemia:** Bacteria circulating in the bloodstream.

**Bacteriocidal:** Kills bacteria both in and out of the replication cycle.

**Bacteriostatic:** Stops replication without killing existing bacteria.

**Capsulate bacteria:** Bacteria with a thick outer capsule, eg Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These are destroyed in the spleen. Following splenectomy (or splenic infarction, eg sickle cell anaemia) there is an increased risk of infection by capsulate bacteria and prophylactic vaccination should be offered (p407).

**Commensal:** An organism that lives in/on a host without causing harm.

**Endotoxin:** A lipopolysaccharide complex found on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Can elicit an inflammatory response. Activates complement via the alternative pathway.

**Enterotoxin:** Exotoxin that targets the gut, eg Clostridium difficile toxin (p411).

**Exotoxin:** Toxins secreted by bacteria acting at a site distant from bacterial growth. Production of an exotoxin can determine virulence, eg botulinum, tetanus, diphtheria, shiga toxins.

**Flagella:** A tail-like appendage that moves to propel the bacterium, eg Helicobacter pylori.

**Nosocomial:** Acquired in a hospital/healthcare setting (pp410-1).

**Obligate intracellular:** Bacteria that can only survive in host cells âˆ´ induce a cell-mediated immune response and will not grow on standard culture media.

**Ziehl-Neelsen stain:** Mycolic acid in the cell wall of mycobacteria resists Gram staining but will appear red with acid-fast techniques (= acid-fast stain).
