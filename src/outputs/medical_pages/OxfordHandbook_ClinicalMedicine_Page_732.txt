Fig 16.1 The first X-ray, taken by Wilhelm Röntgen of his wife's hand (for which he won the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901). Upon seeing the ghostly image she cried 'I have seen my death!' Could this exclamation have prophesized the radiation-induced malignancies that have plagued the recipients (and administrators) of X-rays since their conception (see BOX)? Despite the obvious commercial potential, Röntgen declined to take out any patents on his new technology, preferring to see it developed for the benefit of humanity. Fate did not repay this generosity: his personal wealth depreciated away in the German hyperinflation of the 1920s, and he spent his later years in bankruptcy.
