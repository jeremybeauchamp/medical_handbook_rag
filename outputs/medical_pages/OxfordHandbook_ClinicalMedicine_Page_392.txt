**Fig 9.1 Leeuwenhoek's microscope.** Antoni van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was an unlikely scholar: a draper with no academic education. He mixed uncomfortably in a scientific world made up of those better educated, wealthier, and with more refined manners. He felt unworthy of publication but submitted hundreds of letters to the Royal Society, always asking his readers to account for his humble origins. Despite his self-deprecation, his microscopy was sophisticated. His surviving lens magnified ≈266 and resolved down to 1.35μm, comparable to that of a modern compound microscope. With it he gained one of the first insights into the 'invisible' living creatures of the microscopic world. His microscopes were cheap and easy to produce—he made 500 for his personal use. He plated them in gold and silver to add a prestige that the scientific world felt they lacked. But that world failed to see beyond the end of its turned up nose. Bloodletting, purging, and emetics would continue to fail patients for a further 150 years.
