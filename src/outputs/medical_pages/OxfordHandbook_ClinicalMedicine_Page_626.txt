# Abdominal hernias

**Definition** The protrusion of a viscus or part of a viscus through a defect of the walls of its containing cavity into an abnormal position. See fig 13.31. *Terminology:*
• *Irreducible:* contents cannot be pushed back into place (see p614 for technique).
• *Obstructed:* bowel contents cannot pass—features of intestinal obstruction (p610).
• *Strangulated:* ischaemia occurs—the patient requires urgent surgery.
• *Incarceration:* contents of the hernial sac are stuck inside by adhesions.
Care must be taken with reduction as it is possible to push an incarcerated hernia back into the abdominal cavity, giving the initial appearance of successful reduction.

**Inguinal hernia** The commonest type in both ♂ & ♀ (but ♂>>♀), p614.

**Femoral hernia** Bowel enters the femoral canal, presenting as a mass in the upper medial thigh or above the inguinal ligament where it points down the leg, unlike an inguinal hernia which points to the groin. They occur more often in ♀ especially in middle age and the elderly. They are likely to be irreducible and to strangulate due to the rigidity of the canal's borders. *Anatomy:* See fig 13.32 *Differential diagnosis:* (See p651.) 1 Inguinal hernia. 2 Saphena varix. 3 An enlarged Cloquet's node (p615). 4 Lipoma. 5 Femoral aneurysm. 6 Psoas abscess. *Treatment:* Surgical repair is recommended. Herniotomy is ligation and excision of the sac, herniorrhaphy is repair of the hernial defect.

**Paraumbilical hernias** occur just above or below the umbilicus. Risk factors are obesity and ascites. Omentum or bowel herniates through the defect. Surgery involves repair of the rectus sheath (Mayo repair).

**Epigastric hernias** pass through linea alba above the umbilicus.

**Incisional hernias** follow breakdown of muscle closure after surgery (11-20%). If obese, repair is not easy. Mesh repair has recurrence but infection over sutures.

**Spigelian hernias** occur through the linea semilunaris at the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, below and lateral to the umbilicus.

**Lumbar hernias** occur through the inferior or superior lumbar triangles in the posterior abdominal wall.

**Richter's hernias** involve bowel wall only—not the whole lumen.

**Maydl's hernias** involve a herniating 'double loop' of bowel. The strangulated portion may reside as a single loop inside the abdominal cavity.

**Littré's hernias** are hernial sacs containing strangulated Meckel's diverticulum.

**Obturator hernias** occur through the obturator canal. Typically there is pain along the medial side of the thigh in a thin woman.

**Sciatic hernias** pass through the lesser sciatic foramen (a way through various pelvic ligaments). GI obstruction + a gluteal mass suggests this rare possibility.

**Sliding hernias** contain a partially extraperitoneal structure (eg caecum on the right, sigmoid colon on the left). The sac does not completely surround the contents.

**Paediatric hernias** include *Umbilical hernias:* (3% of live births). Are a result of a persistent defect in the transversalis fascia. Surgical repair rarely needed as most resolve by the age of 3. *Indirect inguinal hernias* (~4% of all ♂ infants due to patent processus vaginalis—prematurity is a risk factor; uncommon in ♀ infants—consider testicular feminization.) Surgical repair is required. *Gastroschisis:* Protrusion of the abdominal contents through a defect in the anterior abdominal wall to the right of the umbilicus. Prompt surgical repair required. *Exomphalos:* Abdominal contents are found outside the abdomen, covered in a three-layer membrane consisting of peritoneum, Wharton's jelly, and amnion. Surgical repair less urgent because the bowel is protected by these membranes.
