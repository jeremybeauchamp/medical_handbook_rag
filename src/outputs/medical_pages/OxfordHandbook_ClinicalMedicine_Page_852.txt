# Acute poisoning—general measures

**Diagnosis** Mainly from the history. The patient may not tell the truth about what has been taken. If there are any tablets with the patient, use MIMS Colour Index, EMIMS images, BNF descriptions, or the computerized system 'TICTAC' (ask pharmacy) to identify tablets and plan specific treatment.

**TOXBASE** The best resource for managing acute poisoning: www.toxbase.org—check with your Emergency Department about log-in details for your hospital.

**Clues** May become apparent from examination:
- Fast or irregular pulse: Salbutamol, antimuscarinics, tricyclics, quinine, or phenothiazine poisoning.
- Respiratory depression: Opiate (p842) or benzodiazepine (p842) toxicity.
- Hypothermia: Phenothiazines (p843), barbiturates.
- Hyperthermia: Amphetamines, MAOIs, cocaine, or ecstasy (p843).
- Coma: Benzodiazepines, alcohol, opiates, tricyclics, or barbiturates.
- Seizures: Recreational drugs, hypoglycaemic agents, tricyclics, phenothiazines, or theophyllines.
- Constricted pupils: Opiates (p842) or insecticides (organophosphates, p843).
- Dilated pupils: Amphetamines, cocaine, quinine, or tricyclics.
- Hyperglycaemia: Organophosphates, theophyllines, or MAOIs.
- Hypoglycaemia: (p834) Insulin, oral hypoglycaemics, alcohol, or salicylates.
- Renal impairment: Salicylate (p844), paracetamol (p844), or ethylene glycol.
- Metabolic acidosis: Alcohol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paracetamol, or carbon monoxide poisoning (p842).
- ↑Osmolality: Alcohols (ethyl or methyl); ethylene glycol. See p668.

**Management** ▶See fig 19.25.
- Take blood as appropriate (p840). Always check paracetamol and salicylate levels.
- Empty stomach if appropriate (p840).
- Consider specific antidote (p842) or oral activated charcoal (p840).
- If you are not familiar with the poison get more information. Toxbase (www.toxbase.org) should be your first thought. If no information here or in doubt how best to act, phone the Poisons Information Service: in the UK phone 0844 892 0111.

**Continuing care** Measure temperature, pulse, BP, and blood glucose regularly. Keep on cardiac monitor. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone, turn regularly. Catherize if the bladder is distended, or acute kidney injury (p298) is suspected, or forced diuresis undertaken. Consider ICU, eg if ↓respiration.

**Psychiatric assessment** Be sympathetic despite the hour! Interview relatives and friends if possible. Aim to establish:
- Intentions at time. Was this a suicide attempt, if so was the act planned? What precautions against being found? Did the patient seek help afterwards? Does the patient think the method was dangerous? Was there a final act (eg suicide note)?
- Present intentions. Do they still feel suicidal? Do they wish it had worked?
- What problems led to the act: do they still exist?
- Is there a psychiatric disorder (depression, alcoholism, personality disorder, schizophrenia, dementia)?
- What are the patient's resources (friends, family, work, personality)?

The assessment of suicide risk: The following ↑ chance of future suicide: original intention was to die; present intention is to die; presence of psychiatric disorder; poor resources; previous suicide attempts; socially isolated; unemployed; male; >50yrs old. See OHCS p358. There is ↑risk of death in the first year following initial presentation.

**Referral to psychiatrist:** This depends partly on local resources. Refer all with presence of psychiatric disorder or high suicide risk. Consider discussing all presentations with deliberate self-poisoning.

**Mental Capacity Act or the Mental Health Act:** (In England and Wales) may provide for the detention of the patient against his or her will: see OHCS p406.
