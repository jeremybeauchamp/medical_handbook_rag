# Managing death

Death may be regarded as a medical failure rather than an inevitable consequence of life. But when medical treatments can no longer offer a cure, and a patient enters the end of life, active management of death is vital. Remember that the focus of medicine is narrow and concerned more with the repair of health, rather than the sustenance of the soul. This medical imperative may fail in its duty to make life-in-death better. Priorities at the end of life include freedom from pain, achieving a sense of completeness, being treated as a whole person, and finding peace with God.

Swift death due to a catastrophic event is rare. Most death is the end product of a struggle with long-term, progressive disease: cancer, COPD, vascular disease, neurological deterioration, frailty, or dementia. Although death is inevitable, prognostication is difficult and inaccurate with remarkable variation in time to death. The patient in front of you may be the median, mean, or on the 99th centile. Dare to hope, but prepare for the worst. Prioritize preferences and aim to meet individual needs.

- Seek help from experienced members of staff including palliative care teams.
- Elicit needs: physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual. Discuss fears.
- Establish the wishes of the patient. What trade-offs are they willing to accept, eg treatment toxicity for potential time gained? What is unacceptable to them?
- Consider the views of those important to the patient.
- Hydration: give support to allow the dying to drink, offer mouth care. Consider clinically assisted hydration (parenteral, enteral, intravenous) according to wishes and if distressing signs/symptoms of dehydration are possible. Stop according to wishes and harm.
- Manage pain promptly and effectively. Treat any reversible causes of pain.
- Consider a syringe pump if symptom control medications are required more than twice in 24 hours (see p536).
- Anticipate likely symptoms: the PRN side of the drug chart should cover all possibilities (see p536).

Death may or may not come with peace and acceptance. Patients may rage mightily against the dying of the light. Bear witness for them: listen and hold their hand.

## Organ donation

Over 6000 people are waiting for an organ transplant in the UK and approximately 1000 people in need of a transplant will die each year (see p308).

Any patient who is a potential donor can be referred to a specialist organ donation service. That service will provide advice as to suitability for transplantation and will coordinate the approach to families. They are contactable 24 hours a day and their details will be held in your A&E and/or ITU departments.

Organs can be retrieved from:
- donor after brainstem death or heart-beating donor.
- donor after cardiac death or non-heart-beating donor. Includes death following unsuccessful CPR and patients for whom death is inevitable but do not meet the criteria for brainstem death.

There are two legislative frameworks for organ donation:
- Opt-in. Donors give their explicit consent
- Opt-out. Anyone who has not actively refused consent is a donor.

The association between an opt-out system and higher organ donation rates is complicated by the presence of multiple cofounding factors. Non-legislative change including national coordination, support and training of clinicians, routine discussion as part of end-of-life care, and efficient organ retrieval also increase donation rates. The ethics of presumed consent should also be considered: the absence of an objection would not be an acceptable substitute for informed consent in other areas of clinical practice.

In the UK, although consent for transplantation rests with the deceased, if the patient's family or representative cannot support donation then it will not go ahead. Register your decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register (https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/register-your-details/) and more importantly, let your family know your wishes.
