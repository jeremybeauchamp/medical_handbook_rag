# Laboratory results: when to take action NOW

- On receiving a dangerous result, first check the name and date.
- Go to the bedside. If the patient is conscious, turn off any IVI (until fluid is checked: a mistake may have been made) and ask the patient how he or she is. Any fits, faints, collapses, or unexpected symptoms?
- Be sceptical of an unexpectedly, wildly abnormal result with a well patient. Compare with previous values. Could the specimens have got muddled up; whose is it? Is there an artefact? Was the sample taken from the 'drip' arm? Is a low calcium due to a low albumin (p676)? Perhaps the lab is using a new analyser with a faulty wash cycle? When in doubt, seek help and repeat the test.

The following values are somewhat arbitrary and must be taken as a guide only. Many results less extreme than those listed will be just as dangerous if the patient is old, immunosuppressed, or has some other pathology such as pneumonia.

## Plasma biochemistry:
The main risks when plasma electrolytes are dangerously abnormal (table 14.3) are of cardiac arrhythmias and CNS events such as seizures.

Table 14.3 Dangerous levels of the common serum electrolytes

| Electrolyte    | Lower limit  | Upper limit  | Relevant pages |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Na+            | <120mmol/L   | >155mmol/L   | p672           |
| K+             | <2.5mmol/L   | >6.5mmol/L   | p674, p301     |
| Corrected Ca2+ | <2.0mmol/L   | >3.5mmol/L   | p676, p678     |
| Glucose        | <2.0mmol/L   | >20mmol/L    | p832, p834     |

## Blood gases:
- PaO2 <8.0kPa = Severe hypoxia. Give O2. See p188.
- pH <7.1 = Dangerous acidosis. See p670 to determine the cause.

## Haematology results:
- Hb <70g/L with low mean cell volume (<75fL) or history of bleeding. This patient may need urgent transfusion (no spare capacity)—ask about symptoms, co-morbidities, and baseline Hb. Check haematinics before transfusion. See p324.
- Platelets <40×109/L. May need a platelet transfusion; call a haematologist.
- Plasmodium falciparum seen on blood film. Start antimalarials now. See p418.
- ESR >30mm/h + headache. Could there be giant cell arteritis? See p556.

## CSF results:
Never delay treatment when bacterial meningitis is suspected.
- >1 neutrophil/mm3. Is there meningitis: usually >1000 neutrophils? See p822.
- Positive Gram stain. Talk to a microbiologist; urgent blind therapy. See p822.
