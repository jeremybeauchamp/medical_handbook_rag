# 244 Healthy, enjoyable eating

> 'There's a lot of people in this world who spend so much time watching their health that they haven't the time to enjoy it.' Josh Billings (1818-85).

Updates to guidelines on healthy eating perhaps provide fodder for journalists who have been served a diet both rich and varied in apparently contradictory advice. Nonetheless, for many of our increasingly overweight population, simply eating less (eg 2500 calories/d for men and 2000 for women) and balancing intake across food groups seems a sensible start. Diet is of course not independent of lifestyle, and we should continue to promote a balanced diet in the context of the full range of public health messages. Unravelling these confounding threads in population-level data will always pose a challenge—while some studies show vegetarians may be less likely to die from ischaemic heart disease, is this effect because vegetarians in the UK are more likely to be non-smokers? Overly proscriptive application of such population-level data in advice given to individuals (as journalists may be prone to do) will always be flawed and risks drowning important fundamental concepts in a sea of cynicism.

## Current recommendations must take into account three facts
- Obesity costs health services as much as smoking—1 in 4 UK adults is obese.
- Diabetes mellitus is burgeoning: in some places prevalence is >7% (p206).
- Past advice has not changed eating habits in large sections of the population.

## Advice is likely to focus on the following

**Body mass index:** (BMI; table 6.1.) Aim for 18.5-25. Controlling quantity may be more important than quality. In hypertension, eating the 'right' things lowers BP only marginally, but controlling weight causes a more significant reduction.

**Base meals on starch:** (Bread, rice, potatoes, pasta.) These provide a slower release form of carbohydrate compared to diets containing refined sugar, and beware of the high sugar contents of, eg soft drinks.

**Eat enough fruit and vegetables:** Aiming for 5 portions a day.

**Eat foods high in fat, salt, or sugar infrequently.**

**Eat some meat, fish, eggs, and beans:** Aim for 2 portions of fish a week, including oily fish (those rich in omega-3 fatty acid, such as mackerel, herring, pilchards, salmon). Non-dairy sources of protein include beans and nuts. Aim to reduce intake of red or processed meat to <70g/day.

**Eat some milk and dairy products:** Select those options with lower fat, sugar and salt where possible.

**Moderate alcohol use (adults <65yrs):** ≤14U/wk for both men and women, spread over 3 or more days. There is no 'safe' level.

**Supplements:** There is scant evidence for most nutritional supplements in those able to follow a balanced diet. Women attempting to conceive should take 400mcg/day folic acid from (pre-)conception until at least 12wks. Vitamin D supplements (10mcg/day) may benefit breast-feeding mothers, those ≥65yrs old, those whose skin is not typically exposed to sun, or those with very dark skin. Lower doses may be recommended for infants and young children.

**This diet is not appropriate for all:** • <5yrs old. • Need for low residue (eg Crohn's, UC, p264) or special diet (coeliac disease, p266). Emphasis may be different in: Dyslipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); obesity; constipation (p260); liver failure (p274); chronic pancreatitis (p270); renal failure (less protein)(p304); IBP (see p140).

**Difficulties** It is an imposition to ask us to change our diet (children often refuse point-blank); a more subtle approach is to take a food we enjoy (crisps) and make it healthier (eg low-salt crisps made from jacket potatoes and fried in sunflower oil).
