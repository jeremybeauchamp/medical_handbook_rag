# 592 Minimally invasive and day case surgery

Laparoscopy was developed within gynaecology and is now in widespread use for diagnostic purposes and surgical procedures such as appendicectomy, fundoplication, splenectomy, adrenalectomy, hernia repair, colectomy, prostatectomy, and nephrectomy. Minimally invasive surgery is also used for thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy.

As a rule of thumb, whatever can be done by laparotomy can also be done with the laparoscope. This does not mean that it should be done, but if the surgeon is adequately trained, and the patient feels better sooner, has less post-operative pain, can return to work earlier, and has fewer complications, then there are obvious advantages. Pre-procedure counselling should always discuss the complications of laparoscopic surgery (eg accidental damage to other intra-abdominal organs) as well as the risk of conversion to an open procedure.

## Challenges of minimal access surgery
The 2-dimensional visual representation and different surgical approach alters the normal appearance of familiar anatomy. Palpation is impossible and it may be harder to locate lesions prior to resection. As a result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be learned and taught.

## Day-case surgery
Advances in surgical techniques as well as perioperative care mean better results for the patient (shorter waiting lists, fewer infections, fewer days off work, and patient satisfaction). Many operations can now be performed as day cases. Theoretically any procedure is suitable, provided the time under general anaesthetic does not exceed ~1h. The use of regional anaesthesia helps to avoid the SE of nausea and disorientation that may accompany a general anaesthetic, thus facilitating discharge.

Bear in mind that the following groups of patients may not be suitable for day-case surgery:
- Severe dementia.
- Severe learning difficulties.
- Living alone (and no helpers).
- Children if supervision difficult—changes in expectation, delays, and pain relief can be problematic.
- BMI >32 (p244).
- ASA category ≥III (p567) thus potentially unstable comorbidities—discuss with the anaesthetist.
- Infection at the site of the operation.

## Exposing patients to our learning curves? The jury is still out...

All surgeons get better over time (for a while), as they perform new techniques with increasing ease and confidence. When Wertheim did his first hysterectomies, his first dozen patients died—but then one survived. He assumed it was a good operation, and pressed ahead. He was a brave man, and thousands of women owe their lives to him. But had he tried to do this today, he would have been stopped. The UK's General Medical Council (GMC) and other august bodies tell us that we must protect the public by reporting doctors whose patients have low survival rates. The reason for this is partly ethical, and partly to preserve self-regulation.

We have the toughest codes of practice and disciplinary procedures of any group of workers. It is assumed that doctors are loyal to each other out of self-interest, and that this loyalty is bad. This has never been tested formally, and is not evidence-based. We can imagine two clinical worlds: one of constant 'reportings' and recriminatory audits, and another of trust and team-work. Both are imperfect, but we should not assume that the first world would be better for our patients.

When patients are sick with fear, they do not, perhaps, want to know everything. We may tell to protect ourselves. We may not tell to protect ourselves. Perhaps what we should do is, in our hearts, appeal to those 12 dead women-of-Wertheim—a jury as infallible as sacrificial—and try to hear their reply. And to those who complain that in doing so we are playing God, it is possible to reply with some humility that, whatever it is, it does not seem like play.
