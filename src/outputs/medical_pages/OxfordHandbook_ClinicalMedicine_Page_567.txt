# Plasma autoantibodies (Abs): disease associations

> Always interpret in the context of clinical findings: Different antibodies have different disease associations.

## Rheumatological: Rheumatoid factor (RhF) positive in:

| Condition | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Sjögren's syndrome | ≤100% |
| Felty's syndrome | ≤100% |
| RA | 70% |
| Infection (SBE/IE; hepatitis) | ≤50% |
| Mixed connective tissue disease | 50% |
| SLE | ≤40% |
| Systemic sclerosis | 30% |
| Normal | 2-10% |

Anticyclic citrullinated peptide Ab (anti-CCP): rheumatoid arthritis (~96% specificity)

## Antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive by immunofluorescence in:

| Condition | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| SLE | >95% |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | 75% |
| Sjögren's syndrome | 68% |
| Systemic sclerosis | 96% |
| RA | 30% |
| Normal | 0-2% |

ANA titres are expressed according to dilutions at which antibodies can be detected, ie 1:160 means antibodies can still be detected after the serum has been diluted 160 times. Titres of 1:40 or 1:80 may not be significant. The pattern of staining may indicate the disease (although these are not specific):

- Homogeneous: SLE
- Speckled: Mixed CT disease
- Nucleolar: Systemic sclerosis
- Centromere: Limited systemic sclerosis

Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA): SLE (60% sensitivity, but highly specific).
Antihistone Ab: drug-induced SLE (~100%).
Antiphospholipid Ab (eg anti-cardiolipin Ab): antiphospholipid syndrome, SLE.
Anticentromere Ab: limited systemic sclerosis.

## Anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies (usually with +ve ANA):

- Anti-Ro (SSA): SLE, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis. Associated with congenital heart block.
- Anti-La (SSB): Sjögren's syndrome, SLE (15%).
- Anti-Sm: SLE (20-30%).
- Anti-RNP: SLE, mixed connective tissue disease.
- Anti Jo-1; Anti-Mi-2: Polymyositis, dermatomyositis.
- Anti-Scl70: Diffuse systemic sclerosis.

## Gastrointestinal: (For liver autoantibodies, see p284.)

Antimitochondrial Ab (AMA): primary biliary cholangitis (>95%), autoimmune hepatitis (30%), idiopathic cirrhosis (25-30%).

Anti-smooth muscle Ab (SMA): autoimmune hepatitis (70%), primary biliary cholangitis (50%), idiopathic cirrhosis (25-30%).

Gastric parietal cell Ab: pernicious anaemia (>90%), atrophic gastritis (40%), 'normal' (10%).

Intrinsic factor Ab: pernicious anaemia (50%).

α-gliadin Ab, antitissue transglutaminase, anti-endomysial Ab: coeliac disease.

## Endocrine:

Thyroid peroxidase Ab: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (~87%), Graves' (>50%). Islet cell Ab (ICA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) Ab: type 1 diabetes mellitus (75%).

## Renal:

Glomerular basement membrane Ab (anti-GBM): Goodpasture's disease (100%).

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic Ab (ANCA):
- Cytoplasmic (cANCA), specific for serine proteinase-3 (PR3 +ve). Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (90%); also microscopic polyangiitis (30%), polyarteritis nodosa (11%).
- Perinuclear (pANCA), specific for myeloperoxidase (MPO +ve). Microscopic polyangiitis (45%), Churg-Strauss, pulmonary-renal vasculitides (Goodpasture's).

Unlike immune-complex vasculitis, in ANCA-associated vasculitis no complement consumption or immune complex deposition occurs (ie pauci-immune vasculitis).

ANCA may also be +ve in UC/Crohn's, sclerosing cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Felty's, RA, SLE, or drugs (eg antithyroid, allopurinol, ciprofloxacin).

## Neurological:

Acetylcholine receptor Ab: myasthenia gravis (90%)(see p512).
Anti-voltage-gated K+-channel Ab: limbic encephalitis.
Anti-voltage-gated Ca2+-channel Ab: Lambert-Eaton syndrome (see p512).
Anti-aquaporin 4: neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease, p698).

5 Most centres now use anti-CCP antibodies for the initial workup of suspected RA.
