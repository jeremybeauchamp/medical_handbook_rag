## Botulism

Neuroparalytic infection caused by neurotoxin from anaerobic, spore-forming Clostridium botulinum (rarely C. butyricum, C. barattii). Food-borne due to toxin production in food (botulus is Latin for sausage), or wound botulism due to spore germination in wound (includes IV drug use). Toxin blocks release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction causing flaccid paralysis. 

**Presentation:** Incubation up to 8d (usually 12-36h). Afebrile, descending, flaccid paralysis: diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia, progressive paralysis of limbs, respiratory failure. Autonomic signs: dry mouth, fixed/dilated pupils, urinary/cardiac/GI dysfunction. No sensory signs.

**Diagnosis:** Clinical: do not delay treatment. Take samples (serum, faeces, wound swab) for later confirmation by culture/PCR. In UK contact GI Bacteria Reference Unit (020 8327 7887). 

**Treatment:** Get help. Admit to ITU. Botulinum antitoxin (from Public Health England, Colindale 020 8200 4400), benzylpenicillin, metronidazole.

## Tetanus

Caused by anaerobic Clostridium tetani spores universally present in soil. Enters body via a breach in skin. Produces a neurotoxin (tetanospasmin) which disseminates via blood/lymphatics and interferes with neurotransmitter release causing unopposed muscle contraction and spasm (tetanus = 'to stretch'). ~6 cases/yr in England and Wales (2015). Maternal and neonatal tetanus important cause of preventable mortality in low-middle income countries. 

**Presentation:** Site of entry may be trivial/unnoticed. Incubation ~3-21d. Prodrome: fever, malaise, headache. Trismus (lockjaw, Greek 'trismos' = grinding). Risus sardonicus = a grin-like posture of hypertonic facial muscles. Opisthotonus (fig 9.45). Muscular spasms induced by movement, injections, noise, then spontaneous. Dysphagia. Autonomic dysfunction: arrhythmias ± fluctuating BP. Respiratory arrest. 

**Diagnosis:** Clinical. Detection of tetanus toxin/isolation of C. tetani. 

**Treatment:** Get help on ITU: level of supportive care predicts outcome. Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) IM (or equine antitetanus serum if not available). Take blood for detection of tetanus-toxin and anti-tetanus antibodies first. Wound debridement, metronidazole. Management of spasm: diazepam/lorazepam/midazolam (may need high doses IV), IV magnesium sulphate, baclofen (intra-thecal administration needed for penetration of blood-brain barrier - only with ICU ventilatory support), dantrolene, botulinum toxin-A.

**Vaccination:** Routine in UK (p407). Prophylaxis following injury: TIG if heavy contamination. If vaccination history unknown/incomplete: TIG plus dose of vaccine in a different site. Precautionary travel booster if >10y since last dose.

## Poliomyelitis

A highly infectious picornavirus, transmitted via faeco-oral route or contaminated food/water. Replicates in intestine. Invades nervous system with destruction of anterior horn cells/brain stem→irreversible paralysis. Incidence ↓by 99% since formation of Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. 74 cases in 2015. Remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2016).

**Presentation:** Incubation 7-10d. Flu-like prodrome in ~25%. Pre-paralytic stage: fever, ↑HR, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, tremor, limb pain. ~1 in 200 progress to paralytic stage: LMN/bulbar signs ± respiratory failure. No sensory signs. Post-polio syndrome in ~40% of survivors (up to 40y later): new progressive muscle weakness, myalgia, fatigue.

**Diagnosis:** Viral culture of stool (most sensitive, 2 samples >24h apart), pharyngeal swabs, blood, CSF. PCR can differentiate wild-type from vaccine. Paired serology. 

**Treatment:** None. 

**Vaccination:** Salk (inactivated, IM) or Sabin (live, oral). In previously endemic areas 200 million volunteers have vaccinated 3 billion children, preventing 1.5 million deaths in the last 20y.
