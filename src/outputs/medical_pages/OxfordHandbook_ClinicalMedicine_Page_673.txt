## When do varicose veins become an illness?

Perhaps when they hurt? Or is this too simple? 'Certain illnesses are desirable: they provide a compensation for a functional disorder...' (Albert Camus); this is known to be common with VVS. Perhaps many opt for surgery as a displacement activity to confronting deeper problems. We adopt the sickness role when we want sympathy. Somatization is hard to manage; here is one approach to consider:

- Give time; don't dismiss these patients as 'just the "worried well"'.
- Explore factors perpetuating illness behaviour (misinformation, social stressors).
- Agree a plan that makes sense to the patient's holistic view of themself.
- Treat any underlying depression (drugs and cognitive therapy, OHCS p344).
