# 530 Tumour markers

Tumour markers[^14] are specific molecules (usually glycoproteins) that may be found in higher concentrations in the serum, tissue, or urine in patients with certain cancers.

## Tumour markers in diagnosis

- Tumour markers are insufficiently sensitive or specific to be diagnostic in isolation.
- Many tumour markers are ↑ in several cancers and benign conditions (table 11.4).
- Measuring ≥1 tumour marker is unlikely to aid diagnosis unless suspecting a germ cell tumour.
- Do not make opportunistic requests for panels of tumour markers in patients with non-specific symptoms: they are not helpful and lead to potentially unnecessary investigation. This includes testing PSA in women and CA 125 in men.
- In carefully selected patients, in whom cancer is suspected, highly raised levels of a tumour marker may be helpful:
  - α-fetoprotein (αFP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in testicular/germ cell tumours.
  - CA 125 in combination with USS and menopausal status.
  - αFP in those at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.
  - PSA >100ng/mL usually indicates metastatic prostate cancer.

## Tumour markers in monitoring

The main value of tumour markers is in monitoring patients known to have cancer. This includes the course of the disease, the effectiveness of treatment, and the detection of cancer recurrence. The following markers may be useful:

- αFP and hCG in testicular/germ cell tumours.
- CEA in colorectal cancer.
- CA 125 in ovarian cancer.
- A cautious interpretation of PSA within the limits of its specificity and sensitivity.

## Screening for cancer

The UK has several well-established cancer screening programmes. Women are invited for mammography every 3yrs (50-70yrs) and offered cervical smear tests every 3-5yrs (25-64yrs). Men and women aged 60-74yrs are offered faecal occult blood testing every 2yrs.

Screening tests aim to pick out those who need further investigation to rule out or diagnose a cancer, in the hope that earlier diagnosis and treatment result in better outcomes. All screening tests come with risk: anxiety, harm/discomfort from the test, cost, false positives resulting in further invasive tests, false negatives conferring inappropriate reassurance when symptoms arise. When considering screening an asymptomatic population the potential risks and benefits need to be weighed carefully and the Wilson criteria (see p23) should be satisfied.

### Should PSA be used to screen for prostate cancer?

Most men with prostate cancer will have a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The higher the PSA, the more likely cancer is. However, PSA is non-specific and also raised in benign prostatic disease, BMI <25, recent ejaculation, recent rectal examination, prostatitis, and UTI. 76% of patients with a raised PSA do not have cancer. Following screening tests (see PROMIS study, 2017, for use of multi-parametric MRI), prostate biopsy is required for diagnosis. This has an inherent risk of complications including bleeding, infection, and urinary retention. ~1% will require hospital admission.

The risks of PSA testing and subsequent biopsy need to be counterbalanced by benefits from screening.[^15] ~1 in 800 men avoid death from prostate cancer as a result of PSA screening. But screening picks up many cancers that will never become fatal. This 'overdiagnosis' is thought to occur in ~40% of positive screens with significant risks from treatment including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and IHD. This balance of risk versus benefit means that population screening for prostate cancer using PSA is not recommended. Despite this, any patient >50yrs (or >45yrs if high risk) can request PSA testing in primary care. ▶ Interpret any PSA result in conjunction with digital rectal examination and other risk factors.
