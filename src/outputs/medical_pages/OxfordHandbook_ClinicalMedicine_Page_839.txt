The image shows a mostly blank white page with the following elements:

1. In the top left corner, the number "825" is printed.

2. On the right side of the page, there is a vertical red bar containing the word "Emergencies" written vertically from bottom to top.

3. At the bottom right corner, there is a small red triangle icon with an exclamation mark inside it, typically used as a warning or caution symbol.

This appears to be a section divider or chapter heading page for a document or manual, specifically for a section on emergencies.
