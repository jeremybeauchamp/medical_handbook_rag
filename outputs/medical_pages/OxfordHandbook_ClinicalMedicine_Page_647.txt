Fig 13.44 Internal and external haemorrhoids.

The image shows three anatomical diagrams illustrating the different types of haemorrhoids:

1. External haemorrhoid: The diagram shows the haemorrhoid originating below the dentate line.
2. Internal haemorrhoid: The diagram depicts the haemorrhoid originating above the dentate line.
3. Mixed haemorrhoid: The diagram illustrates haemorrhoids originating both above and below the dentate line.

Each diagram shows a cross-section of the anal canal and rectum, with the haemorrhoids represented as swollen blood vessels in the respective areas.
