# 770 Cardioversion/defibrillation

Do not wait for a crisis before familiarizing yourself with the defibrillator, as there are several types. All hospitals should include this information in your induction but check how the machine on your ward works.

## Indications
To restore sinus rhythm if VF/VT, AF, flutter, or supraventricular tachycardias if other treatments (p126) have failed, or there is haemodynamic compromise (p130 & p806). This may be done as an emergency, eg VF/VT, or electively, eg AF.

## Aim
To completely depolarize the heart using a direct current.

## Procedure
For VF/pulseless VT follow the ALS algorithm on p894 and call the arrest team!

- Unless critically unwell, conscious patients require a general anaesthetic or monitored heavy sedation.
- If elective cardioversion of AF ensure adequate anticoagulation beforehand.
- Almost all defibrillators are now paddle-free and use 'hands-free' pads instead (less chance of skin arc than jelly). Place the pads on chest, one over apex (p39) and one below right clavicle. The positions are often given by a diagram on the reverse of the pad.

### Cardioversion
Synchronize the shock with the rhythm by pressing the 'SYNC' button on the machine. This ensures the shock does not initiate a ventricular arrhythmia. However, this only works for cardioversion; if the sync mode is engaged in VF, the defibrillator will not discharge.

- Monophasic defibrillators: (fig 18.10) Set the energy level at 360J for VF/VT (arrest situation); 200J for AF; 50J for atrial flutter.
- Biphasic defibrillators: (fig 18.11) Impedance is less with a biphasic shock and 120-200J is used for shocks for VF/VT. They use less energy and are just as effective as monophasic defibs in cardioversion. 120-200J will cardiovert most arrhythmias.
- Automatic external defibrillators: (AEDs) Can be used by anyone who can turn them on and apply the pads. Follow the instructions given by the AED.

### Shocking
1. Consider anticoagulation in AF (see p130).
2. Clearly state that you are charging the defibrillator.
3. Make sure no one else is touching the patient, the bed, or anything is in turn touching these.
4. Clearly state that you are about to shock the patient.
5. Give the shock. If there is a change in rhythm before you shock and the shock is no longer required, turn the dial to 'discharge'. Do not allow anyone to approach until the reading has dropped to 0J.
6. After a shock: in resuscitation, resume CPR immediately and do not reassess rhythm until the end of the cycle (see p894, fig A3); in cardioversion, watch ECG; consider need to repeat the shock. Up to three are usual for AF/flutter.
7. Get an up-to-date 12-lead ECG.

In children, use 4J/kg in VF/VT; see OHCS p239.
