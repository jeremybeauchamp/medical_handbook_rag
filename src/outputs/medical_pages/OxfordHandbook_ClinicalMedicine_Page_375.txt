Table 8.9 HL subtypes

| Classification (% of cases) | Prognosis |
|----------------------------|-----------|
| Nodular sclerosing (70%)    | Good      |
| Mixed cellularity* (20-25%) | Good      |
| Lymphocyte rich (5%)        | Good      |
| Lymphocyte depleted* (<1%)  | Poor      |

NB: nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's is recognized as a separate entity, behaving as an indolent B-cell lymphoma.
*Higher incidence and worse prognosis if HIV +ve.

## Quality of life, lymphoma, and the role of expressive writing

Being treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma is arduous. Our job is often to give encouragement—the more this is personalized for our individual patient the better.

One method is to encourage our patients to write about their experiences. In one study this gave clear-cut benefits in lymphoma patients. Participants report positive responses to writing, and half said that writing changed their thoughts about their illness in a positive way (this increased on subsequent follow-up). Textual analysis identifies themes related to experiences of positive change, transformation, and self-affirmation through reflection. These techniques are akin to those used in post-traumatic stress—and remind us that some of our treatments are as destabilizing to our patients as any shipwreck or earthquake.

'I can whine, I can complain, I can moan, and bitch, about all of the above, but I won't.... The true feat isn't escaping death, rather, learning how to live.'

Sometimes narrating lymphoma experiences reveals bitterness, loss of control, and a feeling that life has been rendered void. Here our role is to receive these negatives and to try to keep the channels of communication open, as dialogue is the only validated means of filling these voids. The need to enhance support networks and bolster social ties may trump all our pharmacological imperatives.
