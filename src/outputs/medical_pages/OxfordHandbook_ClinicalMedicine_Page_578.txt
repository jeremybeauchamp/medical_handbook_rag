Fig 13.1 The Da Vinci robot, the first robotic surgery system to receive regulatory approval. With 4 arms, tiny, wristed tremor-free joints with multiple axes of rotation and high-resolution 3D imaging, the system offers the potential for significant advances in minimally invasive surgery, which are currently being realized across a range of fields. But where is the surgeon in this picture? At first glance, this technological tour de force may appear to supplant the skill of the human surgeonâ€”yet the machine must still possess an operator who must train and achieve all of the skills necessary to perform this challenging surgery. The history of surgery is one of adaptation of surgical skills to new technologies, from anaesthesia and asepsis to organ transplantation and laparoscopy. How can training pathways adapt in turn to allow for acquisition of these new skills without unacceptable patient risk? And whatever the surgical approach, the old maxim remains the same: the art of surgery lies in selecting the right operation at the right time for the right patient.
