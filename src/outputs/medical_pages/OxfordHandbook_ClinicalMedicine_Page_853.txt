## Investigations:
- Glucose, U&E, FBC, LFT, INR, ABG, ECG, paracetamol, and salicylate levels
- Urine/serum toxicology, specific assays as appropriate

## Monitor:
- T°, pulse, and respiratory rate, BP, O2 saturations, urine output ± ECG

## Treatment:
- Supportive measures: may need catheterization
- ↓Absorption: consider gastric lavage ± activated charcoal (see p840)

## Specific measures: 
See p840; for antidotes, see p842
Consider naloxone if ↓conscious level and pin-point pupils
Consider Pabrinex® and glucose if drowsy/confused
