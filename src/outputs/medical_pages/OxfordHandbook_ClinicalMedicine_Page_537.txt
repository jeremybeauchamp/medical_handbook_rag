## Cancer and the multidisciplinary team

The care of all patients diagnosed with cancer is formally reviewed by a multidisciplinary team (MDT). The aim of the MDT is to coordinate high-quality diagnosis, treatment, and care. The MDT should make a recommendation on the best initial treatment for cancer. Note: an MDT can only 'recommend'; the decision must be made in consultation with the patient. The MDT is made up of healthcare professionals with expertise in treating and supporting patients with cancer. Members should include, but are not limited to:

- lead clinician and lead nurse specialist
- radiologists (see BOX 'Interventional oncology', p527)
- histopathologists
- expert surgeons, eg upper GI, colorectal, breast, plastics
- oncologists (medical and clinical)
- palliative care physicians
- nominated member to support ongoing clinical trials
- patient representative
- administrative support.

## Cancer staging

Staging systems are used to describe the extent of a cancer. This is vital to determine the most appropriate treatment, to assess prognosis, and to identify relevant clinical trials. A cancer is always referred to by the stage given at diagnosis. The TNM system is most widely used and is based on the extent of tumour (T), spread to lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M) (table 11.1).

Table 11.1 TNM cancer staging

| T    | Description                              | N    | Description                    |
|------|------------------------------------------|------|--------------------------------|
| Tx   | Primary tumour cannot be measured        | Nx   | Nodes cannot be assessed       |
| T0   | Primary tumour cannot be found           | N0   | No node involvement            |
| Tis  | Carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells present)| N1-3 | Number/location of node metastases |
| T1-4 | Size and/or extent of primary tumour (1=small tumour /minimal invasion; 4=large tumour/extensive invasion) | M0 | No distant spread |
|      |                                          | M1   | Distant metastases             |

Other prefixes may also be used: c refers to clinical stage; p is the stage after pathological examination; y refers to stage after neoadjuvant therapy; r is used if a tumour is re-staged after a disease-free interval; a indicates stage at autopsy.

The TNM staging may be converted to an overall, less detailed classification of cancer stage: 0-IV. Stage 0 refers to carcinoma in situ; Stages I-III describe the size of cancer and/or nearby spread; Stage IV indicates metastatic disease.

Some cancers may have alternative staging systems such as Duke's classification for colorectal cancer (p616). See also lung cancer (p176); breast cancer (p602); oesophageal cancer (p618); bladder cancer (p647).

## Cancer imaging

Imaging is essential in oncology for diagnosis, prognosis, and to inform and guide treatment. As well as plain radiographs, ultrasound scans, CT, and MRI; there is a wealth of more specialist imaging including:

PET-CT: PET uses a non-specific radioactive tracer (FDG) which highlights areas of increased metabolism, cell proliferation, or hypoxia. It therefore accumulates in cancer cells >non-cancer cells. PET-CT is a powerful combination of anatomical (CT) and functional (PET) information allowing diagnosis, increased accuracy of staging, and assessment of treatment response.

Monoclonal antibodies: Radio-labelled tumour antibodies specific to the tumour under investigation, eg prostate specific membrane antigen, somatostatin (neuroendocrine tumours), oestrogen receptor (breast). They can offer better specificity than standard PET images. (For monoclonal antibodies in treatment see p524.)

Bone scintigraphy (bone scan): Detects abnormal metabolic activity in bones including bone metastases.
