## Broad complex tachycardia

ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complexes >120ms (>3 small squares on ECGs done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s). Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly.

### Differential diagnosis (See p128.)
- Ventricular tachycardia (VT) including torsade de pointes. Single ventricular ectopics should not cause confusion; if >3 together at a rate >100, this is VT.
- SVT (p806) with aberrant conduction, eg AF or atrial flutter, with bundle branch block.
- Pre-excited tachycardias, eg AF, atrial flutter, or AV re-entry tachycardia, with underlying WPW (p133).

### Identifying the underlying rhythm (See p128.)
If in doubt, treat as VT.

### Management
See fig 19.9.
- Connect patient to a cardiac monitor and have a defibrillator to hand.
- Monitor O2 sats and if <90% give supplemental oxygen.
- Correct electrolyte abnormalities, esp K+ and Mg2+.
- Check for adverse signs. Low cardiac output (clammy, ↓consciousness, BP <90); oliguria; angina; pulmonary oedema.
- Obtain 12-lead ECG (request CXR) and obtain IV access.

#### If haemodynamically unstable VT:
Synchronized DC shock (see p894, fig A3).
- Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h, and 4mL 50% magnesium sulfate over 30min both via central line.
- Follow with amiodarone 300mg IV over 10-20min (peripherally only in emergency).
- For refractory cases consider procainamide or sotalol.

#### If haemodynamically stable VT:
Correct hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: as above.
- Amiodarone 300mg IV over 20-60min (avoid if long QT) via central line.
- If this fails, use synchronized DC shock.

#### After correction of VT:
Establish the cause (via the history and tests described above).
- Maintenance anti-arrhythmic therapy may be required. If VT occurs after MI, give IV amiodarone infusion for 12-24h; if 24h after MI, also start oral anti-arrhythmic: sotalol (if good LV function) or amiodarone (if poor LV function).
- Prevention of recurrent VT: surgical isolation of the arrhythmogenic area or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may help.

### Ventricular fibrillation:
(ECG p129, fig 3.29) Use non-synchronized DC shock (there is no R wave to trigger defibrillation, p770): see p894, fig A3.

### If SVT with aberrant conduction:
Manage as SVT with eg adenosine (see p806).

### Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics):
These are the commonest post-MI arrhythmia but they are also seen in healthy people (often >10/h). Patients with frequent ectopics post-MI have a worse prognosis, but there is no evidence that antidysrhythmic drugs improve outcome, indeed they may increase mortality.

### Torsade de pointes:
A form of VT, with a constantly varying axis, often in the setting of long QT syndromes (ECG p129, fig 3.31). Causes (p711): congenital or from drugs (eg some antidysrhythmics, tricyclics, antimalarials, antipsychotics). Torsade in the setting of congenital long-QT syndromes can be treated with high doses of β-blockers.

In acquired long-QT syndromes (p711), stop all predisposing drugs, correct hypokalaemia, and give magnesium sulfate (2g IV over 10min). Alternatives include: overdrive pacing (pace at a faster rate, then slow reduce) or isoprenaline IVI to increase heart rate.
